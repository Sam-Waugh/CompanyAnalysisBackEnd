Most of the\ncompanies are multinationals, all with more than $500\nmillion in revenue. For this year’s edition, we conducted\nadditional surveys with executives in Japan and China\n(50 in each country) to expand our view into those\nunique consumer markets.

On the one hand, they are negative\nabout the macro environment. Eight in 10 respondents say\nthey are neutral or leaning pessimistic about the global\neconomy and geopolitical stability. Seven in 10 assume high\nenergy prices and higher input costs will be with us for a year\nor longer. The same holds for supply chain challenges and the\nRussia-Ukraine conflict.1\nAt the same time, despite these headwinds, they are bullish\non their own companies. Three in four are optimistic about\ntheir company’s performance (74%) and its strategy (80%).\nTime will tell if that optimism is warranted, especially as more\nthan one-third of the top performers in our financial analysis\nhave analysts that cover them forecasting negative earnings\nper share growth.\nGlobally, four in 10\nConsumers also bring their perspectives and realities. Globally,\nfour in 10 consumers surveyed feel their financial situation consumers surveyed\nworsened over the past year. This sentiment is prevalent across\nincome groups and connected to significant shifts in spending feel their financial situation\nintentions. Less than half (43%) have paycheck money left over\nat the end of the month after expenses. Only one in three are worsened over the past year.\noptimistic that their financial situation will improve in the next\nyear. These same consumers are two times more likely to be\nworried about their savings and delaying large purchases.\nThey’re also 1.5 times more likely to be concerned about\nmonthly payments (which may signal future credit defaults).2\nSo, although individual companies may have their unique\nreasons for optimism, there are scenarios where consumers\nexhaust their savings and face a softening labor market,\nleaving little for continued expenditure.3 Consumer products\ncompanies should not ignore such downside possibilities.\n(For an economist’s perspective, see The economic outlook\nfor the consumer products industry).\n62023 consumer products industry outlook\nThe economic outlook for the consumer products industry\nThe pandemic shocked the global economy, but so has its aftermath. The consumer products\nindustry enters 2023 with an economy experiencing ruinous inflation, rapid tightening monetary\npolicy, and recessionary risk. Consumer behavior and supply chains are still disrupted, and crises\nfrom war to weather add to the turmoil. All things being equal, it would take time for the global\neconomy to return to normalcy. But uncertainty and fear undermine political support for a return\nto the basics of globalization. The coming decade, therefore, will be different than before.\nInflation arrived largely as a consequence of supply chain disruption, amplified by the whiplash\nof consumers rapidly switching from services to goods in the pandemic. Now, with the pandemic\nperceived as being over, consumers are shifting back to services and cutting spending on goods.\nThis development should help alleviate inflationary pressure but creates some headwinds for\nconsumer product sales. Oil and other commodity prices have declined as the global economy has\nweakened, providing additional hope for reduced inflation and cheaper transportation and inputs\nfor the industry.\nStill, once it goes up, inflation is hard to bring down. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts\nworldwide average inflation to remain stubbornly high at 6.5% in 2023. Central banks in Europe and\nNorth America are rapidly tightening monetary policy to stifle inflation. The US Federal Reserve is\nlikely to continue tightening by raising interest rates until it is objectively evident inflation is receding.\nThese actions may increase the likelihood of recession.\nOne casualty of war is the global market for grain and fertilizer, much of which is produced in\nUkraine and Russia. Disruption of production and distribution led to a big increase in food prices,\nwhich is likely to persist, especially given the fertilizer shortage. Weather and climate are also playing\ntheir roles. For example, drought in the United States affects transportation on the Mississippi and\ncattle production in ways that may be felt for a few years. Combined, this means greater price\nsensitivity on the part of consumers, at least in advanced economies.\nSpeaking of consumers, although labor markets are tight in Europe and North America, wages\nhave not kept pace with inflation, thereby leading to a decline in real incomes. In the United States,\nconsumers have offset this problem by dipping into their savings. In Canada and Europe, however,\nreal spending has declined. Japan’s economy has lately seen improvement as COVID-related\nrestrictions were lifted, and pent-up consumer demand led to strong retail spending growth.\nOn the other hand, the sharp rise in energy and food prices and a falling yen have weakened\nhousehold incomes. In China, retail spending was growing, but slowly. The state of global consumer\nhealth factors into the IMF’s modest forecast for real GDP growth of only 2.7% in 2023.\nAlthough global supply chain stress has eased since the worst of the pandemic, supply chains\nare not yet back to normal. As consumer products companies struggle to obtain the inputs and\ncommodities they require, they also face a changing geopolitical and business environment. This\ninvolves governmental restrictions on technology transfer, fraught relations between the world’s\ngreatest powers, and increased regionalization of supply chains. It also involves new efforts by\nglobal companies to reinforce supply chain resilience and redundancy, partly by diversifying supply\nchain processes and no longer depending on just one country or supplier. As a result, we may begin\nto see a consumer products industry emerge that is, in many ways, more diverse than before.\n—Dr. Ira Kalish\nChief Global Economist, Deloitte\n772023 consumer products industry outlook\nChecking in on challenges\nWith reasons to be optimistic or not, the industry is nonetheless Supply chain\nexpected to face several challenges, including some holdovers Supply chain operations may have seen improvements from\nfrom the prior year—namely, labor, supply chain, and inflation.4 the height of the pandemic disruption, but it still rates as a\ntop concern among industry executives: 62% of respondents\nLabor expect supply chain issues will be quite or extremely challenging\nOf the three big challenges executives called out for 2022, in 2023.\nlabor made the most positive progress—though the nature\nof the challenge may be changing.

Embracing the changing consumer\nWhat consumers want has changed dramatically and frequently during the past several years ,\nand profitable growers expect that trend to continue. Eight in 10 executives in our survey consider\nthe changing consumer as one of their greatest challenges, and 93% say keeping up with changing\nconsumer demands is a priority (+22 percentage points higher than all other companies).\nBut when it comes down to it, profitable growth companies are finding ways to get closer to\nconsumers, mainly through more significant digital investments that help them engage and\npersonalize. For example, some companies let consumers try on clothes virtually or provide AI-\nenabled product recommendations. Others are working behind the scenes to improve sales and\ncustomer lifetime value performance with predictive analytics models working in close to real time.\nInvestments in direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels and in protecting the consumer data that makes\nthese systems function also rate highly in the plans of profitable growth companies. But be warned\nthat DTC models at large incumbent brands have struggled for profitability and are not for the faint\nof heart.12 A business-to-business wholesale model differs from direct retailing, and it can be hard\nto do both. New regulatory and technological changes to consumer tracking, for example, around\ncookies and opt-in requirements, are making it harder still by increasing customer acquisition and\nmarketing costs.\nGetting closer to the changing consumer Profitable growers All others Percentage point\n(pp) difference\nInvesting in creating or improving a direct-to-consumer\n93% 42% +51 pp\nsales channel*\nAgree improving consumer data privacy and cybersecurity\n89% 61% +28 pp\nis critical to digital strategy\nInvesting in technology to improve ability to engage with\n86% 50% +36 pp\nconsumers and employees*\nInvesting in ability to personalize the consumer experience* 86% 54% +32 pp\nAgree the ability to personalize the consumer experience\n80% 65% +15 pp\nwill be key to differentiating offerings\nBased on Deloitte’s analysis of executive interviews for the 2023 consumer products industry outlook.

They invest more in product innovation and use data\nfrom their digital engagement systems to quickly identify new opportunities. Successful companies\nin our financial analysis also pursued product premiumization. We saw this innovation strategy gain\npopularity over the past year, as premiumization helps to justify price increases to consumers by\nproviding additional value.13\nImproving product innovation Profitable growers All others Percentage point\n(pp) difference\nPrioritizing the introduction of new products/services* 86% 46% +40 pp\nInvesting in product innovation 77% 42% +35 pp\nUsing sophisticated analytics to identify opportunities for\n77% 56% +21 pp\nnew brands and products\nInvesting in health and wellness trends 72% 53% +19 pp\nBased on Deloitte’s analysis of executive interviews for the 2023 consumer products industry outlook.*N = 53: Comparing responses of One of our very top\npriorities and A clear priority.

Going for market share\nProfitable growth companies think the challenging business environment expected for this year provides an\nexcellent opportunity to grow share (85%, +33 percentage points higher than all other companies). They are\nmore likely to say growing share is one of their top priorities. The top companies in our financial analysis are\nall growing share relative to their peers on a three-year basis. Such share growth is important as, among\nother benefits, it helps improve unit volumes and opens subsequent opportunities for economies of scale.\nHow do they plan to go about it? Some may raise prices yet keep them lower than competitor sand use\npromotions. The potential to undercut on price is there as those companies that don’t anticipate profitable\ngrowth may have their hand forced—they are four times more likely to say their input prices are increasing\nsignificantly. Seven in 10 profitable growers are looking to grow their share by investing in emerging\nmarkets. And as pointed out earlier, they are investing in more innovative products to attract changing\nconsumers. But the most dramatic differences are in marketing (including digital marketing) and expanding\nby acquisition.\nGoing for market share Profitable growers All others Percentage point\n(pp) difference\nPlan to increase market share in 2023 85% 49% +36 pp\nInvesting more in marketing and advertising 79% 30% +49 pp\nPrioritize expanding by acquisition* 48% 21% +27 pp\nBased on Deloitte’s analysis of executive interviews for the 2023 consumer products industry outlook. N = 150: Comparing responses of Increased Somewhat\nand Increased Significantly. *N = 53: Comparing responses of One of our very top priorities and A clear priority .\n3. Creatively transforming\nProfitable growers are changing their businesses as consumer needs evolve. For some (two-thirds) ,\nthis involves transformation through divestitures and portfolio optimization. Creative examples in the\nmarketplace include joint ventures and innovative partnerships with private equity to turn over businesse s\nthat would operate better externally. Some brands might even be able to form private equity funds to\nfacilitate these deals.\nProfitable growers are doing something else unique: vertical integration. Integration may provide flexibility\nin times of significant turbulence. It is not without potential downsides, but it can be used as a lever to\ngain greater control, ensure supply, and protect margins from input cost increases. Ratings agencies and\nfinancial firms suggest vertical integration is behind the success of meat companies in recent years, crediting\nintegration with increasing their efficiency, providing a natural hedge to input price swings, and improving\ntraceability.14 In another example, research in the fashion industry reflects backward integration enables\ncompanies to gain more data and improve their ability to make product-specific claims, such as around\nsustainability.15\nCreatively transforming Profitable growers All others Percentage point\n(pp) difference\nPursuing vertical integration as a strategy\n68% 32% +36 pp\n(i.e., owning more parts of the value chain)\nInvesting in divestitures and portfolio optimization 66% 44% +22 pp\nBased on Deloitte’s analysis of executive interviews for the 2023 consumer products industry outlook.

Driving data through supply chains\nLike cost cutting, the supply chain is a priority for almost every company. More than nine in 10 companies in\nour survey are investing in supply chain improvement and operational excellence, so it doesn’t differentiate.\nAdditionally, those companies that say they are moving beyond just-in-time supply chain strategies are\nabout as likely to be profitable growers as any other consumer products company.\nHowever, supply chain data is an area where profitable growers stand out. They are much more likely to\ninvest in data capabilities and want to share more data with consumers and partners. This data can help\npower smart labels to help consumers make better decisions and can help supply chain partners coordinate\nand optimize logistics. Companies with these capabilities are likely better positioned to meet tracking and\ntraceability requirements. And it enables other capabilities, such as assessing supply chain carbon\nfootprints (79%, +38 percentage points higher than all other companies) and monitoring and complying\nwith ethical working practices (89%, +25 percentage points higher than all other companies). Examples from\nhigher performers in our financial analysis include new product labeling systems incorporating carbon\nemissions, ocean acidification, and biodiversity—all enabled by supply chain data.\nSupply chain data Profitable growers All others Percentage point\n(pp) difference\nInvesting in increasing the level of transparency\n90% 46% +44 pp\nprovided to consumers and other stakeholders\nInvesting in improving capabilities to safely share data\n76% 50% +26 pp\nwith partners\nMaking a significant investment in collecting more\n48% 21% +27 pp\ndetailed data from supply chains*\nBased on Deloitte’s analysis of executive interviews for the 2023 consumer products industry outlook.

Prioritizing ESG\nProfitable growers are more committed to environmental, social, and governance objectives.\nExamples from high performers in our financial analysis include investments in reusable packaging\nand bottles, deforestation prevention initiatives, sustainable palm oil sourcing efforts, and climate-\nsmart farming practices.\nA differentiating factor is that profitable growers invest in improving their ESG reporting. Those that\ndo this tend to outperform in making sustainability progress, based on past research16. And their\ninvestments in DEI may be helping profitable growers, as they don’t need to emphasize hiring and\nretaining top talent in their priorities at the same rate as all other companies (45%; -30 percentage\npoints lower than all other companies).\nNote that the economy’s continued deterioration may make it more difficult to keep these priorities\nat the top of the list. Though many consumers value sustainability, we’ve already seen signs of a\npullback in willingness to pay a premium for sustainability1.7\nPrioritizing ESG Profitable growers All others Percentage point\n(pp) difference\nAgree becoming more environmentally sustainable\n97% 58% +39 pp\nis a priority*\nInvesting in increasing environmental, social, and governance\n83% 50% +33 pp\n(ESG) reporting*\nIncreasing the company’s positive impact on society\n76% 50% +26 pp\nis a priority*\nInvesting in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 75% 47% +28 pp\nPlan to participate in the circular economy 68% 44% +24 pp\nBased on Deloitte’s analysis of executive interviews for the 2023 consumer products industry outlook.
