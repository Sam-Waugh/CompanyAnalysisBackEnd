The goal of this annual study is to answer\nimportant questions that can help companies prioritize and\nbetter position their business strategies and investments.\nThe shift to EVs is happening, but is it moving fast enough in some markets?\nConsumer interest in EVs is growing as consumers, pressured by hyper-inflationary\nconditions, look to lower their operating costs. However, individual markets face\ndifferent challenges to maintain forward momentum. Affordability, range anxiety,\nand battery safety concerns remain as significant barriers to adoption.\nAn unintended benefit of the vehicle inventory crisis\nProduct quality still tops the list of factors driving consumer decisions when it comes\nto which vehicle brand to buy, but expectations regarding the acceptable length of\ntime to wait for delivery may be starting to stretch out as a lasting by-product of the\ninventory crisis, potentially opening the door to a new “build-to-order” paradigm.\nDealers engender the most trust among consumers\nWhen asked who they trust most, a majority of surveyed consumers across global\nmarkets point to the relationship they have with either their selling or servicing\ndealer, signaling the important role dealers play in the automotive value chain and\na key consideration in the conversation around direct-to-consumer sales.\nSubscriptions to connected vehicle services could be a challenge\nConsumer interest in connected vehicle features that provide updates regarding\ntraffic congestion, road safety, and vehicle health status are relatively high, but\npeople would much rather pay for connected technologies as part of the upfront\ncost of the vehicle or on a per use basis compared to a subscription.\n31\nVehicle\nelectrification2023 Deloitte Global Automotive Consumer Study\nThe global shift to electrified vehicles is happening at very different speeds depending on the individual market.\nInterest in hybrid technology also continues to outstrip full battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in most countries\nexcept China.\nPreference for type of engine in next vehicle\nICE (2022)\nUS 62% 20% 8% 8% 3% 69%\nIndia 53% 20% 12% 8% 6% 58%\nSoutheast Asia 51% 17% 15% 13% 3% 66%\nGermany 51% 15% 12% 16% 7% 49%\nChina 45% 14% 12% 27% 1% 58%\nRep. of Korea 38% 27% 13% 17% 6% 37%\nJapan 36% 36% 12% 13% 4% 39%\nGasoline/diesel (ICE) Hybrid electric (HEV) Plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) Battery electric (BEV) Other\nNote: Other includes vehicles with engine types such as compressed natural gas, ethanol, and hydrogen fuel cells; “don’t know” responses weren’t considered.\nQ40: What type of engine would you prefer in your next vehicle?\nSample size: n= 703 [China]; 1,128 [Germany]; 948 [India]; 567 [Japan]; 806 [Republic of Korea]; 5,089 [Southeast Asia]; 1,766 [US]\nNote throughout: Sum of the values in selected charts may not add to 100% due to rounding.\nDespite government messaging around the need to address climate change, the shift to EVs is primarily\nbased on a strong consumer perception that it will significantly reduce vehicle operating costs.\nTop reasons to choose an EV as next vehicle\nRep. of Southeast\nFactors China Germany India Japan US\nKorea Asia\nLower fuel costs 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\nBetter driving experience 1 4 2 3 3 2 2\nConcern about climate change 8 2 5 7 7 6 3\nLess maintenance 7 5 3 6 4 3 4\nGovernment incentives/subsidies/\n6 3 7 2 2 5 5\nstimulus programs\nPotential for extra taxes/levies applied to\n5 6 8 5 5 8 6\ninternal combustion vehicles\nConcern about personal health 4 7 6 8 8 7 7\nAbility to use the vehicle as a backup\n3 8 4 4 6 4 8\nbattery/power source (e.g., for home)\nPeer pressure 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nTop reason\nQ41: Please rank the following factors in terms of their impact on your decision to acquire an electrified vehicle (highest to lowest).\nSample size: n= 374 [China]; 478 [Germany]; 384 [India]; 345 [Japan]; 453 [Republic of Korea]; 2,305 [Southeast Asia]; 618 [US]\n52023 Deloitte Global Automotive Consumer Study\nA focus on building public charging capacity is needed to address concerns over range anxiety, but\nthe reality of day-to-day usage means most people will charge their EVs at home.
