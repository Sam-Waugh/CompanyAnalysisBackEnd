While the core objective of the mining industry\nremains unchanged going forward: to extract and\nprovide metals and minerals to downstream sectors,\nmany of the factors that have influenced how mining\ncompanies should look, feel, and act in the past, have\nshifted in recent years.\nThe way in which companies fulfil this mission is\nnow open to interpretation. And today, there is a\nrare opportunity for leaders to reorganize, generate\nnew value, and forge partnerships to create a more\nresponsible and attractive future for the industry.\nWhile some early movers saw the need for change\ncoming 10, 15, even 20 years ago and have been\nredefining their organizations and operations\naccordingly, for many firms, the necessity for\nfundamental change only really hit home in 2020-21.\nThe convergence of factors including the ongoing\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world of\nwork, continued drive towards digitization, the growing\nneed to integrate ESG commitments with central\nbusiness functions, and the need to pivot in response\nto fast-moving business and operating environments,\nhas opened many choices for companies.\n2Introduction\nOf course, the biggest underlying driver and opportunity for transformation lies in the green energy transition. The 2021\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow in November, highlighted the mining industry’s\nintegral role in supplying the metals and materials critical for a low-carbon future1. The way in which mining companies\nposition themselves today in preparation for this change, will determine their sustainability, and could make or break their\ncompetitive advantage over the next decade.\nChange on this scale is undoubtably daunting, which is why in this, its 14th year, Tracking the trends has focused on\neffecting transformation. The following 10 trends provide a toolkit to help mining companies start thinking through, and\nmoving towards, their vision of future success.\nIn them, our global team of experts share insights and case studies designed to get ideas flowing. We explore how to\nevolve traditional mining and metals businesses through new business models, capital allocation, agile work practices,\nand data-driven technologies to create organizations fit for the 21st century; ones that can not only survive but profit from\nwhatever the future might throw at them and leave a positive social impact in their wake.\nThe next decade will be one of the most exciting and transformative in the mining industry’s history.

Miners could use the\nSustainably Advantaged Portfolio framework detailed in Trend one to explore synergies and value-\ncreating opportunities based on their current portfolio and future investments, particularly those\nsurrounding environmental, social governance (ESG).\n• Look for loops: Explore opportunities to build circular loops into current production processes\nand design out waste. In certain instances, tailings can provide a source of residual metals and\nminerals ripe for secondary prospectivity. Characterization of both fresh and historical mine wastes\nwill enable potential new streams of revenue to be identified and reprocessing options evaluated.\nApproaches like this could provide a powerful narrative to the market.\n• Collaborate for circular products: According to the Global e-waste Statistics Partnership, 53.6Mt\nof e-waste was generated globally in 2019, but only 17.4% was properly recycled.15 Part of the issue\nis that recycling processes are often developed retrospective of materials, and, therefore, are either\nsub-optimal or large quantities of waste material have accumulated by the time they come into\nplay. Mining companies should consider partnering with customers and others in their value chain\nto improve recycling processes for future materials. Collaborating to develop new products and\nmaterials that could replace metals in instances where supply might fall short could also reduce the\nrisk of disruption. We should acknowledge that these businesses would often require new capability\nsets relative to what miners have today.\n14Trend 2: Reshaping traditional value chains\nEndnotes:\n1. “Woodside and BHP to create a global energy company,” BHP, published 17 August 2021, accessed https://www.\nbhp.com/news/media-centre/releases/2021/08/woodside-and-bhp-to-create-a-global-energy-company accessed 30\nNovember 2021.\n2. “Rio Tinto enters scandium market with construction of new plant in Canada,” Rio Tinto, published 14 January 2021\nhttps://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2021/Rio-Tinto-enters-scandium-market-with-construction-of-new-plant-in-\nCanada, accessed 30 November 2021.\n3. “Rio Tinto to build new tellurium plant at Kennecott mine,” Rio Tinto, published 8 March 2021 https://www.riotinto.com/\nen/news/releases/2021/Rio-Tinto-to-build-new-tellurium-plant-at-Kennecott-mine, accessed 30 November 2021.\n4. “BHP and POSCO ink MoU to explore decarbonised steelmaking,” BHP, published 30 November 2021 https://www.bhp.\ncom/news/media-centre/releases/2021/10/bhp-and-posco-ink-mou-to-explore-decarbonised-steelmaking, accessed 30\nNovember 2021.\n5. “BHP and POSCO ink MoU to explore decarbonised steelmaking,” BHP, published 30 November 2021 https://www.bhp.\ncom/news/media-centre/releases/2021/10/bhp-and-posco-ink-mou-to-explore-decarbonised-steelmaking, accessed 30\nNovember 2021.\n6.

In these cases, ESG\ncan be designed into the heart of the business and becomes part of the way the company operates\nfrom exploration to mining, to operations and decommissioning.\n• Test structures regularly: Established organizations that have made bold ESG commitments\nhave begun to put structures and processes in place to support them, and it is crucial that these\nconnections or lines of reporting are tested regularly. Audits are an effective way to do this. Internal\nor external auditors can assess whether a company is meeting its commitments at every level. A key\nsuccess factor is then ensuring that the results of the assessment go beyond the mine manager and\nthat information is shared at senior executive levels. This enables change to be effected from the\ntop if shortcomings are identified.\n• Quantify the risk: Once companies quantify the level of risk associated with social or\nenvironmental failures—such as the impact of an ESG re-rating among key investors or the\nexclusion of a stock in an index—it becomes easier to make the case for capital allocation into ESG-\ndriven organizational restructures, resource allocation and the creation of new roles. The latter will\ncost much less than the former.\n• Create a transparent and agile ESG culture: If an audit or risk-management exercise reveals that\nthe organizationa structure is not working as it should—perhaps a key role or communications\nchannel is lacking—then it’s important that leaders facilitate positive action based upon it. This is a\nlearning journey for many organizations, and adjustments and changes will need to be made. Being\ncongruent in what is said and what is do will be the most important currency to build credibility.\n• Revaluate incentives: Incentives are a powerful behavioral lever within organizations. Companies\nshould re-evaluate current incentive structures and align these with the broader ESG agenda.\n• Define ESG responsibilities across the value chain: ESG-related expectations and responsibilities\nneed to be written into roles at every level of the organization and at every stage of the value chain.\nAligning these responsibilities within functional mandates to ensure that individuals are empowered\nto make decisions and take action should be considered. Miners must clearly communicate their\nexpectations around key internal and external interfaces, both verbally and in writing, so that\nthere’s strong alignment—particularly with regard to supply-chain partners.\n24Tracking the trends 2022\nEndnotes:\n1. “Mining and the SDGs: huge potential, limited action,” Responsible Mining Foundation, published 17 September 2020\nhttps://www.responsibleminingfoundation.org/media/sdgs2020/, accessed 29 October 2021.\n2. “Sustainable development: The 17 goals,” United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2021 https://sdgs.\nun.org/goals, accessed 1 December 2021.\n25Tracking the trends 2022\nTrend 5\nEvolving mining’s world of work\nPositioning organizations for an increasingly\ncompetitive labor market\nJanine Nel, Partner, Consulting, Deloitte Canada\nMarcello Cordova Alvestegui, Director, Consulting, Deloitte Chile\n26Trend 5: Evolving mining’s world of work\nLike many industries, the mining sector has felt the industry for younger generations is clear.

Studies\nshow the impact this can have on consumer choices, where 87% of respondents said they would\nbuy a product based on the company’s stand for a societal issue. This trend is even higher among\nmillennials and zoomers who also look at corporate social purpose when choosing a workplace, with\n64% considering a company’s social and environmental commitments before employment.3\n• Consider introducing hybrid or permanent virtual/remote work arrangements: Virtual/\nremote work has become a hiring and retention appeal and will allow miners to leverage skills in\ngeographies where they previously lacked them. Remote-job postings on LinkedIn increased more\nthan five times between March and December 2021, and 46% of workers are planning to move\nto a new location in the next year because they can now work remotely.4 According to LinkedIn\ndata, since April 2020, internal-mobility hiring has also increased by almost 20% year-on-year,5\ndemonstrating the need to adapt virtual/remote work practices for employee value proposition.\n• Rethink the skills required: Review the required skills for different roles and consider how recruits\ncould potentially be sourced from other industries. Looking to adjacent industries for talent could\nprovide access to a wider pool of applicants and support culture change and new performance\nstandards within teams.\n• Consider technologies, HR and training requirements that can widen talent pool: Including\nreskilling and training programs that can deliver or support workforce needs and broaden new\nopportunities. Deloitte’s Human Capital Trends 2020 survey found that, while 74% of organizations\nsurveyed said that reskilling the workforce is important for their success, only 9% said they are\nready to address this issue.6\n• Reduce labor barriers for underrepresented groups: To foster a more diverse workforce, mining\ncompanies must lower barriers for under-represented talent, including women, immigrants,\nand those with disabilities. Indigenous communities account for a valuable and, in many cases,\nuntapped source of talent, not just for blue-collar positions but for management positions too.

While this is helpful from an audit or compliance perspective, it means they often don’t\nadequately capture the importance of meaningful consultation.\nTo supplement standard metrics, companies could develop their own systems to record qualitative\ndata such as the number and diversity of their Indigenous employees, whether they have\nIndigenous people on boards or committees, the number of Indigenous businesses that participate\nin their procurement and supply chains, and financial support or donations provided to\nIndigenous projects.\n• Develop templates that reduce risk and improve decision-making: There are examples in\nCanada where First Nations are leading the permitting or regulatory process for major development\nprojects or are involved with the environmental assessment. There are also examples in multiple\njurisdictions where Indigenous communities are raising funds to increase their participation in\na project or take ownership of enabling infrastructure. Mining companies should have a vested\ninterest in building these types of relationships and encourage participation, as Indigenous insights\ncould significantly improve the economic and environmental performance of mining projects.\n• Early engagement in a culturally appropriate manner: Engagement with communities should\nbegin as early on in a project as possible and continue throughout the project lifecycle. The\ninvestment required to establish a meaningful two-way dialogue is far less than that required\nfor legal challenges, or to rebuild a relationship after litigation. Reputational costs should also be\nconsidered. Information should be provided to communities in a way that is culturally appropriate,\nand in their Indigenous language so that they can make informed decisions around consent.\n• Diverse governance: Creating seats for Indigenous representatives on boards and in other\npositions of power within mining companies will give communities greater confidence in the\npurpose and direction of mining projects. It will also give them a central role in decision-making\nprocesses, including those related to mitigating environmental and social impacts.\n• Understand the need for different relationships and roles in different geographies: While\nthere is a global awakening underway around Indigenous issues, it is happening in different ways\nin different countries and regions. While there are some common themes, there is no universal\nblueprint for how community-mining company relationships and roles should be structured.

Review this regularly to ensure OT cybersecurity measures are sufficient and\nproperly allocated.\n• Uncover asset vulnerabilities: Perform a passive detection of the network by collecting and\nanalyzing traffic circulating between OT devices. This will allow vulnerabilities in the discovered assets\nto be uncovered.\n• Perform regular OT security assessments: Assessments allow the identification of security\ngaps and missing controls, and can help leaders to gauge the maturity level of their organization’s\napproach to OT cybersecurity. Based on this, recommendations can be made on work lots to achieve\ntarget maturity and strategic deployment roadmaps built to support this effort.\n• OT third-party risk assessment: Conduct a workshop with critical third-party stakeholders, such as\noriginal equipment manufacturers or service providers, to discuss the controls in place to secure the\ninterface between their systems and the mine’s. Ensure these are robust and up to date.\n• Create an OT governance framework: Establish a corporate-wide security objective for OT by\ndefining the OT cybersecurity strategy. Also, create a functional IT/OT governance working model.\n• Consider an IT-compromise assessment: It’s also worth assessing the current IT environment,\ninfrastructure, and selected systems to identify previously undetected backdoors, compromises, or\nexposures that reveal data and system integrity to significant risks.\n• Perform a thorough market review: The traditional OT security market is niche and mature.\nHowever, OT/IT convergence is accelerating, and a growing number of cyber-physical systems are\nemerging in operational and mission-centric environments, creating a new security market with\nshifting dynamics. It’s worth scanning the market on a regular basis to ensure access to the latest\nsecurity systems and services.\n48Tracking the trends 2022\nEndnotes:\n1.
