When the Public Health\nEmergency (PHE) ends, states need to unwind the continuous\neligibility requirement, redetermine eligibility for current\nenrollees, and return to normal operations.\nAs states look to the future, CMCS aims to help states to:\nClose the Medicaid coverage gap in the\n12 states that have not expanded Medicaid\nIncrease and strengthen eligibility and\nenrollment to reduce churn and improve the\ncontinuity of coverage\nBroaden access to home- and community-\nbased services (HCBS) to expand access to\nservices and encourage state innovation\nElevating the future of Medicaid | Connection, collaboration, and care 3Health equity\nCMS defines health equity as attaining the highest level of health for all people,\nwhere everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their optimal health\nregardless of race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity,\nsocioeconomic status, geography, preferred language, and other factors that affect\naccess to care.[2]\nEfforts to improve health equity and reduce disparities in access to\ncoverage and health care services likely will require a sustained and\ncommitted effort across many parts of the Medicaid program.\nInnovations in delivery systems and other program enhancements\nhave improved access to care and services. However, there are still\ninequities. Addressing these inequities could continue to improve the\nhealth and well-being of program beneficiaries. CMCS has identified\na number of priorities, including:\nImproving data collection and analysis to\nexpand and standardize the collection of health\nequity data on a range of indicators, allowing more\neffective evaluation of strategies to reduce\ninequality\nInvesting in evidence-based interventions,\nincluding collaborating with states and specific\nstakeholders at the local level to evaluate effective\nstate-specific initiatives to improve health equity\nClosing gaps in coverage, access, and quality\nof care for Medicaid/CHIP-eligible individuals\nto help reduce barriers to coverage, encourage\nincreased access to continuous coverage for\nMedicaid and CHIP enrollees, and expand access\nto home- and community-based waiver and other\nprograms for underserved elderly and disabled\npopulations\nElevating the future of Medicaid | Connection, collaboration, and care 4Innovation and whole-person care\nCMCS’ third strategic priority centers on fostering state value-based care\ninnovations and treating both physical and behavioral health care needs of\nMedicaid beneficiaries.\nAs Medicaid and CHIP look into the future, value-based and\naccountable care will be important strategies to address the\nfull health care needs of the population. Recognizing that\nbehavioral health care needs to be addressed at parity—and\nwith similar intensity—as physical health requires fresh\napproaches to coverage and care. CMCS’ goals include:\nTransitioning most Medicaid\nbeneficiaries into accountable care\nentities by 2030—as many states are already\nbeginning to implement[3]—to help improve\nthe value of care provided and address the full\nrange of beneficiary health care needs\nProgressing toward more holistic, whole-\nperson care, including providing behavioral\nhealth and substance abuse services at the\nsame level and intensity as physical health\nservices\nContinuing use of Section 1115 waivers to\nhelp improve equity and financial\nsustainability among states, including\nexpanding access to care/coverage; improving\nquality of care; and innovating in the areas of\nvalue-based delivery and reimbursement\nElevating the future of Medicaid | Connection, collaboration, and care 5The Future of Medicaid\nWhat’s on the horizon for states?\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented tremendous challenges to Many states already are embracing opportunities to:\nstates managing their Medicaid programs—from rapidly\nincreasing enrollment to restricting some program reforms. Emphasize health equity principles\nMedicaid provided a valuable safety net to beneficiaries during throughout the Medicaid program, including\nthe PHE at a time when access and availability of health care improving data collection and reporting on quality\nwere paramount. and other measures, as well as directing managed\ncare organizations (MCOs) to improve the quality of\nOnce the PHE ends and states care for all beneficiaries, develop new equity\nstrategies, adopt innovative alternative payment\ncomplete the unwinding process\nmethods, and attract a more diverse agency\nfollowing the sunset of the Medicaid workforce\ncontinuous eligibility requirement,\nBuild on the expansions in coverage over the\nstates will have fresh opportunities to past decade by simplifying eligibility and enrollment\nto reduce churn and improve continuity of coverage\nleverage lessons learned since 2020\nIncrease focus on value-based care and\nand further improve their programs\neffectively integrating behavioral health care\naligned with CMCS’ vision. to improve the quality of care and access to\nservices across health care conditions\nElevating the future of Medicaid | Connection, collaboration, and care 6In future years, states will be challenged to continue existing efforts and develop new, innovative approaches to\naddress coverage/access and health equity needs—including providing value-based, whole-person care. The levers\nand strategies vary by program, but the overarching goals are largely consistent across states.\nMedicaid programs continue to build toward the future—from policy and operations to supporting technologies to\nmodernize their programs.\nPolicy and operational enhancements are vital to states to effectively\nmanage their Medicaid programs, and states are pursuing numerous\ngoals, including:\n Using Section 1115 waivers to advance equity and other programmatic\ngoals by funding community partners, expanding eligibility, and addressing\nnon-medical drivers of health\n Strengthening network adequacy standards, including those for behavioral\nhealth, to improve access to care and service delivery\n Adopting administrative simplifications, such as Express Lane or facilitated\nenrollment flexibilities, to improve the redetermination process and confirm\nthat those eligible for coverage stay enrolled\n Continuing to bolster data collection and reporting for Healthcare\nEffectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Medicaid & CHIP Core\nSet measures to evaluate overall quality of care as well as specific areas of\ninequity\n Considering transitions to accountable care entities and other value-based\nmodels that reimburse for the total set of services needed to address the\nfull range of beneficiary health care needs\n Pursuing value-based payment models and other innovative\nreimbursement strategies, which may be effective to reward providers and\nMCOs for improved quality of care and outcomes\nTechnological improvements are helping to propel states to improve\naccess to care and services, including:\n Continued expansion of telehealth services to provide additional equitable\naccess to whole-person care for beneficiaries, especially in rural or\nunderserved communities\n Modernization of eligibility and enrollment systems and Medicaid enterprise\nsystems to support continuous coverage for eligible beneficiaries; better\nmanage claims/encounters and other administrative functions; and\ncomprehensively collect, store, share, and apply data and programmatic\ninformation\n Employing smart technologies such as machine learning and geographic\ninformation systems (GIS) to enhance and modernize program operations,\ncustomer service, targeted interventions, and other aspects of the Medicaid\nprogram\nElevating the future of Medicaid | Connection, collaboration, and care 7In conclusion\nThe future of Medicaid will not be without\nunexpected challenges and obstacles. Within the\nMedicaid state-federal collaboration, there is broad\nconsensus towards innovation and continued\nimprovement to serve the Medicaid population.\nWant to learn more about the future of Medicaid?
