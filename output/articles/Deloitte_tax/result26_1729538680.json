This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Convention, income or gains derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income or gain is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income or gain of a resident of that State.\n\n3. This Convention shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents except with respect to the benefits granted under paragraph 3 of Article 7, paragraph 2 of Article 9, paragraph 2 of Article 17 and Articles 18, 19, 22, 23, 24 and 27.\n\nArticle 2: Taxes covered\n1. This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and on capital imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local authorities, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied.\n\n2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income and on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital, or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property.\n\n3. The existing taxes to which the Convention shall apply are in particular:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) the income tax;\n\n(ii) the corporation tax; and\n\n(iii)the capital gains tax\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “United Kingdom tax”);\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) the income tax on individuals (l’impôt sur le revenu des personnes physiques);\n\n(ii) the corporation tax (l’impôt sur le revenu des collectivités)\n\n(iii) the capital tax (l’impôt sur la fortune); and\n\n(iv) the communal trade tax (l’impôt commercial communal)\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “Luxembourg tax”).\n\n4. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws.\n\nArticle 3: General definitions\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na) the term “United Kingdom” means Great Britain and Northern Ireland but, when used in a geographical sense, means the territory and territorial sea of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the areas beyond that territorial sea over which Great Britain and Northern Ireland exercise sovereign rights or jurisdiction in accordance with their domestic law and international law;\n\nb) the term “Luxembourg” means the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and, when used in a geographical sense, means the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;\n\nc) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean the United Kingdom or Luxembourg, as the context requires;\n\nd) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons;\n\ne) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes;\n\nf) the term “enterprise” applies to the carrying on of any business;\n\ng) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State;\n\nh) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in a Contracting State and the enterprise that operates the ship or aircraft is not an enterprise of that State;\n\ni) the term “competent authority” means:\n\n(i) in the United Kingdom, the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs or their authorised representative;\n\n(ii) in Luxembourg, the Minister of Finance or his authorised representative;\n\nj) the term “national” means:\n\n(i) in relation to the United Kingdom, any British citizen, or any British subject not possessing the citizenship of any other Commonwealth country or territory, provided he has the right of abode in the United Kingdom; and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in the United Kingdom;\n\n(ii) in relation to Luxembourg,\n\n(a) any individual possessing the nationality of Luxembourg;\n\n(b) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in Luxembourg;\n\nk) the term “business” includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character;\n\nl) the term “recognised pension fund” of a State means an entity or arrangement established in that State that is treated as a separate person under the taxation laws of that State and:\n\n(i) that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to administer or provide retirement benefits and ancillary or incidental benefits to individuals and that is regulated as such by that State or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities; or\n\n(ii) that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to invest funds for the benefit of entities or arrangements referred to in subdivision (i).\n\nWhere an arrangement established in a Contracting State would constitute a recognised pension fund under subdivision (i) or (ii) if it were treated as a separate person under the taxation law of that State, it shall be considered, for the purposes of this Convention, as a separate person treated as such under the taxation law of that State and all the assets, income and gains to which the arrangement applies shall be treated as assets held and income or gains derived by that separate person and not by another person.\n\n2. As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the competent authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 24, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which this Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State.\n\nArticle 4: Resident\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management, place of incorporation, place of registered office or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof, as well as a recognised pension fund of that State. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income or capital gains from sources in that State or capital situated therein.\n\n2. The term “resident of a Contracting State” includes an organisation that is established and is operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, cultural or educational purposes (or for more than one of those purposes) and that is a resident of that State according to its laws, notwithstanding that all or part of its income or gains may be exempt from tax under the domestic law of that State.\n\n3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:\n\na) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests);\n\nb) if the Contracting State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he does not have a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode;\n\nc) if he has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national;\n\nd) if he is a national of both Contracting States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.\n\n4. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Convention, except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States.\n\nArticle 5: Permanent establishment\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.\n\n2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially:\n\na) a place of management;\n\nb) a branch;\n\nc) an office;\n\nd) a factory;\n\ne) a workshop; and\n\nf) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources.\n\n3. A building site, a construction, installation or dredging project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than twelve months.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:\n\na) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;\n\nb) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;\n\nc) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;\n\nd) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;\n\ne) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;\n\nf) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.\n\n5. Paragraph 4 shall not apply to a fixed place of business that is used or maintained by an enterprise if the same enterprise or a closely related enterprise carries on business activities at the same place or at another place in the same Contracting State and\n\na) that place or other place constitutes a permanent establishment for the enterprise or the closely related enterprise under the provisions of this Article, or\n\nb) the overall activity resulting from the combination of the activities carried on by the two enterprises at the same place, or by the same enterprise or closely related enterprises at the two places, is not of a preparatory or auxiliary character,\n\nprovided that the business activities carried on by the two enterprises at the same place, or by the same enterprise or closely related enterprises at the two places, constitute complementary functions that are part of a cohesive business operation.\n\n6. For the purposes of paragraph 5, an enterprise is closely related to an enterprise if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same persons or enterprises. In any case, an enterprise shall be considered to be closely related to an enterprise if one possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) or if another person or enterprise possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) in the person and the enterprise or in the two enterprises.\n\n7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business (other than a fixed place of business to which paragraph 5 would apply), would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.\n\n8. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.\n\n9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.\n\nArticle 6: Income from immovable property\n1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.\n\n4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise.\n\nArticle 7: Business profits\n1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Article and Article 22, the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.\n\n3. Where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, the other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged on those profits. In determining such adjustment, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.\n\n4. Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.\n\nArticle 8: International shipping and air transport\n1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include:\n\na) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft; and\n\nb) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise;\n\nwhere such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency, but only to so much of the profits so derived as is attributable to the participant in proportion to its share in the joint operation.\n\nArticle 9: Associated enterprises\n1. Where\n\na) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or\n\nb) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,\n\nand in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.\n\n2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.\n\nArticle 10: Dividends\n1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. However, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State may also be taxed in that State according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State:\n\na) except as provided in sub-paragraph b), such dividends shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident;\n\nb) where dividends are paid out of income (including gains) derived directly or indirectly from immovable property within the meaning of Article 6 by an investment vehicle which distributes most of this income annually and whose income from such immovable property is exempted from tax, the tax charged by the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends other than where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a recognised pension fund established in the other Contracting State, where the exemption provided in sub-paragraph a) shall apply.\n\nThis paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.\n\n3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as any other item which is treated as income from shares by the taxation laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.\n\n4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.\n\nArticle 11: Interest\n1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State.\n\n2. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. Income which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 and penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 12: Royalties\n1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State.\n\n2. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information (know-how) concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 13: Capital gains\n1. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or comparable interests, such as interests in a partnership or trust, deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property, as defined in Article 6, situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n3. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State.\n\n4. Gains that an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates ships or aircraft in international traffic derives from the alienation of such ships or aircraft, or of movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.\n\n5. Gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.\n\n6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, gains derived by a resident of Luxembourg from the alienation of rights to assets to be produced by the exploration or exploitation of the seabed and its sub-soil situated in the United Kingdom, under the authority of a licence granted by the United Kingdom, including rights to interests in or to the benefit of such assets or from the alienation of shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from such rights, may be taxed in the United Kingdom.\n\nArticle 14: Income from employment\n1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:\n\na) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned; and\n\nb) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and\n\nc) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment, as a member of the regular complement of a ship or aircraft, that is exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic, other than aboard a ship or aircraft operated solely within the other Contracting State, shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State. Where, however, the ship or aircraft is operated by an enterprise of the other Contracting State, such remuneration may also be taxed in the other State.\n\nArticle 15: Directors’ fees\nDirectors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\nArticle 16: Entertainers and sportspersons\n1.

Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson acting as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.\n\nArticle 17: Pensions\n1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 18, pensions and other similar remuneration arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first-mentioned State.\n\n2.

Items of income beneficially owned by a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, which are not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, where an amount of income is paid to a resident of a Contracting State out of income received by trustees or personal representatives administering the estates of deceased persons and those trustees or personal representatives are residents of the other Contracting State, that amount shall be treated as arising from the same sources, and in the same proportions, as the income received by the trustees or personal representatives out of which that amount is paid.\n\nAny tax paid by the trustees or personal representatives in respect of the income paid to the beneficiary shall be treated as if it had been paid by the beneficiary.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the beneficial owner of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the resident referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and some other person, or between both of them and some third person, the amount of the income referred to in that paragraph exceeds the amount (if any) which would have been agreed upon between them in the absence of such a relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the income shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other applicable provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 21: Capital\n1. Capital represented by immovable property referred to in Article 6, owned by a resident of a Contracting State and situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Capital represented by movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n3. Capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates ships or aircraft in international traffic represented by such ships or aircraft, and by movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.\n\n4. All other elements of capital of a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State.\n\nArticle 22: Elimination of double taxation\n1. Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom or, as the case may be, regarding the exemption from United Kingdom tax of a dividend arising in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):\n\na) Luxembourg tax payable under the laws of Luxembourg and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within Luxembourg (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Luxembourg tax is computed;\n\nb) a dividend which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;\n\nc) the profits of a permanent establishment in Luxembourg of a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;\n\nd) in the case of a dividend not exempted from tax under sub-paragraph b) above which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above shall take into account the Luxembourg tax payable by the company in respect of the profits in respect of which such dividend is paid.\n\n2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply where the Luxembourg tax payable is in accordance with the provisions of this Convention solely because the income, profits or chargeable gains referred to in that paragraph is also income derived by a resident of Luxembourg.\n\n3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, profits, income and capital gains owned by a resident of the United Kingdom which may be taxed in Luxembourg in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in Luxembourg.\n\n4. Subject to the provisions of the law of Luxembourg regarding the elimination of double taxation which shall not affect the general principle hereof, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows:\n\na) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall, subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs b) and c), exempt such income or capital from tax, but may, in order to calculate the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of the resident, apply the same rates of tax as if the income or capital had not been exempted.\n\nb) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 13, paragraph 3 of Article 14, Article 16 or Article 20, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall allow as a deduction from the income tax on individuals or from the corporation tax of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the United Kingdom. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income derived from the United Kingdom.\n\nc) The provisions of sub-paragraph a) shall not apply to income derived or capital owned by a resident of Luxembourg where the United Kingdom applies the provisions of this Convention to exempt such income or capital from tax or applies the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10 to such income.\n\nArticle 23: Non-discrimination\n1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.\n\n2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.\n\n3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 4 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, or paragraph 4 of Article 20 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.\n\n4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.\n\n5. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident or to its nationals.\n\n6. The provisions of this Article shall apply to the taxes which are the subject of this Convention.\n\nArticle 24: Mutual agreement procedure\n1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of either Contracting State. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.\n\n2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.\n\n3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.\n\n4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.\n\n5. Where,\n\na) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and\n\nb) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the date when all the information required by the competent authorities in order to address the case has been provided to both competent authorities,\n\nany unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.\n\nArticle 25: Exchange of information\n1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.\n\n2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.\n\n3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:\n\na) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nb) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nc) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).\n\n4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.\n\n5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.\n\nArticle 26: Assistance in the collection of taxes\n1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Article 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.\n\n2. The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes covered by the Convention together with interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.\n\n3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.\n\n4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.\n\n6. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State.\n\n7. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be:\n\na) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or\n\nb) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection\n\nthe competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.\n\n8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:\n\na) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nb) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy;\n\nc) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice;\n\nd) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State;\n\ne) to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.\n\nArticle 27: Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts\nNothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic or permanent missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.\n\nArticle 28: Entitlement to benefits\n1. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n2. Where a benefit under this Convention is denied to a person under paragraph 1, the competent authority of the Contracting State that would otherwise have granted this benefit shall nevertheless treat that person as being entitled to this benefit, or to different benefits with respect to a specific item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if such competent authority, upon request from that person and after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, determines that such benefits would have been granted to that person in the absence of the transaction or arrangement referred to in paragraph 1. The competent authority of the Contracting State to which the request has been made will consult with the competent authority of the other State before rejecting a request made under this paragraph by a resident of that other State.\n\nArticle 29: Entry into force\n1. The Contracting States shall notify each other in writing, through diplomatic channels, that the procedures required by its law for the entry into force of this Convention have been satisfied. This Convention shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the later notification and shall thereupon have effect:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\n(ii) in respect of income tax and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\n(iii) in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 April of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force;\n\n(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, and taxes on capital, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force.\n\n2. The Convention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed at London on 24 May 1967 as amended by the first Protocol signed at London on 18 July 1978, the second Protocol signed at London on 28 January 1983, and the third Protocol and accompanying exchange of letters signed at London on 2 July 2009 (the “prior Convention”) shall cease to have effect in respect of any tax with effect from the date upon which this Convention has effect in respect of that tax in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, the provisions of Article 24 (Mutual agreement procedure) and Article 25 (Exchange of information) shall have effect from the date of entry into force of this Convention without regard to the taxable period to which the matter relates, subject, in the case of Article 25, to the condition that the information could have been supplied under the provisions of the prior Convention.\n\n4. In respect of the development land tax and the petroleum revenue tax to which the prior Convention applies, the prior Convention shall cease to be effective from the date upon which this Convention enters into force.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 and the provisions of Article 17 and paragraph 2 of Article 18, where, immediately before the entry into force of this Convention, an individual was in receipt of payments falling within paragraph 1 of Article XVIII or a pension falling within Article XIX of the prior Convention or a pension falling within Article XXII of the prior Convention and, but for the provisions of this paragraph, those payments or pensions would fall within Articles 17 or 18 of this Convention, that individual may make an irrevocable election within a period of three years from the date of entry into force of this Convention that the above-mentioned provisions of the prior Convention shall continue to apply to those payments.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, an individual who is entitled to the benefits of Article XX of the prior Convention at the time of the entry into force of this Convention shall continue to be entitled to such benefits as if the prior Convention had remained in force.\n\n7. The prior Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with this Article.\n\nArticle 30: Termination\nThis Convention shall remain in force until terminated by one of the Contracting States. Either Contracting State may terminate this Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force of this Convention. In such event, this Convention shall cease to have effect:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited after the date that is six months after the date on which notice of termination was given;\n\n(ii) in respect of income tax and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April next following the date on which the notice is given;\n\n(iii) in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the notice is given.\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given;\n\n(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, and taxes on capital, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given.\n\nIn witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Convention.\n\nDone in duplicate at London this seventh day of June 2022 in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authoritative\n\nProtocol\nAt the moment of signing the Convention for the Elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital and the Prevention of Tax Avoidance and Evasion, this day concluded between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Convention.\n\n1. With reference to sub-paragraph l) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 (General definitions) and sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Dividends):\n\nIt is understood that the term “recognised pension fund” includes:\n\na) in the case of Luxembourg:\n\n(i) Pension-savings companies with variable capital (sociétés d’épargne-pension à capital variable: SEPCAV);\n\n(ii) Pension-savings associations (associations d’épargne-pension: ASSEP);\n\n(iii) Pension funds subject to supervision and regulation by the Insurance Commissioner (Commissariat aux assurances); and\n\n(iv) the Social Security Compensation Fund (Fonds de Compensation de la Sécurité Sociale) SICAV-FIS;\n\nb) in the case of the United Kingdom, pension schemes (other than a social security scheme) registered under Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004, including pension funds or pension schemes arranged through insurance companies and unit trusts where the unit holders are exclusively pension schemes.\n\nThe competent authorities may agree to include in the above, pension schemes of identical or substantially similar economic or legal nature which are introduced by way of statute or legislation in either State after the date of signature of the Convention.\n\n2. With reference to Article 4 (Resident):\n\na) It is understood that a collective investment vehicle, which is established and treated as a body corporate for tax purposes in Luxembourg and which receives income arising in the United Kingdom shall be treated for purposes of applying the Convention to such income as an individual who is a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof), but only to the extent that the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries. However, if at least 75 per cent of the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries, or if the collective investment vehicle is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/65, the collective investment vehicle shall be treated as a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of all of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof).\n\nb) For the purposes of this paragraph the term “equivalent beneficiary” means a resident of Luxembourg, and a resident of any other jurisdiction with which the United Kingdom has arrangements that provide for effective and comprehensive information exchange who would, if he received the particular item of income for which benefits are being claimed under this Convention, be entitled under an income tax convention with the United Kingdom, to a rate of tax with respect to that item of income that is at least as low as the rate claimed under this Convention by the collective investment vehicle with respect to that item of income.\n\nc) For the purposes of this paragraph of this Protocol, the term “collective investment vehicle” means:\n\n(i) Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) subject to Part I of the law of 17 December 2010;\n\n(ii) Undertakings for Collective Investment subject to Part II of the law of 17 December 2010;\n\n(iii) Specialised Investment Funds (SIF) subject to the law of 13 February 2007; and\n\n(iv) Reserved Alternative Investment Funds (RAIF) subject to the law of 23 July 2016, with the exception of reserved alternative investment funds which choose to subject themselves to the regime of Article 48 of the said law,\n\nas well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in Luxembourg which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle.\n\n3. With reference to paragraph 4 of Article 4 (Resident):\n\nIt is understood that in applying this provision, the competent authorities shall have regard to:\n\ni) where the senior management of the person is carried on;\n\nii) where the meetings of the board of directors or equivalent body are held;\n\niii) where the person’s headquarters are located;\n\niv) the extent and nature of the economic nexus of the person to each State; and\n\nv) whether determining that the person is a resident of one of the Contracting States but not of the other State for the purposes of the Convention would carry the risk of an improper use of the Convention or inappropriate application of the domestic law of either State.\n\nThis list of factors is not exhaustive. The competent authorities will apply the provision on a case by case basis. As the facts upon which an agreement is reached may change over time the competent authorities may revisit agreements, particularly where there are significant changes in the relevant facts.\n\nWhere a company was resident in both Luxembourg and the United Kingdom under the domestic law of those countries before the entry into force of this Convention, and the status of that company was determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article IV of the prior Convention, the competent authorities of Luxembourg and the United Kingdom will not seek to revisit that determination so long as all the material facts remain the same. Where the material facts change after the entry into force of this Convention, and the competent authorities determine that for treaty purposes the company should be regarded as a resident of the other State (or the competent authorities do not reach a mutual agreement), that new determination (or the loss of treaty benefits pursuant to the absence of a mutual agreement) will apply only to income or gains arising after the new determination (or notice to the taxpayer of the absence of an agreement).\n\n4. With reference to Articles 10 (Dividends) and 11 (Interest):\n\nIt is understood that an authorised representative of an investment fund established in a Contracting State may submit a claim relating to the benefits afforded by the provisions of these Articles. The competent authorities may consult together with a view to putting arrangements in place which facilitate claims and resolving any doubts concerning eligibility.\n\n5. It is understood that:\n\nNothing in this Convention shall prevent Luxembourg from applying the provisions of Article 164ter of the income tax law or any other similar provision that amends or replaces the above-mentioned Article.\n\nIn witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.\n\nDone in duplicate at London this seventh day of June 2022 in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authoritative\">\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"International treaty\n2022 UK-Luxembourg Double Taxation Convention and protocol — in force\nUpdated 8 December 2023\n\nContents\nConvention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital, and the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance\nArticle 1: Persons covered\nArticle 2: Taxes covered\nArticle 3: General definitions\nArticle 4: Resident\nArticle 5: Permanent establishment\nArticle 6: Income from immovable property\nArticle 7: Business profits\nArticle 8: International shipping and air transport\nArticle 9: Associated enterprises\nArticle 10: Dividends\nArticle 11: Interest\nArticle 12: Royalties\nArticle 13: Capital gains\nArticle 14: Income from employment\nArticle 15: Directors’ fees\nArticle 16: Entertainers and sportspersons\nArticle 17: Pensions\nArticle 18: Government service\nArticle 19: Students\nArticle 20: Other income\nArticle 21: Capital\nArticle 22: Elimination of double taxation\nArticle 23: Non-discrimination\nArticle 24: Mutual agreement procedure\nArticle 25: Exchange of information\nArticle 26: Assistance in the collection of taxes\nArticle 27: Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts\nArticle 28: Entitlement to benefits\nArticle 29: Entry into force\nArticle 30: Termination\nProtocol\nPrint this page\nConvention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital, and the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance\nThe Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;\n\nDesiring to further develop their economic relationship and to enhance their cooperation in tax matters;\n\nIntending to conclude a Convention for the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this Convention for the indirect benefit of residents of third States);\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\nArticle 1: Persons covered\n1. This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Convention, income or gains derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income or gain is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income or gain of a resident of that State.\n\n3. This Convention shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents except with respect to the benefits granted under paragraph 3 of Article 7, paragraph 2 of Article 9, paragraph 2 of Article 17 and Articles 18, 19, 22, 23, 24 and 27.\n\nArticle 2: Taxes covered\n1. This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and on capital imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local authorities, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied.\n\n2.

For the purposes of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na) the term “United Kingdom” means Great Britain and Northern Ireland but, when used in a geographical sense, means the territory and territorial sea of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the areas beyond that territorial sea over which Great Britain and Northern Ireland exercise sovereign rights or jurisdiction in accordance with their domestic law and international law;\n\nb) the term “Luxembourg” means the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and, when used in a geographical sense, means the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;\n\nc) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean the United Kingdom or Luxembourg, as the context requires;\n\nd) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons;\n\ne) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes;\n\nf) the term “enterprise” applies to the carrying on of any business;\n\ng) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State;\n\nh) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in a Contracting State and the enterprise that operates the ship or aircraft is not an enterprise of that State;\n\ni) the term “competent authority” means:\n\n(i) in the United Kingdom, the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs or their authorised representative;\n\n(ii) in Luxembourg, the Minister of Finance or his authorised representative;\n\nj) the term “national” means:\n\n(i) in relation to the United Kingdom, any British citizen, or any British subject not possessing the citizenship of any other Commonwealth country or territory, provided he has the right of abode in the United Kingdom; and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in the United Kingdom;\n\n(ii) in relation to Luxembourg,\n\n(a) any individual possessing the nationality of Luxembourg;\n\n(b) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in Luxembourg;\n\nk) the term “business” includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character;\n\nl) the term “recognised pension fund” of a State means an entity or arrangement established in that State that is treated as a separate person under the taxation laws of that State and:\n\n(i) that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to administer or provide retirement benefits and ancillary or incidental benefits to individuals and that is regulated as such by that State or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities; or\n\n(ii) that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to invest funds for the benefit of entities or arrangements referred to in subdivision (i).\n\nWhere an arrangement established in a Contracting State would constitute a recognised pension fund under subdivision (i) or (ii) if it were treated as a separate person under the taxation law of that State, it shall be considered, for the purposes of this Convention, as a separate person treated as such under the taxation law of that State and all the assets, income and gains to which the arrangement applies shall be treated as assets held and income or gains derived by that separate person and not by another person.\n\n2. As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the competent authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 24, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which this Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State.\n\nArticle 4: Resident\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management, place of incorporation, place of registered office or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof, as well as a recognised pension fund of that State. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income or capital gains from sources in that State or capital situated therein.\n\n2. The term “resident of a Contracting State” includes an organisation that is established and is operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, cultural or educational purposes (or for more than one of those purposes) and that is a resident of that State according to its laws, notwithstanding that all or part of its income or gains may be exempt from tax under the domestic law of that State.\n\n3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:\n\na) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests);\n\nb) if the Contracting State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he does not have a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode;\n\nc) if he has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national;\n\nd) if he is a national of both Contracting States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.\n\n4. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Convention, except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States.\n\nArticle 5: Permanent establishment\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.\n\n2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially:\n\na) a place of management;\n\nb) a branch;\n\nc) an office;\n\nd) a factory;\n\ne) a workshop; and\n\nf) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources.\n\n3. A building site, a construction, installation or dredging project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than twelve months.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:\n\na) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;\n\nb) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;\n\nc) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;\n\nd) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;\n\ne) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;\n\nf) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.\n\n5. Paragraph 4 shall not apply to a fixed place of business that is used or maintained by an enterprise if the same enterprise or a closely related enterprise carries on business activities at the same place or at another place in the same Contracting State and\n\na) that place or other place constitutes a permanent establishment for the enterprise or the closely related enterprise under the provisions of this Article, or\n\nb) the overall activity resulting from the combination of the activities carried on by the two enterprises at the same place, or by the same enterprise or closely related enterprises at the two places, is not of a preparatory or auxiliary character,\n\nprovided that the business activities carried on by the two enterprises at the same place, or by the same enterprise or closely related enterprises at the two places, constitute complementary functions that are part of a cohesive business operation.\n\n6. For the purposes of paragraph 5, an enterprise is closely related to an enterprise if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same persons or enterprises. In any case, an enterprise shall be considered to be closely related to an enterprise if one possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) or if another person or enterprise possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) in the person and the enterprise or in the two enterprises.\n\n7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business (other than a fixed place of business to which paragraph 5 would apply), would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.\n\n8. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.\n\n9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.\n\nArticle 6: Income from immovable property\n1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.\n\n4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise.\n\nArticle 7: Business profits\n1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Article and Article 22, the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.\n\n3. Where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, the other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged on those profits. In determining such adjustment, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.\n\n4. Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.\n\nArticle 8: International shipping and air transport\n1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include:\n\na) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft; and\n\nb) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise;\n\nwhere such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency, but only to so much of the profits so derived as is attributable to the participant in proportion to its share in the joint operation.\n\nArticle 9: Associated enterprises\n1. Where\n\na) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or\n\nb) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,\n\nand in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.\n\n2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.\n\nArticle 10: Dividends\n1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. However, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State may also be taxed in that State according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State:\n\na) except as provided in sub-paragraph b), such dividends shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident;\n\nb) where dividends are paid out of income (including gains) derived directly or indirectly from immovable property within the meaning of Article 6 by an investment vehicle which distributes most of this income annually and whose income from such immovable property is exempted from tax, the tax charged by the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends other than where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a recognised pension fund established in the other Contracting State, where the exemption provided in sub-paragraph a) shall apply.\n\nThis paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.\n\n3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as any other item which is treated as income from shares by the taxation laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.\n\n4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.\n\nArticle 11: Interest\n1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State.\n\n2. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. Income which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 and penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 12: Royalties\n1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State.\n\n2. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information (know-how) concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 13: Capital gains\n1. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or comparable interests, such as interests in a partnership or trust, deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property, as defined in Article 6, situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n3. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State.\n\n4. Gains that an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates ships or aircraft in international traffic derives from the alienation of such ships or aircraft, or of movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.\n\n5. Gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.\n\n6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, gains derived by a resident of Luxembourg from the alienation of rights to assets to be produced by the exploration or exploitation of the seabed and its sub-soil situated in the United Kingdom, under the authority of a licence granted by the United Kingdom, including rights to interests in or to the benefit of such assets or from the alienation of shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from such rights, may be taxed in the United Kingdom.\n\nArticle 14: Income from employment\n1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:\n\na) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned; and\n\nb) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and\n\nc) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment, as a member of the regular complement of a ship or aircraft, that is exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic, other than aboard a ship or aircraft operated solely within the other Contracting State, shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State. Where, however, the ship or aircraft is operated by an enterprise of the other Contracting State, such remuneration may also be taxed in the other State.\n\nArticle 15: Directors’ fees\nDirectors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\nArticle 16: Entertainers and sportspersons\n1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that resident’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson acting as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.\n\nArticle 17: Pensions\n1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 18, pensions and other similar remuneration arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first-mentioned State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, pensions and other similar remuneration (including lump-sum payments) arising in Luxembourg and paid to a resident of the United Kingdom shall be taxable only in Luxembourg, provided that such payments derive from contributions paid to or from provisions made under a complementary pension scheme by the recipient or on his behalf and to the extent that these contributions, provisions, or the pensions or other similar remuneration have been subjected to tax in Luxembourg under the ordinary rules of its tax laws.\n\nArticle 18: Government service\n1. a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.\n\nb) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who:\n\n(i) is a national of that State; or\n\n(ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services\n\nand is subject to tax in that State on such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration.\n\n2. a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, pensions and other similar remuneration paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.\n\nb) However, such pensions and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State.\n\n3.

Items of income beneficially owned by a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, which are not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, where an amount of income is paid to a resident of a Contracting State out of income received by trustees or personal representatives administering the estates of deceased persons and those trustees or personal representatives are residents of the other Contracting State, that amount shall be treated as arising from the same sources, and in the same proportions, as the income received by the trustees or personal representatives out of which that amount is paid.\n\nAny tax paid by the trustees or personal representatives in respect of the income paid to the beneficiary shall be treated as if it had been paid by the beneficiary.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the beneficial owner of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the resident referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and some other person, or between both of them and some third person, the amount of the income referred to in that paragraph exceeds the amount (if any) which would have been agreed upon between them in the absence of such a relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the income shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other applicable provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 21: Capital\n1.

Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom or, as the case may be, regarding the exemption from United Kingdom tax of a dividend arising in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):\n\na) Luxembourg tax payable under the laws of Luxembourg and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within Luxembourg (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Luxembourg tax is computed;\n\nb) a dividend which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;\n\nc) the profits of a permanent establishment in Luxembourg of a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;\n\nd) in the case of a dividend not exempted from tax under sub-paragraph b) above which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above shall take into account the Luxembourg tax payable by the company in respect of the profits in respect of which such dividend is paid.\n\n2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply where the Luxembourg tax payable is in accordance with the provisions of this Convention solely because the income, profits or chargeable gains referred to in that paragraph is also income derived by a resident of Luxembourg.\n\n3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, profits, income and capital gains owned by a resident of the United Kingdom which may be taxed in Luxembourg in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in Luxembourg.\n\n4. Subject to the provisions of the law of Luxembourg regarding the elimination of double taxation which shall not affect the general principle hereof, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows:\n\na) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall, subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs b) and c), exempt such income or capital from tax, but may, in order to calculate the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of the resident, apply the same rates of tax as if the income or capital had not been exempted.\n\nb) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 13, paragraph 3 of Article 14, Article 16 or Article 20, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall allow as a deduction from the income tax on individuals or from the corporation tax of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the United Kingdom. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income derived from the United Kingdom.\n\nc) The provisions of sub-paragraph a) shall not apply to income derived or capital owned by a resident of Luxembourg where the United Kingdom applies the provisions of this Convention to exempt such income or capital from tax or applies the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10 to such income.\n\nArticle 23: Non-discrimination\n1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.\n\n2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.\n\n3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 4 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, or paragraph 4 of Article 20 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.\n\n4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.\n\n5. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident or to its nationals.\n\n6. The provisions of this Article shall apply to the taxes which are the subject of this Convention.\n\nArticle 24: Mutual agreement procedure\n1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of either Contracting State. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.\n\n2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.\n\n3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.\n\n4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.\n\n5. Where,\n\na) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and\n\nb) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the date when all the information required by the competent authorities in order to address the case has been provided to both competent authorities,\n\nany unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.\n\nArticle 25: Exchange of information\n1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.\n\n2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.\n\n3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:\n\na) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nb) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nc) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).\n\n4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.\n\n5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.\n\nArticle 26: Assistance in the collection of taxes\n1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Article 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.\n\n2. The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes covered by the Convention together with interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.\n\n3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.\n\n4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.\n\n6. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State.\n\n7. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be:\n\na) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or\n\nb) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection\n\nthe competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.\n\n8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:\n\na) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nb) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy;\n\nc) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice;\n\nd) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State;\n\ne) to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.\n\nArticle 27: Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts\nNothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic or permanent missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.\n\nArticle 28: Entitlement to benefits\n1. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n2. Where a benefit under this Convention is denied to a person under paragraph 1, the competent authority of the Contracting State that would otherwise have granted this benefit shall nevertheless treat that person as being entitled to this benefit, or to different benefits with respect to a specific item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if such competent authority, upon request from that person and after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, determines that such benefits would have been granted to that person in the absence of the transaction or arrangement referred to in paragraph 1. The competent authority of the Contracting State to which the request has been made will consult with the competent authority of the other State before rejecting a request made under this paragraph by a resident of that other State.\n\nArticle 29: Entry into force\n1. The Contracting States shall notify each other in writing, through diplomatic channels, that the procedures required by its law for the entry into force of this Convention have been satisfied. This Convention shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the later notification and shall thereupon have effect:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\n(ii) in respect of income tax and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\n(iii) in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 April of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force;\n\n(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, and taxes on capital, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force.\n\n2. The Convention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed at London on 24 May 1967 as amended by the first Protocol signed at London on 18 July 1978, the second Protocol signed at London on 28 January 1983, and the third Protocol and accompanying exchange of letters signed at London on 2 July 2009 (the “prior Convention”) shall cease to have effect in respect of any tax with effect from the date upon which this Convention has effect in respect of that tax in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, the provisions of Article 24 (Mutual agreement procedure) and Article 25 (Exchange of information) shall have effect from the date of entry into force of this Convention without regard to the taxable period to which the matter relates, subject, in the case of Article 25, to the condition that the information could have been supplied under the provisions of the prior Convention.\n\n4. In respect of the development land tax and the petroleum revenue tax to which the prior Convention applies, the prior Convention shall cease to be effective from the date upon which this Convention enters into force.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 and the provisions of Article 17 and paragraph 2 of Article 18, where, immediately before the entry into force of this Convention, an individual was in receipt of payments falling within paragraph 1 of Article XVIII or a pension falling within Article XIX of the prior Convention or a pension falling within Article XXII of the prior Convention and, but for the provisions of this paragraph, those payments or pensions would fall within Articles 17 or 18 of this Convention, that individual may make an irrevocable election within a period of three years from the date of entry into force of this Convention that the above-mentioned provisions of the prior Convention shall continue to apply to those payments.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, an individual who is entitled to the benefits of Article XX of the prior Convention at the time of the entry into force of this Convention shall continue to be entitled to such benefits as if the prior Convention had remained in force.\n\n7. The prior Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with this Article.\n\nArticle 30: Termination\nThis Convention shall remain in force until terminated by one of the Contracting States. Either Contracting State may terminate this Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force of this Convention. In such event, this Convention shall cease to have effect:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited after the date that is six months after the date on which notice of termination was given;\n\n(ii) in respect of income tax and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April next following the date on which the notice is given;\n\n(iii) in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the notice is given.\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given;\n\n(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, and taxes on capital, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given.\n\nIn witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Convention.\n\nDone in duplicate at London this seventh day of June 2022 in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authoritative\n\nProtocol\nAt the moment of signing the Convention for the Elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital and the Prevention of Tax Avoidance and Evasion, this day concluded between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Convention.\n\n1. With reference to sub-paragraph l) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 (General definitions) and sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Dividends):\n\nIt is understood that the term “recognised pension fund” includes:\n\na) in the case of Luxembourg:\n\n(i) Pension-savings companies with variable capital (sociétés d’épargne-pension à capital variable: SEPCAV);\n\n(ii) Pension-savings associations (associations d’épargne-pension: ASSEP);\n\n(iii) Pension funds subject to supervision and regulation by the Insurance Commissioner (Commissariat aux assurances); and\n\n(iv) the Social Security Compensation Fund (Fonds de Compensation de la Sécurité Sociale) SICAV-FIS;\n\nb) in the case of the United Kingdom, pension schemes (other than a social security scheme) registered under Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004, including pension funds or pension schemes arranged through insurance companies and unit trusts where the unit holders are exclusively pension schemes.\n\nThe competent authorities may agree to include in the above, pension schemes of identical or substantially similar economic or legal nature which are introduced by way of statute or legislation in either State after the date of signature of the Convention.\n\n2. With reference to Article 4 (Resident):\n\na) It is understood that a collective investment vehicle, which is established and treated as a body corporate for tax purposes in Luxembourg and which receives income arising in the United Kingdom shall be treated for purposes of applying the Convention to such income as an individual who is a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof), but only to the extent that the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries. However, if at least 75 per cent of the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries, or if the collective investment vehicle is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/65, the collective investment vehicle shall be treated as a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of all of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof).\n\nb) For the purposes of this paragraph the term “equivalent beneficiary” means a resident of Luxembourg, and a resident of any other jurisdiction with which the United Kingdom has arrangements that provide for effective and comprehensive information exchange who would, if he received the particular item of income for which benefits are being claimed under this Convention, be entitled under an income tax convention with the United Kingdom, to a rate of tax with respect to that item of income that is at least as low as the rate claimed under this Convention by the collective investment vehicle with respect to that item of income.\n\nc) For the purposes of this paragraph of this Protocol, the term “collective investment vehicle” means:\n\n(i) Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) subject to Part I of the law of 17 December 2010;\n\n(ii) Undertakings for Collective Investment subject to Part II of the law of 17 December 2010;\n\n(iii) Specialised Investment Funds (SIF) subject to the law of 13 February 2007; and\n\n(iv) Reserved Alternative Investment Funds (RAIF) subject to the law of 23 July 2016, with the exception of reserved alternative investment funds which choose to subject themselves to the regime of Article 48 of the said law,\n\nas well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in Luxembourg which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle.\n\n3. With reference to paragraph 4 of Article 4 (Resident):\n\nIt is understood that in applying this provision, the competent authorities shall have regard to:\n\ni) where the senior management of the person is carried on;\n\nii) where the meetings of the board of directors or equivalent body are held;\n\niii) where the person’s headquarters are located;\n\niv) the extent and nature of the economic nexus of the person to each State; and\n\nv) whether determining that the person is a resident of one of the Contracting States but not of the other State for the purposes of the Convention would carry the risk of an improper use of the Convention or inappropriate application of the domestic law of either State.\n\nThis list of factors is not exhaustive. The competent authorities will apply the provision on a case by case basis. As the facts upon which an agreement is reached may change over time the competent authorities may revisit agreements, particularly where there are significant changes in the relevant facts.\n\nWhere a company was resident in both Luxembourg and the United Kingdom under the domestic law of those countries before the entry into force of this Convention, and the status of that company was determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article IV of the prior Convention, the competent authorities of Luxembourg and the United Kingdom will not seek to revisit that determination so long as all the material facts remain the same. Where the material facts change after the entry into force of this Convention, and the competent authorities determine that for treaty purposes the company should be regarded as a resident of the other State (or the competent authorities do not reach a mutual agreement), that new determination (or the loss of treaty benefits pursuant to the absence of a mutual agreement) will apply only to income or gains arising after the new determination (or notice to the taxpayer of the absence of an agreement).\n\n4. With reference to Articles 10 (Dividends) and 11 (Interest):\n\nIt is understood that an authorised representative of an investment fund established in a Contracting State may submit a claim relating to the benefits afforded by the provisions of these Articles. The competent authorities may consult together with a view to putting arrangements in place which facilitate claims and resolving any doubts concerning eligibility.\n\n5. It is understood that:\n\nNothing in this Convention shall prevent Luxembourg from applying the provisions of Article 164ter of the income tax law or any other similar provision that amends or replaces the above-mentioned Article.\n\nIn witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.\n\nDone in duplicate at London this seventh day of June 2022 in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authoritative\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"International treaty\n2022 UK-Luxembourg Double Taxation Convention and protocol — in force\nUpdated 8 December 2023\n\nContents\nConvention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital, and the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance\nArticle 1: Persons covered\nArticle 2: Taxes covered\nArticle 3: General definitions\nArticle 4: Resident\nArticle 5: Permanent establishment\nArticle 6: Income from immovable property\nArticle 7: Business profits\nArticle 8: International shipping and air transport\nArticle 9: Associated enterprises\nArticle 10: Dividends\nArticle 11: Interest\nArticle 12: Royalties\nArticle 13: Capital gains\nArticle 14: Income from employment\nArticle 15: Directors’ fees\nArticle 16: Entertainers and sportspersons\nArticle 17: Pensions\nArticle 18: Government service\nArticle 19: Students\nArticle 20: Other income\nArticle 21: Capital\nArticle 22: Elimination of double taxation\nArticle 23: Non-discrimination\nArticle 24: Mutual agreement procedure\nArticle 25: Exchange of information\nArticle 26: Assistance in the collection of taxes\nArticle 27: Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts\nArticle 28: Entitlement to benefits\nArticle 29: Entry into force\nArticle 30: Termination\nProtocol\nPrint this page\nConvention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital, and the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance\nThe Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;\n\nDesiring to further develop their economic relationship and to enhance their cooperation in tax matters;\n\nIntending to conclude a Convention for the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this Convention for the indirect benefit of residents of third States);\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\nArticle 1: Persons covered\n1.

For the purposes of this Convention, income or gains derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income or gain is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income or gain of a resident of that State.\n\n3. This Convention shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents except with respect to the benefits granted under paragraph 3 of Article 7, paragraph 2 of Article 9, paragraph 2 of Article 17 and Articles 18, 19, 22, 23, 24 and 27.\n\nArticle 2: Taxes covered\n1. This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and on capital imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local authorities, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied.\n\n2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income and on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital, or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property.\n\n3. The existing taxes to which the Convention shall apply are in particular:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) the income tax;\n\n(ii) the corporation tax; and\n\n(iii)the capital gains tax\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “United Kingdom tax”);\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) the income tax on individuals (l’impôt sur le revenu des personnes physiques);\n\n(ii) the corporation tax (l’impôt sur le revenu des collectivités)\n\n(iii) the capital tax (l’impôt sur la fortune); and\n\n(iv) the communal trade tax (l’impôt commercial communal)\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “Luxembourg tax”).\n\n4. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws.\n\nArticle 3: General definitions\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\na) the term “United Kingdom” means Great Britain and Northern Ireland but, when used in a geographical sense, means the territory and territorial sea of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the areas beyond that territorial sea over which Great Britain and Northern Ireland exercise sovereign rights or jurisdiction in accordance with their domestic law and international law;\n\nb) the term “Luxembourg” means the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and, when used in a geographical sense, means the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;\n\nc) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean the United Kingdom or Luxembourg, as the context requires;\n\nd) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons;\n\ne) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes;\n\nf) the term “enterprise” applies to the carrying on of any business;\n\ng) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State;\n\nh) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in a Contracting State and the enterprise that operates the ship or aircraft is not an enterprise of that State;\n\ni) the term “competent authority” means:\n\n(i) in the United Kingdom, the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs or their authorised representative;\n\n(ii) in Luxembourg, the Minister of Finance or his authorised representative;\n\nj) the term “national” means:\n\n(i) in relation to the United Kingdom, any British citizen, or any British subject not possessing the citizenship of any other Commonwealth country or territory, provided he has the right of abode in the United Kingdom; and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in the United Kingdom;\n\n(ii) in relation to Luxembourg,\n\n(a) any individual possessing the nationality of Luxembourg;\n\n(b) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in Luxembourg;\n\nk) the term “business” includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character;\n\nl) the term “recognised pension fund” of a State means an entity or arrangement established in that State that is treated as a separate person under the taxation laws of that State and:\n\n(i) that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to administer or provide retirement benefits and ancillary or incidental benefits to individuals and that is regulated as such by that State or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities; or\n\n(ii) that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to invest funds for the benefit of entities or arrangements referred to in subdivision (i).\n\nWhere an arrangement established in a Contracting State would constitute a recognised pension fund under subdivision (i) or (ii) if it were treated as a separate person under the taxation law of that State, it shall be considered, for the purposes of this Convention, as a separate person treated as such under the taxation law of that State and all the assets, income and gains to which the arrangement applies shall be treated as assets held and income or gains derived by that separate person and not by another person.\n\n2. As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the competent authorities agree to a different meaning pursuant to the provisions of Article 24, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which this Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State.\n\nArticle 4: Resident\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management, place of incorporation, place of registered office or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof, as well as a recognised pension fund of that State.

The term “resident of a Contracting State” includes an organisation that is established and is operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, cultural or educational purposes (or for more than one of those purposes) and that is a resident of that State according to its laws, notwithstanding that all or part of its income or gains may be exempt from tax under the domestic law of that State.\n\n3.

Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Convention, except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States.\n\nArticle 5: Permanent establishment\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.\n\n2.

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:\n\na) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;\n\nb) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;\n\nc) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;\n\nd) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;\n\ne) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;\n\nf) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.\n\n5. Paragraph 4 shall not apply to a fixed place of business that is used or maintained by an enterprise if the same enterprise or a closely related enterprise carries on business activities at the same place or at another place in the same Contracting State and\n\na) that place or other place constitutes a permanent establishment for the enterprise or the closely related enterprise under the provisions of this Article, or\n\nb) the overall activity resulting from the combination of the activities carried on by the two enterprises at the same place, or by the same enterprise or closely related enterprises at the two places, is not of a preparatory or auxiliary character,\n\nprovided that the business activities carried on by the two enterprises at the same place, or by the same enterprise or closely related enterprises at the two places, constitute complementary functions that are part of a cohesive business operation.\n\n6. For the purposes of paragraph 5, an enterprise is closely related to an enterprise if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same persons or enterprises. In any case, an enterprise shall be considered to be closely related to an enterprise if one possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) or if another person or enterprise possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) in the person and the enterprise or in the two enterprises.\n\n7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business (other than a fixed place of business to which paragraph 5 would apply), would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.\n\n8. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.\n\n9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.\n\nArticle 6: Income from immovable property\n1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.\n\n4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise.\n\nArticle 7: Business profits\n1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Article and Article 22, the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.\n\n3. Where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, the other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged on those profits. In determining such adjustment, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.\n\n4. Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.\n\nArticle 8: International shipping and air transport\n1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n2. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include:\n\na) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft; and\n\nb) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise;\n\nwhere such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency, but only to so much of the profits so derived as is attributable to the participant in proportion to its share in the joint operation.\n\nArticle 9: Associated enterprises\n1. Where\n\na) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or\n\nb) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,\n\nand in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.\n\n2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.\n\nArticle 10: Dividends\n1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. However, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State may also be taxed in that State according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State:\n\na) except as provided in sub-paragraph b), such dividends shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident;\n\nb) where dividends are paid out of income (including gains) derived directly or indirectly from immovable property within the meaning of Article 6 by an investment vehicle which distributes most of this income annually and whose income from such immovable property is exempted from tax, the tax charged by the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends other than where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a recognised pension fund established in the other Contracting State, where the exemption provided in sub-paragraph a) shall apply.\n\nThis paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.\n\n3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as any other item which is treated as income from shares by the taxation laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.\n\n4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.\n\nArticle 11: Interest\n1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State.\n\n2. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. Income which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 and penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 12: Royalties\n1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State.\n\n2.

The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 13: Capital gains\n1. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or comparable interests, such as interests in a partnership or trust, deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property, as defined in Article 6, situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n3. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State.\n\n4. Gains that an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates ships or aircraft in international traffic derives from the alienation of such ships or aircraft, or of movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.\n\n5.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, gains derived by a resident of Luxembourg from the alienation of rights to assets to be produced by the exploration or exploitation of the seabed and its sub-soil situated in the United Kingdom, under the authority of a licence granted by the United Kingdom, including rights to interests in or to the benefit of such assets or from the alienation of shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from such rights, may be taxed in the United Kingdom.\n\nArticle 14: Income from employment\n1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:\n\na) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned; and\n\nb) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and\n\nc) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment, as a member of the regular complement of a ship or aircraft, that is exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic, other than aboard a ship or aircraft operated solely within the other Contracting State, shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State. Where, however, the ship or aircraft is operated by an enterprise of the other Contracting State, such remuneration may also be taxed in the other State.\n\nArticle 15: Directors’ fees\nDirectors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\nArticle 16: Entertainers and sportspersons\n1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that resident’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson acting as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.\n\nArticle 17: Pensions\n1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 18, pensions and other similar remuneration arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first-mentioned State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, pensions and other similar remuneration (including lump-sum payments) arising in Luxembourg and paid to a resident of the United Kingdom shall be taxable only in Luxembourg, provided that such payments derive from contributions paid to or from provisions made under a complementary pension scheme by the recipient or on his behalf and to the extent that these contributions, provisions, or the pensions or other similar remuneration have been subjected to tax in Luxembourg under the ordinary rules of its tax laws.\n\nArticle 18: Government service\n1. a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.\n\nb) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who:\n\n(i) is a national of that State; or\n\n(ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services\n\nand is subject to tax in that State on such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration.\n\n2. a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, pensions and other similar remuneration paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.\n\nb) However, such pensions and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State.\n\n3.

Items of income beneficially owned by a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, which are not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, where an amount of income is paid to a resident of a Contracting State out of income received by trustees or personal representatives administering the estates of deceased persons and those trustees or personal representatives are residents of the other Contracting State, that amount shall be treated as arising from the same sources, and in the same proportions, as the income received by the trustees or personal representatives out of which that amount is paid.\n\nAny tax paid by the trustees or personal representatives in respect of the income paid to the beneficiary shall be treated as if it had been paid by the beneficiary.\n\n3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the beneficial owner of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.\n\n4. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the resident referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and some other person, or between both of them and some third person, the amount of the income referred to in that paragraph exceeds the amount (if any) which would have been agreed upon between them in the absence of such a relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the income shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other applicable provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle 21: Capital\n1.

Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom or, as the case may be, regarding the exemption from United Kingdom tax of a dividend arising in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):\n\na) Luxembourg tax payable under the laws of Luxembourg and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within Luxembourg (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Luxembourg tax is computed;\n\nb) a dividend which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;\n\nc) the profits of a permanent establishment in Luxembourg of a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;\n\nd) in the case of a dividend not exempted from tax under sub-paragraph b) above which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above shall take into account the Luxembourg tax payable by the company in respect of the profits in respect of which such dividend is paid.\n\n2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply where the Luxembourg tax payable is in accordance with the provisions of this Convention solely because the income, profits or chargeable gains referred to in that paragraph is also income derived by a resident of Luxembourg.\n\n3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, profits, income and capital gains owned by a resident of the United Kingdom which may be taxed in Luxembourg in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in Luxembourg.\n\n4. Subject to the provisions of the law of Luxembourg regarding the elimination of double taxation which shall not affect the general principle hereof, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows:\n\na) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall, subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs b) and c), exempt such income or capital from tax, but may, in order to calculate the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of the resident, apply the same rates of tax as if the income or capital had not been exempted.\n\nb) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 13, paragraph 3 of Article 14, Article 16 or Article 20, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall allow as a deduction from the income tax on individuals or from the corporation tax of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the United Kingdom. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income derived from the United Kingdom.\n\nc) The provisions of sub-paragraph a) shall not apply to income derived or capital owned by a resident of Luxembourg where the United Kingdom applies the provisions of this Convention to exempt such income or capital from tax or applies the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10 to such income.\n\nArticle 23: Non-discrimination\n1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.\n\n2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.\n\n3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 4 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, or paragraph 4 of Article 20 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.\n\n4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.\n\n5. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident or to its nationals.\n\n6. The provisions of this Article shall apply to the taxes which are the subject of this Convention.\n\nArticle 24: Mutual agreement procedure\n1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of either Contracting State. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.\n\n2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.\n\n3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.\n\n4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.\n\n5. Where,\n\na) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and\n\nb) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the date when all the information required by the competent authorities in order to address the case has been provided to both competent authorities,\n\nany unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.\n\nArticle 25: Exchange of information\n1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.\n\n2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.\n\n3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:\n\na) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nb) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nc) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).\n\n4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.\n\n5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.\n\nArticle 26: Assistance in the collection of taxes\n1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Article 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.\n\n2. The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes covered by the Convention together with interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.\n\n3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.\n\n4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.\n\n6. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State.\n\n7. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be:\n\na) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or\n\nb) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection\n\nthe competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.\n\n8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:\n\na) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;\n\nb) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy;\n\nc) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice;\n\nd) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State;\n\ne) to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.\n\nArticle 27: Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts\nNothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic or permanent missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.\n\nArticle 28: Entitlement to benefits\n1. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n2. Where a benefit under this Convention is denied to a person under paragraph 1, the competent authority of the Contracting State that would otherwise have granted this benefit shall nevertheless treat that person as being entitled to this benefit, or to different benefits with respect to a specific item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if such competent authority, upon request from that person and after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, determines that such benefits would have been granted to that person in the absence of the transaction or arrangement referred to in paragraph 1. The competent authority of the Contracting State to which the request has been made will consult with the competent authority of the other State before rejecting a request made under this paragraph by a resident of that other State.\n\nArticle 29: Entry into force\n1. The Contracting States shall notify each other in writing, through diplomatic channels, that the procedures required by its law for the entry into force of this Convention have been satisfied. This Convention shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the later notification and shall thereupon have effect:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\n(ii) in respect of income tax and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\n(iii) in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 April of the calendar year next following the year in which this Convention enters into force;\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force;\n\n(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, and taxes on capital, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force.\n\n2. The Convention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed at London on 24 May 1967 as amended by the first Protocol signed at London on 18 July 1978, the second Protocol signed at London on 28 January 1983, and the third Protocol and accompanying exchange of letters signed at London on 2 July 2009 (the “prior Convention”) shall cease to have effect in respect of any tax with effect from the date upon which this Convention has effect in respect of that tax in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1.\n\n3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, the provisions of Article 24 (Mutual agreement procedure) and Article 25 (Exchange of information) shall have effect from the date of entry into force of this Convention without regard to the taxable period to which the matter relates, subject, in the case of Article 25, to the condition that the information could have been supplied under the provisions of the prior Convention.\n\n4. In respect of the development land tax and the petroleum revenue tax to which the prior Convention applies, the prior Convention shall cease to be effective from the date upon which this Convention enters into force.\n\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 and the provisions of Article 17 and paragraph 2 of Article 18, where, immediately before the entry into force of this Convention, an individual was in receipt of payments falling within paragraph 1 of Article XVIII or a pension falling within Article XIX of the prior Convention or a pension falling within Article XXII of the prior Convention and, but for the provisions of this paragraph, those payments or pensions would fall within Articles 17 or 18 of this Convention, that individual may make an irrevocable election within a period of three years from the date of entry into force of this Convention that the above-mentioned provisions of the prior Convention shall continue to apply to those payments.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, an individual who is entitled to the benefits of Article XX of the prior Convention at the time of the entry into force of this Convention shall continue to be entitled to such benefits as if the prior Convention had remained in force.\n\n7. The prior Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with this Article.\n\nArticle 30: Termination\nThis Convention shall remain in force until terminated by one of the Contracting States. Either Contracting State may terminate this Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force of this Convention. In such event, this Convention shall cease to have effect:\n\na) in the United Kingdom:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited after the date that is six months after the date on which notice of termination was given;\n\n(ii) in respect of income tax and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April next following the date on which the notice is given;\n\n(iii) in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the notice is given.\n\nb) in Luxembourg:\n\n(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given;\n\n(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, and taxes on capital, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the notice is given.\n\nIn witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Convention.\n\nDone in duplicate at London this seventh day of June 2022 in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authoritative\n\nProtocol\nAt the moment of signing the Convention for the Elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital and the Prevention of Tax Avoidance and Evasion, this day concluded between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Convention.\n\n1. With reference to sub-paragraph l) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 (General definitions) and sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Dividends):\n\nIt is understood that the term “recognised pension fund” includes:\n\na) in the case of Luxembourg:\n\n(i) Pension-savings companies with variable capital (sociétés d’épargne-pension à capital variable: SEPCAV);\n\n(ii) Pension-savings associations (associations d’épargne-pension: ASSEP);\n\n(iii) Pension funds subject to supervision and regulation by the Insurance Commissioner (Commissariat aux assurances); and\n\n(iv) the Social Security Compensation Fund (Fonds de Compensation de la Sécurité Sociale) SICAV-FIS;\n\nb) in the case of the United Kingdom, pension schemes (other than a social security scheme) registered under Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004, including pension funds or pension schemes arranged through insurance companies and unit trusts where the unit holders are exclusively pension schemes.\n\nThe competent authorities may agree to include in the above, pension schemes of identical or substantially similar economic or legal nature which are introduced by way of statute or legislation in either State after the date of signature of the Convention.\n\n2. With reference to Article 4 (Resident):\n\na) It is understood that a collective investment vehicle, which is established and treated as a body corporate for tax purposes in Luxembourg and which receives income arising in the United Kingdom shall be treated for purposes of applying the Convention to such income as an individual who is a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof), but only to the extent that the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries. However, if at least 75 per cent of the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries, or if the collective investment vehicle is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/65, the collective investment vehicle shall be treated as a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of all of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof).\n\nb) For the purposes of this paragraph the term “equivalent beneficiary” means a resident of Luxembourg, and a resident of any other jurisdiction with which the United Kingdom has arrangements that provide for effective and comprehensive information exchange who would, if he received the particular item of income for which benefits are being claimed under this Convention, be entitled under an income tax convention with the United Kingdom, to a rate of tax with respect to that item of income that is at least as low as the rate claimed under this Convention by the collective investment vehicle with respect to that item of income.\n\nc) For the purposes of this paragraph of this Protocol, the term “collective investment vehicle” means:\n\n(i) Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) subject to Part I of the law of 17 December 2010;\n\n(ii) Undertakings for Collective Investment subject to Part II of the law of 17 December 2010;\n\n(iii) Specialised Investment Funds (SIF) subject to the law of 13 February 2007; and\n\n(iv) Reserved Alternative Investment Funds (RAIF) subject to the law of 23 July 2016, with the exception of reserved alternative investment funds which choose to subject themselves to the regime of Article 48 of the said law,\n\nas well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in Luxembourg which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle.\n\n3. With reference to paragraph 4 of Article 4 (Resident):\n\nIt is understood that in applying this provision, the competent authorities shall have regard to:\n\ni) where the senior management of the person is carried on;\n\nii) where the meetings of the board of directors or equivalent body are held;\n\niii) where the person’s headquarters are located;\n\niv) the extent and nature of the economic nexus of the person to each State; and\n\nv) whether determining that the person is a resident of one of the Contracting States but not of the other State for the purposes of the Convention would carry the risk of an improper use of the Convention or inappropriate application of the domestic law of either State.\n\nThis list of factors is not exhaustive. The competent authorities will apply the provision on a case by case basis. As the facts upon which an agreement is reached may change over time the competent authorities may revisit agreements, particularly where there are significant changes in the relevant facts.\n\nWhere a company was resident in both Luxembourg and the United Kingdom under the domestic law of those countries before the entry into force of this Convention, and the status of that company was determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article IV of the prior Convention, the competent authorities of Luxembourg and the United Kingdom will not seek to revisit that determination so long as all the material facts remain the same. Where the material facts change after the entry into force of this Convention, and the competent authorities determine that for treaty purposes the company should be regarded as a resident of the other State (or the competent authorities do not reach a mutual agreement), that new determination (or the loss of treaty benefits pursuant to the absence of a mutual agreement) will apply only to income or gains arising after the new determination (or notice to the taxpayer of the absence of an agreement).\n\n4. With reference to Articles 10 (Dividends) and 11 (Interest):\n\nIt is understood that an authorised representative of an investment fund established in a Contracting State may submit a claim relating to the benefits afforded by the provisions of these Articles. The competent authorities may consult together with a view to putting arrangements in place which facilitate claims and resolving any doubts concerning eligibility.\n\n5. It is understood that:\n\nNothing in this Convention shall prevent Luxembourg from applying the provisions of Article 164ter of the income tax law or any other similar provision that amends or replaces the above-mentioned Article.\n\nIn witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.\n\nDone in duplicate at London this

Protocol were signed on 7 June 2022, the full texts of which have been published on the UK government's website&nbsp;<a title=\"Convention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital, and the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance (HM Revenu\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/luxembourg-tax-treaties/uk-luxembourg-double-taxation-convention-and-protocol-not-in-force\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Following the completion of ratification processes by both countries in 2022 and 2023, the DTT and Protocol formally entered into force on 22 November 2023, although most of the key changes will not take effect until 1 January 2024 at the earliest (and there will be later start dates for some taxes covered by the treaty, as noted below – in particular 1 April 2024 for UK corporation tax and 6 April 2024 for UK income tax and capital gains tax). Below is a non-exhaustive summary of notable changes for financial investors:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Introduction of capital gains property-rich clause </strong>-<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Article 13 (Capital Gains) now includes Article 13(2), which allows gains from the sale of shares in a property-rich company (or comparable interests e.g. partnership or trust interests) to be taxed in the jurisdiction where the immovable property is situated. ‘Property-rich’ is defined as an entity deriving more than 50 per cent of its value directly or indirectly from immovable property.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Royalty withholding tax (WHT)&nbsp;</strong>- Article 12 (Royalties) of the new DTT reduces the current 5% withholding tax on royalty payments to 0%. (Note that Luxembourg does not apply WHT to royalties in domestic law).</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dividend WHT </strong>-<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Article 10 (Dividends) is shorter and simpler than previously. Under the new article, in most cases, residents may claim a 0% withholding tax on dividends under the treaty (whereas currently the treaty provides for a 15% withholding tax on dividends in general, reducing to a 5% WHT limit where the recipient has at least 25% of the voting power in the company paying the dividend; noting that for dividends paid by a Luxembourg company the domestic participation exemption may reduce the WHT to 0% in any event in certain cases). However, Article 10(2)(b) allows for dividends paid by REITs or similar entities to be subject to a withholding tax not exceeding 15%, in line with most other UK DTTs (unless the beneficial owner of the REIT dividends is a recognised pension fund in which case the 0% rate applies). This provision should likewise apply in the event that Luxembourg introduces a REIT regime in future.&nbsp;Note for completeness that Article 22 regarding the elimination of double taxation in respect of dividends (among other items) has also been slightly reworded - – while not a ‘new’ provision, we note that the tax credit method has been retained in Article 22 as the method for eliminating double taxation on dividends as well as ‘property-rich’ disposal gains.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Company residence tiebreaker</strong>&nbsp;- Article 4(4) of the new DTT includes a competent authority/mutual agreement dual-residency tiebreaker. This replaces the current ‘place of effective management’ tie-breaker. Note that Article 3 of the new Protocol to the DTT sets out additional factors for the competent authorities to have regard to in this respect. It also includes a grandfathering clause for dual residents whose status \"was determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article IV of the prior Convention\" [...] \"so long as all the material facts remain the same\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Treaty access for Luxembourg collective investment vehicles</strong>&nbsp;- Article 2 of the new Protocol to the DTT has specific rules for Luxembourg-incorporated collective investment vehicles receiving income arising in the UK which, depending on their ownership and/or the nature of the beneficial owners, can allow the vehicles to be treated for DTT purposes as a Luxembourg-resident individual and the beneficial owner of the income it receives. The applicable definition of collective investment vehicle includes Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and Reserved Alternative Investment Funds (RAIFs) (note that unlike the other vehicles UCITS within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/65 are not subject to the aforementioned beneficial ownership test, and so are treated as Luxembourg resident without regard to their ownership). Unlike the Luxembourg vehicles mentioned here, note that no UK entity types are specifically referenced by the Protocol.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Permanent establishment (PE) definition changes:</strong></p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Specific activity exemptions<strong>&nbsp;</strong>- There are changes to the specific activity exemptions within Article 5 ('Permanent Establishment'). Article 5(5) and 5(6) introduces the BEPS-style anti-fragmentation rule. Article 5(4)(e), relating to activities of a preparatory or auxiliary character, has changed. Article 5(4)(f), relating to combination of activities with an overall preparatory or auxiliary character, has been added.</li>\n<li>Construction site&nbsp;- Article 5(3) states that \"<u>a building site, a construction, installation or dredging project</u>&nbsp;constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts&nbsp;<u>more than twelve months</u>\". This replaces the current treaty reference to a \"<u>building site or construction or assembly project</u>&nbsp;which exists for&nbsp;<u>more than six months</u>\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Business profits&nbsp;</strong>- Article 7 (Business Profits) is shorter and less prescriptive than its predecessor, and more in line with the OECD model article (in particular, the permanent establishment attribution rules have more regard to broader transfer pricing principles, as opposed to the more prescriptive wording used previously).</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration procedures&nbsp;</strong>- Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) continues to include a mandatory binding arbitration provision - see Article 24(5). This single paragraph is much shorter than the current synthesised treaty text’s seven-plus pages of prescriptive provisions on arbitration, based on Part VI of the BEPS MLI. Article 24(5) instead requires the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of the arbitration paragraph by mutual agreement.</p>\n<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>New collection of taxes provision&nbsp;</strong>- the new Convention includes Article 26 (Assistance in the Collection of Taxes). The current treaty does not contain such an article. Article 26 resembles the OECD model tax convention article of the same name, except for the addition of 26(8)(e) here, which clarifies that a Contracting State is under no obligation to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.</p>\n<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Entitlement to benefits </strong>-&nbsp;the new Convention includes Article 28 (Entitlement to Benefits) which introduces a principle purpose test for accessing treaty benefits (note: the same test is already in force under the current treaty as a result of the MLI, but has now been included as an article in the treaty itself in this revised version).</p>\n<h2>Entry into effect</h2>\n<p>The DTT and protocol <strong>entered into force</strong> on 22 November 2023 following the completion of both countries’ ratification and notification processes.
