Introduction\nThe permitted approaches to fitting yield curves for IFRS 17 were outlined in a previous white paper (Jessop 2018). The rules specify\ntwo approaches, known as ‘bottom up’ and ‘top down’ which in theory should lead to equivalent results (a unique set of IFRS 17\ndiscount rates). Our primary focus in this paper is in estimating the top down curves and specifically the adjustment for credit risk\npremium (which can be interpreted theoretically as the market premium associated with unexpected credit losses). The discount\nrates for liability valuation are not just critical in determining the present value of future cash flows reported in the balance sheet,\nbut also in determining how profit and loss will be recognised under the heading of ‘Insurance Financial Expenses’ in the\ncomprehensive income statement. The two yield curve approaches are outlined in Figure 3.\nFigure 1: IFRS 17 yield curve construction approaches\nExpected credit\nlosses\nCredit Risk\npremium\nYield Curve\nMismatch\nbased on actual\nadjustment\nor reference\nportfolio. Illiquidity\npremium\nIFRS 17\nDiscount Rate\nRisk Free Rate.\nTop Down Bottom Up\nAssuming the reference portfolio in the top down approach is defined in a way which minimises any mismatch adjustment (made\nto reflect differences in amount, timing and uncertainty between the reference asset portfolio and liabilities), then the most\nchallenging technical parts of the construction process are likely to be the adjustments for the expected credit losses and the\ncredit risk premium.\nDifferent approaches for calculating the expected losses are possible (leveraging a broad range of probability of default and loss\ngiven default modelling techniques). For example, under Solvency II (SII) a ‘through the cycle’ (TTC) approach to estimating the\ncredit losses is made which results in a very stable (effectively constant) estimate of the credit losses. This estimate is based on a\ncombination of long term historical default and loss given default statistics and long term historical credit spread levels.\nIf this TTC estimate of loss was used on its own (or in combination with a constant credit risk premium adjustment in order to\nisolate the liquidity premium component of spread) this would lead to most of the spread market volatility being attributed to\nchanges in liquidity premia.\nHowever, in SII more ‘point in time’ (PIT) volatility and matching adjustments are made by attributing only a proportion of the\nexcess spread to the volatility and matching adjustments. This proportional adjustment is somewhat ad-hoc, but can be\ninterpreted as a proxy for a pro-cyclical estimate of each component of the credit spread (embedding a view that market spreads,\nexpected losses and credit risk are all positively correlated). This results in liability discount curves which partially but not\ncompletely mirror changes in market spreads for credit risky bonds. In turn this reduces but does not minimise completely the\nsignificance of ALM mismatches arising when liabilities are backed by duration (or cash flow) matched fixed income asset\nportfolios.\n3 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIAENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nFigure 2 shows changes in market spreads (left) and PIT estimates of 1 year expected default frequency (right) over a ten year\nperiod for selected economies – in each case the averages are weighted by amount outstanding and are calculated for bonds with\nmaturities from 4-5 years.\nFigure 2: Changes in market spreads and PIT estimates of 1 year expected default frequency\nThe modelling method outlined in this paper leverages a structural approach to estimating both components of the credit\nadjustment. This approach naturally introduces point in time characteristics to not only the expected losses component of credit\nspread but also the estimates of credit risk premium and illiquidity premia. The method leverages existing data and modelling\ntechniques broadly used by Moody Analytics’ clients for probability of default, loss given default and expected loss modelling.\nIn section 2 we begin by reviewing the Merton model of credit risk, which will form the basis for the structural approach taken in\nthis paper. Having reviewed the basic model, we then detail the enhancement made by Moody’s Analytics to create our Public\nFirm EDF™ model of real world expected default. The section concludes by considering how the model can be reconciled with\napproaches to expected loss calculation for IFRS 9.\nSection 3 builds on the expected loss calculation to add a credit risk premium and derives a methodology to set this adjustment.\nSection 4 then applies the model to a set of market portfolios of corporate debt to derive a decomposition of spreads into\nexpected loss, credit risk premium and illiquidity premium components. Having applied the model, the sensitivity to several key\nunderlying assumptions such as equity risk premium, leverage and the choice of risk free rate is examined.\nFinally, section 5 concludes the paper by restating the fundamental problem to be addressed, the solution proposed in this paper\nand some considerations for further research in order to produce a robust method with could be implemented in practice.\n2. Estimating Real World Probability of Default\n2.1. A Brief Review of the Merton Model\nTo estimate the real world probability of default, we will follow a structural model of credit risk as pioneered by Fischer Black,\nRobert Merton and Myron Scholes.\nThe Merton model starts from the realisation that equity in a firm can be considered as a call option on the firm’s assets with a\nstrike price equal to the face value of the debt. The capital structure of the firm is defined simply as a sum of debt ( and equity\n( .\n𝐷𝐷)\n𝐸𝐸)\nThe asset price is assumed to follow a lognormal, stochastic process and default occurs when the value of the firm’s assets falls\n𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 =𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴+𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸\nbelow the value of the debt. Specifically, in Merton’s original formulation default occurs only if the asset price is below the debt at\na specified, usually one year, horizon. Figure 3 below shows the model schematically, where the asset value varies stochastically\nand forms a distribution of market values at a horizon, the probability of default is given by the integral of this distribution below\nthe default point.\n4 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIAENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nFigure 3: Merton Model Schematic\nWorking in the risk neutral measure we can write the stochastic process for the asset price as:\n(𝐴𝐴)\nℚ\nwhere is the risk free rate, is the volatility of t𝑑𝑑he𝐴𝐴 a𝑡𝑡s=set𝑟𝑟 𝑓𝑓p r𝐴𝐴ic 𝑑𝑑e 𝐴𝐴an+d σ𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑑𝑑 𝑊𝑊is a ,r isk neutral Wiener process.\nℚ\nThen, r 𝑟𝑟e𝑓𝑓calling that the optio 𝜎𝜎n𝐴𝐴 pricing framework where equity is a cal 𝑑𝑑l 𝑊𝑊on the assets, where the payoff for the equity is\nand is the face value of the debt, by Black-Scholes the market value of the debt will be given by\nmax(0,𝐴𝐴−𝐾𝐾) 𝐾𝐾\n−𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑇𝑇\nwhere 𝐷𝐷 =𝐴𝐴 N(−𝑑𝑑1)+𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 N(𝑑𝑑2),\n2\n𝐴𝐴 σ𝐴𝐴\nln� �+�𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓 + �𝑇𝑇\n𝐾𝐾 2\n𝑑𝑑1 = ,\nand σ𝐴𝐴 √𝑇𝑇\nWe can also write the market value of the debt as the dis 𝑑𝑑c2ou =nt 𝑑𝑑e1d −fac σe𝐴𝐴 v √a 𝑇𝑇lu\n.\ne to define a fair value spread\n−�𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓+𝑆𝑆�𝑇𝑇\nCombining the two expressions for the market value of the debt, we can then write the fair value spread as\n𝐷𝐷 =𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 .\n1 𝐴𝐴 𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓𝑇𝑇\n𝑆𝑆 =− ln� 𝐴𝐴 𝑁𝑁(−𝑑𝑑1)+𝑁𝑁(𝑑𝑑2)�.\nThe Merton model framework also allows us to derive the risk neutral probability of default\n𝑇𝑇 𝐾𝐾\nℚ\nSwitching to the real world measure we can replace the r 𝑃𝑃is 𝐷𝐷k fre =e r 𝑁𝑁at (e\n− 𝑑𝑑\n2w )i .t h the real world expected asset return to get a real\nworld probability of default\n𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴\nℙ ℙ\n𝑃𝑃𝐷𝐷 =𝑁𝑁(−𝑑𝑑2),\n5 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\neulaV\ntessA\nDistribution of\nRW Expected Market\nMarketValue of\nValue of Assets\nAssets at Horizon\nBetter\nCredit\nQuality\nWorse\nCredit\nQuality\nDefault\nPoint\nProbability of Default\nToday Horizon TimeENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nwhere\n2\n𝐴𝐴 𝜎𝜎𝐴𝐴\nln� �+�𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴− �𝑇𝑇\nℙ 𝐾𝐾 2\n𝑑𝑑2 = .\nThe Merton model is a simple, but widely used, starting point to u 𝜎𝜎n𝐴𝐴d √er 𝑇𝑇stand credit risk building from a structural analysis of the\nfirm. Since Merton’s original paper, many extensions have been proposed to account for more complex capital structures, to allow\nfor default at any point rather than a fixed horizon, stochastic interest rates, cash payments, and transaction and liquidation costs.\nIn the next section we describe the extension used in the Moody’s Analytics Public Firm EDF™ model.\n2.2. Moody’s Analytics EDF™ Model\nMoody’s Analytics’ Public Firm EDF™ (Expected Default Frequency) model has been the industry-leading probability of default\nmodel since its introduction in the early 1990s. Since that time it has continually evolved to provide a sophisticated model of real\nworld default frequencies. Moody’s Analytics EDF model is based on the Vasicek-Kealhofer (VK) variant of the Merton model\ndescribed above. This variant extends the Merton model in a number of key respects, in particular to consider a more complex\ncapital structure for a firm, with a range of liability classes for short and long term debt; to incorporate a concept of preferred\nstock; and to allow for cash leakages in the form of coupons, dividends and interest payments.\nThe EDF model also replaces the naïve use of the total debt in the Merton model with a default point calculated at the sum of\ncurrent liabilities plus half the long term liabilities. In addition, the latest version of the EDF model makes a cost of capital\nadjustment to the default point for financial firms, to reflect changes in interest rate environment and their effect on the depletion\nof working capital.\nBoth the Merton and VK models require an estimate of asset volatility to determine the distance-to-default. Unlike market\ncapitalisation, neither equity, nor asset, volatility are directly observable in the market and the estimation of volatility is therefore\nan important element of the calibration of the model. Moody’s Analytics EDF model uses a weighted average of empirically\nmeasured volatility over a historical window and a modelled volatility based on the size, location and business type of the firm.\nFinally, the EDF model removes the assumption of normality for the relationship between distance-to-default (DD) and the\nprobability of default. The distance-to-default gives an ordinal measure of the default risk. Interpreted as a number of standard\ndeviations, the DD can be converted to a PD, using a normal cumulative distribution function\nIn practice, Moody’s Analytics calibrate a more accurate empirical mapping\n𝑃𝑃𝐷𝐷 =𝑁𝑁(−𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷).\nThe calibration of the empirical mapping to a database of historical defaults is one of the primary inputs to the Moody’s\n𝑃𝑃𝐷𝐷 =𝑀𝑀(−𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷).\nAnalytics VK/EDF model and represents the key piece of IP within the model.\n𝑀𝑀(⋅)\n2.3. Consistency with IFRS 9: Moody’s Analytics ImpairmentCalc\nWhile the focus of this paper is the construction of discount curves for reporting liability valuations under IFRS 17, some firms may\nbe concerned with consistency with reporting impairments under IFRS 9. The latest accounting standards for financial instruments\nrequire the recognition of expected credit losses based on a forward looking assessment of credit risk. Calculating these expected\ncredit losses is also part of the requirement for adjusting top down IFRS 17 discount curves and it is therefore reasonable to expect\nsome consistency between the two estimates.\nThis paper uses a relatively simple methodology to calculate expected losses by combining unconditional EDFs and unconditional\nLGDs. However, for IFRS 9 (and CECL) Moody’s Analytics offers a more sophisticated approach via our ImpairmentCalc and\nImpairmentStudio™ solutions. This solution also leverages CreditEdge for EDF estimates, RiskCalc™ for LGD and GCorr™ for\ncorrelations between a range of macroeconomic and credit factors. Expected losses are then calculated by taking the\nunconditional EDF and LGD values and conditioning these on a set of macroeconomic scenarios1. By first conditioning EDF and\nLGD estimates on a set of macro variables, which are correlated with credit shocks, and then taking a weighted average across\n1 See Barnaby Black, Glenn Levine and Juan M. Licari, “Probability-Weighted Outcomes Under IFRS 9: A Macroeconomic Approach”, Moody’s Analytics Risk\nPerspectices, Volume VIII, June 2016\n6 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIAENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nthese scenarios, this process produces a granular, forward-looking and probability weighted estimate of the expected credit loss\nwhich takes into account correlations between PD and LGD estimates2.\nIn general, this more advanced methodology will produced expected credit losses which differ from the estimates presented in this\npaper. If full consistency with IFRS 9 results is desired, ImpairmentCalc expected credit losses could be used in place of the\nunconditional estimates used here without much difficulty for either top-down credit risk adjustment or to estimate illiquidity\npremium for bottom-up yield curve construction.\n3. Credit Risk Premium\n3.1. Adjusting the Merton Model’s Drift\nTo estimate the market compensation associated with credit risk we need to adjust the real world probability of default with a\ncredit risk premium. Schematically, we move back from the real world measure to an asset risk neutral measure where the real\nworld implied drift is replaced with the risk free rate. Removing the expected excess return shifts the probability distribution of\nmarket value of assets at the horizon and thereby increases the probability of default. An increased probability of default is\nassociated with a higher spread and the difference between the real world EDF implied spread and the “asset risk neutral” EDF\nimplied spread constitutes our credit risk premium spread.\nNote that the move to the asset risk neutral measure performed here is different from the usual shift from a real world to a risk\nneutral frame, in that case the risk neutral measure is designed to exactly match market prices and risk premia can be directly\ninferred by fitting our model to market data, in contrast here the shift to the asset risk neutral measure does not account for\nliquidity risk, and so the model spread in this measure will be different from the observed market spread – the residual difference\nbetween market spreads and asset risk neutral model spreads will be attributed to an illiquidity premium (see section 4.2).\nFigure 4 shows the three measures, real world, asset risk neutral and risk neutral schematically for the Merton model. As we move\nfrom the real world to the asset risk neutral measure the expected asset return decreases and the probability of default, and hence\nspread increases. The pure risk neutral measure, accounting for all risk premia, including illiquidity, has a still further lower\nexpected return and an even higher probability of default and spread. The three measures thus correspond to the expected credit\nloss spread, the expected loss plus the unexpected credit loss, and finally the observed market spread including both credit and\nilliquidity premia.\nMathematically, we can express the asset risk neutral spread as\n1\nwhere is the cumulative probabil𝑅𝑅it𝑁𝑁y o𝐶𝐶f𝑟𝑟 d𝐴𝐴e𝑑𝑑fa𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴u l𝑆𝑆t 𝑆𝑆u𝑟𝑟n𝐴𝐴d𝑆𝑆er𝑑𝑑 th=e r−isk nlenu(t1ra−l 𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶m𝑃𝑃e𝐷𝐷asu⋅r𝐿𝐿e𝐿𝐿.

Instead, we take the real world EDF data as fixed inputs and make an independent\nestimate of the credit risk premium which can be layered upon the EDF without needing to delve into the details of that model. In\nthe next section we describe our methodology for forming that estimate.\n3.2. Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nIn order to estimate a suitable adjustment to the real world probability of default, we need to determine an appropriate credit risk\npremium. Churm and Paniigirtzoglou (2005) convert an empirically estimated asset risk premium into an equity risk premium by\nconsidering the asset risk premium as a leverage weighted average of the observed market spread and the equity risk premium. We\nfollow a similar approach here, but working in reverse, to estimate an expected excess asset return.\nWeighted average cost of capital is a standard method in corporate finance to calculate the cost of capital by combining the cost\nof debt, cost of equity and a simple measure of the firm’s capital structure.\nFor our purposes we need a measure of premium, or the excess return, and so we define our WACC estimate of the risk premium,\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐶𝐶𝑜𝑜 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶 =𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴⋅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐶𝐶𝑜𝑜 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴+(1−𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴)⋅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐶𝐶𝑜𝑜 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸\n. Using this definition the cost of debt becomes the corporate bond spread and\nth𝑊𝑊e𝐴𝐴 c𝑊𝑊o𝑊𝑊st of equity the appropriate equity risk premium.

The market implied returns account for the entire market observed spread, not just for credit risk, but also\nilliquidity (and any other premia) priced by the corporate debt market, and so are substantially higher than the WACC estimates in\ngeneral, particularly for high asset volatility or low leverage. The WACC estimates of the excess return therefore add a credit risk\npremium which explains part, but not all, of the spread above the default compensation. Given our goal is to decompose the\nspread into three parts and distinguish credit and non-credit factors, this is promising.\n4 “Real World Calibrations Developed Equities Constant Volatility at End Jun 2018”, Moody’s Analytics Modelling and Calibration Services, July 2018\n9 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\nnruteR\nssecxE\nMarket Implied Return WACC Return\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n-0.05\n-0.1\nAsset Volatility\nnruteR\nssecxE\nMarket Implied Return WACC Return\nLeverage\n0.45\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nytilitaloV\ntessA\nLeverageENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nThe simple WACC estimate shown in Figure 5 uses a constant equity risk premium, making no allowance for firm specific factors\nlike industry specific betas and costs of equity capital.

Clearly the market implied data show little systematic relationship\nbetween the variables, though there is lower variation in price of risk for higher leverage. In contrast, the constant equity risk\npremium WACC price of risk is inversely related to asset volatility and increases with leverage. These trends probably indicate\nsystematic firm level dependencies for the equity risk premia, e.g. higher equity risk premia generally associated with higher asset\nvolatilities and lower leverage. At a portfolio level it appears that a constant price of risk, rather than a constant equity risk\npremium better represents the data.\nFigure 7: Market-implied and model prices of risk for each bond\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45\n-0.5\n-1\nWe discuss the equity risk premium in more detail in section 4.3.1, but note here that the simple WACC measure presented earlier\nclearly has too little variation (in both its specific and systematic behavior). We therefore investigate an alternative approach to\nestimating a WACC based credit risk premium which is better suited to portfolio analysis by leveraging broad market estimates.\nThe individual WACC estimate of the risk premium for each bond in our portfolio could be directly applied, such that the total\ncredit spread for both expected default losses and credit risk premium is given by\n𝑊𝑊𝐴𝐴𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊\n1 −1 𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴,𝑖𝑖\nwhere indicates\nth𝑊𝑊\ne\n𝐴𝐴 sp𝐶𝐶 e𝐶𝐶\nci\nf𝐼𝐼 i𝐼𝐼\nc\nb𝑆𝑆 o𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸 n𝐴𝐴 d𝑑𝑑\ni\nn𝐶𝐶 t𝑟𝑟 h𝐴𝐴 e𝑑𝑑 p𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴\no\nr𝑆𝑆 t𝑆𝑆 fo𝑟𝑟 l𝐴𝐴 io𝑆𝑆\n.\n𝑑𝑑 𝑖𝑖 =− 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖ln�1−𝑁𝑁�𝑁𝑁 (𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖)+\n𝜎𝜎𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖\n�𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖�⋅𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖�,\nHowever, for IFRS 17 the credit risk premium is only required at a portfolio level.

Results and Discussions\n4.1. Applying the Method to Market Portfolios\nTo analyse the results of the methodology proposed in this paper we apply it to five market portfolios of corporate bonds.\n• Merrill Lynch US High Yield Master II Index\n• Merrill Lynch US Corporate Master Index\n11 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\nnruteR\nssecxE\nMarket Implied Return Credit Risk Premium WACC Return\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-0.05\n-0.1\nAsset Volatility\nnruteR\nssecxE\nMarket Implied Return Credit Risk Premium WACC Return\nLeverageENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\n• Merrill Lynch Sterling Corporate Securities Index\n• Merrill Lynch EMU Corporate Index\n• Custom Filtration of ZAR denominated Corporate bonds\nFor each Merrill Lynch index we take the list of constituent bonds and filter any for which there is missing data in CreditEdge. For\nSouth Africa, we take all the fixed or zero coupon ZAR denominated nominal corporate bonds within CreditEdge. For the SA\nportfolio most bonds within the database were not rated by Moody’s and so this represents a broad market index across both\ninvestment grade and high yield.\n4.1.1. US Investment Grade\nThe Merrill Lynch US Corporate Master Index contains 7760 publicly-issued, fixed-rate, non-convertible, investment grade bonds\nwith at least one year to maturity and an outstanding par value of at least $250 million. Of these we found EDF, leverage and LGD\ndata for 6735 within the CreditEdge database.\nFigure 9 shows the result of applying these estimates of the credit risk premium to calculate the spread adjustment. The figure\nshows two sets of data one calculated using the first method proposed in Section 3.2, using an individual estimate of the WACC,\nand one using the second method, where the market implied return is scaled by the portfolio WACC. As predicted the individual\nWACC spread adjustment estimates contain substantially more variation, although the median relationship between credit risk\npremium and total market spread, illustrated by the dotted lines, is very similar for each approach.\nTable 1 shows the average spreads across the portfolio for both methods and the decomposition into expected loss and credit risk\npremium spreads. For each method of determining the appropriate credit risk premium, using either the individual WACC or the\nmarket implied return scaled by the portfolio WACC, two methods are presented for taking the average, using either a mean or\nmedian across the portfolio. The mean across the portfolio can be skewed by outliers and the duration weighting of the portfolio,\nwhile the media is more robust in this regard. In general we focus on the relationship between market spread and the credit risk\npremium spread adjustment rather than the absolute value. The preferred metric of the mean portfolio WACC is highlighted in\nyellow.\nThe table shows that using the individual WACC method the credit risk premium accounts for 48% of the total market spread\nwhen taking the mean credit risk premium/mean market spread, while with the portfolio WACC method the credit risk premium\naccounts for 32% of the spread on the same basis. In comparison the equivalent median data show that the premium explains\n35% of the fit using the individual WACC directly and 31% using the market implied return scaled by the portfolio WACC. Note\nthat using the portfolio WACC to scale the market implied return the mean and median results, for this portfolio, are almost\nidentical, while using the individual WACC directly produces a more skewed distribution.\nThe table also shows the results of performing least squares fits, for mean results, and least absolute deviation fits, for median\nresults. The least absolute deviation, median, fits are the gradient of the dotted line in Figure 9. The gradients of these fits, as\nexpected, are almost identical to taking the simple ratio of the credit risk premium spread to the market spread.\nTable 1\nUS Investment Grade Spreads\nMEAN RESULTS MEDIAN RESULTS\nINDIVIDUAL WACC PORTFOLIO WACC INDIVIDUAL WACC PORTFOLIO WACC\nMarket Spread 129.3 129.3 123.3 123.3\nExpected Loss Spread 21.2 21.2 13.9 13.9\nCredit risk premium Spread 61.5 41.4 43.7 38.5\nCredit risk premium Spread/Market Spread 0.48 0.32 0.35 0.31\nGradient Fit 0.49 0.33 0.37 0.32\n12 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIAENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nFigure 9: Credit risk premium spread for each bond in the portfolio - US investment grade\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n-100\n-200\n-300\nNote that in Figure 9 there are a number of bonds with a negative market implied excess return, and hence a negative credit risk\npremium spread adjustment when using the market implied return. These are bonds for which the CreditEdge EDF implies a larger\nexpected loss spread than the total observed market spread. In all of these cases the issuer is a state owned enterprise (either from\nChina or Abu Dhabi) where the market spread likely takes into account the expectation of additional, implicit guarantees for which\nthe EDF model does not account. The use of median fits above means that these small number of outliers can be left in the sample\nwithout substantially effecting the results and we do not need to manually filter the data.\nGiven the breadth of the US portfolio considered here, the final results, using the market implied scaling of the portfolio WACC,\ncan be broken down by sector and rating, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3. These tables show an increasing total spread and credit\nadjustment as ratings lower and a higher spread and credit adjustment for bonds issued by non-financial entities. The proportion\nassigned to each category, expected loss, credit risk premium and illiquidity premium is similar in each case, as expected given the\ntight relationship illustrated in Figure 9.\nTable 2\nUS Average Spreads by Sector\nTable 3\nUS Average Spreads by Rating\n13 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\n)pb(\nmuimerP\nksiR\ntiderC\nCRP (Individual WACC) CRP (Portfolio WACC)\nTotal Market Spread (bp)\nSPREAD EXPECTED LOSS CREDIT RISK PREMIUM ILLIQUIDITY PREMIUM\nFinancial 98.1 20.2 30.6 45.3\nNon-Financial 138.9 21.5 44.7 69.5\nSPREAD EXPECTED LOSS CREDIT RISK PREMIUM ILLIQUIDITY PREMIUM\nAAA 85.3 16.2 25.8 41.5\nAA 91.7 19.8 28.6 41.5\nA 106.6 22.0 32.9 49.4\nBBB 148.5 20.9 48.5 75.7ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\n4.1.2.

Using median estimates the individual WACC explained\nslightly over 60% of the spread and the portfolio WACC explained around 50%.\nFigure 10 shows the variation in estimates for each bond in the portfolio.

SA Corporate Bonds\nFor South African corporate debt available data within CreditEdge was substantially more limited than for the other portfolios\nconsidered in this paper. Overall we were able to find necessary EDF, LGD, Leverage and volatility data for 62 ZAR denominated\nbonds. Many of these were not rated and the vast majority were from financial organisations, see Figure 12. For SA bonds, LGD\ndata were sourced from Moody’s Analytics RiskCalc rather than CreditEdge as this database adjusts for country as well as sector\nand produced more plausible estimates. Results are calculated using spreads over swap rates and use an equity risk premium of\n2.89% as in our standard Scenario Generator calibrations and a tax adjustment of 80%.\n15 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\n)pb(\nmuimerP\nksiR\ntiderC\nMEAN RESULTS MEDIAN RESULTS\nINDIVIDUAL WACC PORTFOLIO WACC INDIVIDUAL WACC PORTFOLIO WACC\nMarket Spread 134.7 134.7 132.8 132.8\nExpected Loss Spread 25.8 25.8 21.1 21.1\nCredit Risk Premium Spread 79.5 50.7 59.1 48.3\nCredit Risk Premium Spread/Market Spread 0.59 0.38 0.45 0.36\nGradient Fit 0.62 0.38 0.50 0.38\nCRP (Individual WACC) CRP (Portfolio WACC)\nTotal Market Spread (bp)ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nFigure 12: Composition of SA corporate bond portfolio by industry sector\nTransportation\nSecurity Brokers & Dealers\nMining\nInvestment Management\nInsurance, Property/Casualty/Health\nInsurance, Life\nElectronic Equipment\nBanks & S&Ls\nAutomotive\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nTable 6 below shows mean and median market, expected loss and credit risk premium spreads calculated using either the\nindividual WACC credit risk premium or the market implied return scaled by a portfolio WACC. The table shows that using mean\nestimates across the portfolio the individual WACC credit risk premium explained around 140% of the market spread, while the\nportfolio WACC scaled market implied return explained just under 70%. Using median estimates the individual WACC explained\naround 120% of the spread and the portfolio WACC explained 61-68%. These results are noticeably higher than for the EU, US\nand UK portfolios considered above, and in particular the individual WACC approach seems to predict a credit risk premium\nsubstantially in excess of the total market spread. The portfolio WACC scaled by the market implied return predicts a more\nreasonable credit risk premium, but still predicts no illiquidity premium over the risk free instruments.\nThese results may be explained by the lower quality of data, and the far smaller sample size of the portfolio, the skew towards\nbanks and the likelihood of residual credit and illiquidity risk within the swap curve.\nFigure 13 shows the variation in estimates for each bond in the portfolio. As in previous cases, above, the individual WACC shows\nfar more variation and a more skewed distribution.

US High Yield Bonds\nFor high yield US bonds we use the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index. This index tracks dollar denominated publicly issued\ncorporate bonds with a below investment grade rating, at least one year to maturity, fixed coupons and a minimum outstanding\nvalue of $250m. At the time of access we recovered 1872 ISINs for constituent bonds, of which we could find leverage, EDF and\nLGD data for 1394.\nUnlike the portfolios listed above, Moody’s Analytics does not produce an estimate of equity risk premium specifically for a\nportfolio of US firms issuing high yield debt. In order to derive an appropriate cost of capital, there are a number of options.\nFirst the equity risk premium could be assumed to be equal to that used for the US investment grade portfolio.\nSecond, the investment grade ERP could be adjusted to account for the difference in average leverage between the two portfolios,\nby assuming the same unlevered ERP:\n𝑀𝑀𝐼𝐼\n𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 𝑀𝑀𝐼𝐼 1−𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴\nThird, a constant equity market price of risk could𝜇𝜇 b𝐸𝐸 e as=su𝜇𝜇m𝐸𝐸 ed⋅, and the ERP cou𝐻𝐻l𝐻𝐻d. be rescaled to account for the difference in\n1−𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴\naverage equity volatility.

The market implied returns show a higher cost\nof capital for firms with a lower credit rating, but a very similar market price of risk when accounting for the difference in\nestimated asset volatility. This suggests it might also be prudent for us to adjust the estimate of the WACC to account for this\ndifference in volatility.\nTable 7\nComparison of US Investment Grade and High Yield Portfolios\nINVESTMENT GRADE HIGH YIELD\nAverage Asset Volatility 12.7% 19.1%\nAverage Leverage 38.0% 43.5%\nAverage Spread (bp) 129.3 367.1\nMarket Implied Portfolio Return ( ) 5.12% 7.39%\nMarket Implied Portfolio Price of R 𝜆𝜆𝑀𝑀 𝐶𝐶is 𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀k\n𝑟𝑟\n𝑡𝑡( ) 0.404 0.387\n𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀\nΛ𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡\nTable 8 shows the impact of the four methods described above in terms of the implied equity risk premium, the WACC, the\nproportion of the market implied excess return ascribed to credit risk, the average credit risk premium spread and the proportion\nof the total market spread assigned to the credit risk premium. As expected, if the asset market price of risk is assumed to be\nconstant between the investment grade and high yield portfolios then the proportion of the total spread explained by the credit\nrisk premium is approximately constant, at 32% for both portfolios.\nIf the equity market price of risk is held constant, the higher average spreads for the high yield portfolio lead to a higher credit risk\npremium and a larger proportion of the market spread at 40%. Making no adjustment to the equity risk premium for differences in\nvolatility, leads to a notably lower cost of capital and a smaller proportion of the market spread explained by the credit risk\npremium, 23%-25%.\nTable 8\nUS High Yield Bond Equity Return Comparison\nEQUITY RISK PORTFOLIO PORTFOLIO PORTFOLIO WACC/\nPREMIUM WACC WACC MPR MARKET IMPLIED RETURN\nInvestment Grade ERP 4.04% 3.56% 0.186 48.2%\nRelevered ERP 4.44% 3.78% 0.198 51.2%\nConstant Equity MPR 6.69% 5.06% 0.265 68.5%\nConstant Asset MPR 5.48% 4.37% 0.229 59.2%\nUsing the constant equity market price of risk to define a high yield equity risk premium, produces the spread results detailed in\nTable 9. For the high yield data there is a significant difference between the mean and median results as the individual estimates,\nshown in Figure 14, exhibit higher variance and skew. For our preferred mean average using the portfolio WACC, the credit risk\npremium account for one third of the average spread.\n18 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIAENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nTable 9\nUS High Yield Corporate Bond Spreads\nFigure 14: Credit risk premium spread for each bond in the portfolio – US High Yield\n1500\n1300\n1100\n900\n700\n500\n300\n100\n-100 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\n4.2. Deriving an Illiquidity Premium\nUnder IFRS 17’s top-down approach to discount rate construction the total yield for the reference portfolio must be adjusted to\nremove the effect of credit risk, both expected losses and a credit risk premium. Assuming the reference portfolio is well matched\nto the associated liabilities, the credit-adjusted yield curve is taken as the appropriate discount curve. In principle there is no need\nto identify any spread over the risk free rate as an illiquidity premium. Using the bottom-up approach, however, there is a need to\nspecifically account for liquidity and the methodology described in this paper could be used in order to estimate the associated\nspread.\nIf the total observed market spread is assumed to comprise of only credit risk and illiquidity risk, then the illiquidity premium can\nbe defined as the residual after adjusting the total yield for the default spread and the credit risk premium:\nBased upon the results presented in section 4.1 the analysis suggests that the illiquidity premium accounts for around 30%-50%\n𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑑𝑑𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸 𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐼𝐼𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐼𝐼 =𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑 𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑 𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑−𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿−𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿.\nof the total spread, depending on the specific choice of methodology for the credit risk premium, the choice of risk free basis and\nthe economy under consideration.

Given that the method described here is able to estimate total yields and credit adjustments for each individual bond, a\nterm structure for the illiquidity premium could be estimated by directly fitting to the individual IP estimates, or by applying a\nscaling to the portfolio spread over the appropriate risk free rate.\nSecondly, is the adjustment applied as a point-in-time calculation using a snapshot of market spreads at a given reporting date? or\nshould the results be smoothed using historical data to determine either the credit risk premium or the total spread? In the next\nsection we investigate the sensitivity of the results to a number of modelling choices and parameters.\n4.3. Sensitivity to Model Assumptions\nThe results of sections 4.1 and 4.2 show that the WACC model of credit risk premium is able to generate intuitive results and\noffers a plausible route to estimating the credit risk adjustment for IFRS 17 discount rate construction.\nHowever, while the model aims to use market observable and implied data where possible, and utilise real world EDF and LGD\ndata in which we have confidence, there remain a number of key data inputs which can impact the results. In the sections below\nwe example the sensitivity of the model to two of these, equity risk premium, and the choice of risk free basis.\n4.3.1. Equity Risk Premium\nPerhaps the most important unobservable input to the model is the equity risk premium. Equity risk premia are a matter of\nconsiderable contestation in the financial literature and estimates can vary significantly. Brotherson et al. (2013) report that best\npractice, and by far the most common method, to calculate the equity risk premium for a specific firm is to use the CAPM. Within\ntheir survey there were a range of sources cited for the source of the market risk premium associated with the CAPM: historical\ndata, forward-looking dividend discount model (DDM), Bloomberg and expert judgement among them. These varied sources\nreturned a range of market equity risk premia between 4% and 9%, with a mean around 6.5%.\nWithin Moody’s Analytics we calculate forward looking equity risk premia for country specific market indices for use within the\ncalibrations of our Scenario Generator. Our methodology uses the Dimson, Marsh and Staunton historical analysis to set a global\narithmetic risk premia (in excess of cash) of 4%. To calculate risk premia across equity markets we then set a target covariance\nmatrix from target correlations and volatilities and calculate a vector of coefficients as\nΩ 𝛽𝛽\n1\n𝛽𝛽 = 2Ω𝑤𝑤,\nwhere is the global portfolio variance and are a set of weig 𝜎𝜎h𝑝𝑝s based on the observed relative market capitalisations. The\narithmet2ic risk premium of a specific country is then\n𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝 𝑤𝑤\n𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸,𝑖𝑖 =𝛽𝛽𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸.\n20 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\n)pb(\ndaerpS\nmuimerP\nytidiuqillI\nIP Spread (Portfolio WACC)\nTotal Market Spread (bp)ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nThe asset betas for specific firms could be produced using Moody’s Analytics GCorr™ or, alternatively, equity betas could be\nconstructed using data from Bloomberg or Barra (consistent with many responses to Brotherson).\nIn any case, the choice of cost of equity capital (equity risk premium) can make a noticeable impact on the credit risk premium, as\nshown in Figure 16 below, which holds everything else constant and varies the overall market equity risk premium, measuring the\nimpact on the credit risk premium. In this case, for a broad portfolio of USD denominated investment grade bonds, there is a non-\nlinear sensitivity where, at 4% equity risk premium a 1% change in risk premium produce a 14bp change in credit risk premium\nspread.\nFigure 16: Variation in credit risk premium spread with equity risk premium assumption\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 4.0% 4.5% 5.0% 5.5% 6.0%\nWhilst Moody’s Analytics estimates of equity index risk premia are periodically updated, the global arithmetic equity risk premium\nremains relatively constant over time. As such, the economy specific values, particularly for large markets like the US, will vary only\nto a limited degree. The largest contribution to any change in credit risk premium will therefore come through changes in the\nexpected losses, weighted by the leverage, and changes in volatility. The estimate for the credit risk premium may in consequence\nvary more slowly than total market spreads and the derived illiquidity premia may be more volatile than preferred.\nThe correlation between estimates of the total credit adjustment or liquidity premia and spreads on assets in this structural\nmodelling approach depends on the correlations assumed between spreads and the default probabilities and the correlations\nbetween spreads and the equity risk premia. It is worth noting that if we were to assume a positive historical correlation between\nspreads and the equity risk premia this would produce less volatile estimates of the illiquidity premia and more volatile estimates\nof the credit risk premia. This assumption is therefore a critical one in determining how effectively the illiquidity premia estimate\ndampens ALM volatility under the IFRS 17 framework.\n4.3.2. Risk Free Rate\nAlthough in principle a top-down approach to discount rate construction under IFRS 17 does not require us to define the risk free\nrate, our proposed approach in this paper, which scales a weighted average cost of capital by market implied returns, does\nimplicitly depend on the choice of risk free basis to define the overall market spreads. These spreads impact both the weighted\ncost of capital itself via the cost of debt, and the market implied returns. The choice of appropriate basis to define these spreads is\ntherefore important.\nThe text of the IFRS 17 standard states that the risk free rate should reflect the yield curve in the appropriate currency for\ninstruments with no or negligible credit risk. The question then arises as to whether either swap or treasury instruments exhibit no\nor negligible credit risk. Both could themselves be adjusted to account for residual credit risk, for example using interbank-OIS\nspread data, or CDS spreads respectively. The standard further states that the liquid risk-free yield curve should then be adjusted\nto reflect the difference in liquidity between the instruments underlying the observed market rates for the risk free curve and the\nliquidity of the insurance contracts. Either swap contracts or government bonds could in practice contain some illiquidity premia\nover a fully liquid risk free rate and care should be taken not to double count this premium.\nFor some economies the choice of risk free basis will not have a significant effect, for example, in the US results produced in this\npaper swap/treasury spreads are low. In other economies there can be a substantial swap/government spread and results will vary\ndepending on whether swaps or treasuries are used to define the credit spread, see Table 10 below. Figure 17 shows three spot rate\ncurves for EUR at end June 2018 and illustrates the significant spread between swaps and treasuries. In the case of the Eurozone\nthere is the additional complication that there is a single swap rate which crosses many countries each issuing their own\ngovernment debt a different rates. The Moody’s Analytics EUR government curve shown in the figure below is based on a\n21 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\n)pb(\nmuimerP\nksiR\ntiderC\nEquity Risk PremiumENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\ncombination of French and German bonds. In addition, where firms are valuing liabilities under the Solvency II regime, the\ndiscount curve published by EIOPA defines a last liquid point at 20 years for EUR, and extrapolates much more quickly from there\nto an unconditional forward rate than the market data, this can be seen from the difference between the Moody’s Analytics and SII\ndata in Figure 17.\nFigure 17: Three spot rate curves for EUR at end June 2018\n3.5%\n3.0%\n2.5%\n2.0%\n1.5%\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\n1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 46 51 56\n-0.5%\n-1.0%\nFor investment grade debt, during periods of market calm, the WACC is dominated by the cost of equity, which is typically\nsignificantly higher than the cost of debt, and so while the credit risk premium will vary depending on the choice of basis, the\nabsolute value of the average credit risk premium spread is not overly sensitive to the choice, see Table 10 for comparisons.\nHowever, during periods of market stress, e.g. during the financial crisis, the difference could be more material. Further, even in\nperiods with low average cost of debt, where the overall WACC does depend more strongly on the choice of basis, the illiquidity\npremium estimate will vary more substantially, as does the proportional relationship between total spread and credit risk\npremium. Table 10 shows that for EUR data at End June 2018 there was nearly a 50bp difference between the median spread over\nswap rates and the median spread over treasuries. The credit risk premium only varied by 7bp, but the illiquidity premium is 40bp\nlower using the residual over swap rates. For the UK there is a swap spread, and illiquidity premia swap spread of around 10bp and\nfor the US the difference between bases is even lower.\nTable 10\nRisk Free Basis Comparison\n5. Conclusion\nCalculation of credit and liquidity adjustments is a complex challenge. Estimates of illiquidity premia can vary substantially\ndepending on the choice of model and underlying assumptions (Hibbert 2009). Under IFRS 17, the methodology to set discount\nrates will be a key challenge. For many insurers the focus will be to ensuring that well matched balance sheets are stable and that\nP&L results are informative of real changes in underlying economic conditions and not simply accounting mismatches (Jessop\n2018). Insurers therefore need to be aware of the dangers of artificially introducing instability to their results as a consequence of\nmodelling choices whilst still capturing genuine changes in market conditions.\n22 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA\netaR\ntopS\nEUR GOVT (MA) EUR SWAP (MA) EUR SWAP (SII)\nMaturity\nSWAP TREASURY\nSPREAD CREDIT RISK PREMIUM ILLIQUIDITY PREMIUM SPREAD CREDIT RISK PREMIUM ILLIQUIDITY PREMIUM\nEUR 52.4 44.0 -12.6 99.3 50.9 28.3\nGBP 124.6 49.3 44.9 132.8 48.3 55.5\nUSD 123.3 38.5 63.2 119.2 37.3 61.3ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nThis paper lays out one potential method to calculate the necessary total credit adjustment, accounting for both expected loses\nand the credit risk premium, by leveraging Moody’s Analytics experience with credit loss calculations and combining that\nknowledge and modelling with established cost of capital techniques used in corporate finance. The expected loss adjustment\nconsidered in this analysis could easily be extended to reconcile with the more sophisticated impairment methods used by firms\nfor IFRS 9 and CECL.\nWe propose a credit risk premium which starts from an estimate of the weighted cost of capital at the level of the portfolio and\nscales this for each firm using market implied returns. Combining this credit risk premium with an estimate of the asset volatility\nallows us to estimate a spread adjustment and derive an illiquidity premium as the residual of the spread over the risk free rate\nafter adjusting for credit risk. We analysed this method for four economies considering both investment grade and high yield\ncorporate debt and considered the sensitivity of the results to several of the key model inputs.\nThis paper hopes to show that using a structural model of credit risk could be a useful method to derive discount curves for IFRS 17\nunder either the top-down or bottom-up approaches. In practice, some further work may be required to before firms commit to\nadopting such an approach. For example we would expect firms to want to:\n• Compare the estimated illiquidity premia with alternative benchmarks such as the EIOPA Solvency II Volatility\nAdjustment\n• To understand the stability over time of results and the sensitivity to changes in market data and assumptions about the\ntime varying behaviour of equity risk premium.\n• To potentially enhance the method to reconcile expected losses with IFRS 9 impairment calculations\n• To develop robust methods to apply where data (particularly ratings, or market price) is scarce\n• To extend the analysis to further asset classes, such as government debt, infrastructure and structured loans.\n• Understand the liquidity characteristics of liability contacts and resolve how to transfer an illiquidity premia derived for a\nportfolio of assets to a set of insurance contracts.\nWhile a number of significant open questions need to be addressed when implementing IFRS 17, we believe the methodology\npresented here is promising, not least because it has the potential to be applied to address most of these considerations.\n23 DECEMBER 2018 A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIAENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\n6.
