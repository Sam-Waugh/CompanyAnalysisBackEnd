This focus has produced an unintended consequence, in that many bank managers cannot\nafford adequate time and resources to develop and refine their own internal approaches to measuring and\nmonitoring risk, and those who can afford it, may feel less motivated to do so. This holds true in all areas\nof risk management. For example, the UK regulator’s proposals for Pillar 2 liquidity1 appear to pile on even\nmore regulatory pressure, beyond the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR),\nwhich are both important elements in the Basel Accords. It is our view that the proposals for cash flow\nmismatch risk (CFMR), signal an era of relative calm in the sea of regulations. Banks should exploit this\nhiatus to implement integrated solutions covering regulatory compliance, internal risk management, and\nrisk-adjusted pricing.\nThe Basel III Metrics\nDuring the financial crisis, inadequate liquidity proved to be the undoing of many financial institutions,\nboth in terms of the drying up of interbank lending markets and bank runs. Supervisory authorities\nresponded by tightening regulatory requirements governing liquidity risk. The liquidity coverage ratio\n(LCR) is the key metric in Basel III. Its aim is to secure institutions’ short-term financial solvency in the\n30 calendar days prescribed by the regulator stress scenario. Another significant metric for strengthening\nbanks’ medium- to long-term liquidity profiles is the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires banks\nto ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. Banks must maintain stable sources of\nfunding, such as traditional deposits, in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet\nactivities, to survive a one-year period of extended stress. By limiting maturity mismatches, NSFR reduces\nrollover risk and promotes funding stability.\nThe LCR is being implemented gradually, starting in 2015, when the ratio was set at 60% or higher. The\nimplementation must be finished in 2019, with a ratio higher than 100% - though in the UK, the regulator\nalready expects banks to meet the 100% ratio. Banks have until 2018 to meet the NSFR standard. Over\ntime the NSFR will be reviewed as proposals are developed and industry standards implemented. LCR and\nNSFR are stipulated and binding (Pillar 1) metrics.\nBecause they have faced considerable challenges in the implementation of these liquidity ratios, until\nnow, institutions have focused on appropriately calculating and reporting LCR and NSFR, typically to the\ndetriment of their own internal risk management profiles, which have had to take a back seat.\nIn a parallel trend, internal risk management teams have adopted, or learned to speak, the language of the\nregulatory supervisor, even if they are not directly involved in preparing reports. Credit institutions around\nthe world are in near-constant communication with their regulators on liquidity conditions, capital levels,\nand credit exposures. The “ability to speak to the regulator” is increasingly seen as a requirement for senior\nrisk management roles, and this requirement has cascaded down the entire function. Supervisory regulators\nwant access to more specific, granular, and timely information so they can identify and address real and\npotential issues.\nThe pressure to respond, often at short notice, to requests from supervisors has led senior management to\ndemand that internal reports must be “regulator ready”. Where new internal risk measures or stress tests\nare developed, these also need to be comparable to, and often couched in the same terms as,\nregulatory metrics.\n1. For additional information, refer to Prudential Regulation Authority publication ‘Pillar 2 liquidity – CP13/17’\n3 OCTOBER 2017 LIQUIDITY RISK: SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES REMAIN, BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO AUTOMATE & INTEGRATE.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nInternal Liquidity Risk Management\nInternal risk management is not necessarily significantly different from what is demanded by regulators.\nHowever, the overall approach is based on an analysis of the maturity transformation that occurs in the\ninstitution’s own banking book rather than the “one size fits all” approach of stipulated standard ratios.\nTherefore, there is greater latitude to identify and address nuances within particular institutions. Essentially,\nliquidity is the ability of a financial organization to meet its commitments when they fall due. It is a\nprocess that must be managed on a daily, or even real-time basis, requiring bankers to monitor and project\ncash flows to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained. Liquidity might be required to fund customer\ntransfers and settlements or to meet other demands generated by the bank’s business with its clients.\nAlmost every financial transaction or financial commitment has implications for a bank’s liquidity, unless\nof course a bank is very cash-rich. Liquidity risk management helps make certain of a bank’s ability to meet\nits cash flow obligations in a variety of scenarios. An important element of asset & liability management\n(ALM) is thus to prevent a liquidity mismatch of assets and liabilities (an imbalance in the maturity term\ncreating a liquidity gap).\nIn the lead-up to the financial crisis, many banks that had grown used to funds being readily accessible\ndid not have an adequate framework that satisfactorily accounted for the liquidity risks required by their\nindividual products and business lines. Incentives at the business level were out of alignment with the\noverall risk tolerance of these banks; failures at the most exposed institutions affected even those that\nwere following best practice as the liquidity crisis became systemic. Hence the imposition by the Basel\ncommittee of binding Pillar 1 metrics such as LCR and NSFR.\nOver the past 10 years the focus has thus moved away from risk-based balance sheet management\nto regulatory compliance with stipulated values, which is why traditional internal risk assessment best\npractices have taken a back seat, even if they have not been entirely neglected. As banks discovered with\ncredit risk management a few years ago, when regulatory capital edged out economic capital, maintaining\ntwo sets of definitions is challenging and costly. Being a mandatory requirement, regulatory measures will\nalways win this battle, regardless of whether or not it forms the optimal basis for internal risk management.\nThe only way to circumvent this dilemma is to implement an automated technical infrastructure capable of\ncombining similar methodologies.\nPRA110: Gold-plating LCR?\nOn the face of it, the UK regulator’s recent consultation paper “CP13/17 Pillar 2 Liquidity” on cash flow\nmismatch risk (CFMR) suggests that it accepts the need to align with Basel, while also regarding the\nBasel metrics as insufficient. The LCR categories are not the metrics that the banks would have chosen\nthemselves, but it is the regulators that are leading the way, not the banks. Consequently there are\nobjections that the UK regulator is now “gold-plating” a standard – LCR – that has already been agreed\nat the European level, drawing yet more resources away from internal risk management to regulatory\ncompliance. On the other hand, many in the industry rightly pointed out when LCR was announced that no\nsingle standardized measure could take account of every aspect of liquidity risk, arguing for a Pillar 2 type\nof approach.\nThe introduction of this new regulation brings together the old regime with the ratio-based metrics of the\nBasel Accords, the latter being regarded as rather blunt instruments for managing liquidity risk; they leave\nmany gaps unplugged and cracks unfilled. CP13/17 Pillar 2 Liquidity states:\nThe Pillar 2 framework is intended to complement the Pillar 1 regime by considering liquidity risks not\ncaptured, or not fully captured, under Pillar 1. Assessments under the Pillar 2 framework form part of\nthe PRA’s Liquidity Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (LSREP). In designing a Pillar 2 framework\n4 OCTOBER 2017 LIQUIDITY RISK: SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES REMAIN, BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO AUTOMATE & INTEGRATE.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nto assess and mitigate significant sources of liquidity risk, the PRA is seeking to ensure that firms have\nadequate liquidity, which contributes to the PRA’s objective of promoting the safety and soundness of\nfirms.\nIn other words, the metrics relating to the additional monitoring tools are designed to complement the\nsupervision of an institution’s liquidity risk beyond the scenario for which the liquidity coverage ratio\n(LCR) is defined. The proposed new regulatory regime harmonizes reporting for the whole liquidity risk\nframework. With CP13/17 Pillar 2 the UK regulator proposed a new reporting template, PRA110. This\nbuilds on the European Banking Authority’s ALMM (additional liquidity monitoring metrics) C66 2016\nrecommendation, adding a couple of new sections (see Figure 1).\nFurthermore, CP13/17 reverts to the individual liquidity guidance (ILG) approach of the old regulatory\nregime, which it now supersedes; in our view, it should therefore not be regarded as ground-breaking from\na regulatory standpoint. The UK regulator’s previous regime for liquidity risk compliance covered 10 sources\nof risks, many of which are not covered by LCR such as intra-day liquidity. These are now effectively being\naligned with the language of LCR in the PRA110 template.\nIn PRA110 new rows and columns have been added to align with LCR; these are conveniently indicated\nwith color coding in the template. However, similar to the UK regulator’s earlier approach, CP13/17 gives\nbanks a degree of freedom in choosing the behavioral models and assumptions that they want to use in the\nmonetization framework.\nFigure 1: The evolution of PRA110 from the EBA’s ALMM C66 recommendations.\nWHAT IS NEW IN PRA110?\nThe UK regulator’s CFMR framework focuses on the following sources of liquidity risk:\nLow Point Risk\nUnder LCR, firms must hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover their cumulative liquidity\nneeds over 30 calendar days. If a firm experiences a peak liquidity need within the 30-day window that is\ngreater than its requirement on day 30, the firm is exposed to the additional net outflow (the difference\nbetween the peak and end-month requirement). But it does not necessarily hold sufficient HQLA to cover\nthese additional outflows on that day.\n5 OCTOBER 2017 LIQUIDITY RISK: SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES REMAIN, BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO AUTOMATE & INTEGRATE.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nHQLA Monetization Risks\nFirms might not be able to monetize sufficient non-cash HQLA to cover cumulative net outflows under the\nLCR stress daily. There are likely limitations to the speed with which cash can be raised in the repo market\nor through outright sales, linked to market depth, the number of a firm’s regular counterparties, individual\nturnover, settlement times and so on.\nCliff Risk\nThe LCR focuses on a 30 calendar day horizon. Firms can “window-dress” their LCRs by pushing maturity\nmismatches just beyond the 30-day horizon (that is monitor 90-day horizons).\nFX Mismatch Risks\nFirms typically assume that currencies are exchangeable given the depth of liquidity in the spot FX and FX\nswap markets, particularly in reserve currencies. However, firms might not be able to access FX markets as\nusual in times of stress.\nTHE NEW SECTIONS IN PRA110\nIn addition to the requirement for greater granularity on LCR outflow, inflow and counterbalancing\ncapacity, the PRA110 template adds the following headings:\nContingencies\nFor granular LCR stress, PRA110 requires the reporting of outflows from committed facilities for “other”\nand “liquidity facilities” at more granular level (breakdown by counterparty type) and the impact of cash\noutflows in each notch (maximum of eight notches) due to downgrade triggers.\nMemorandum Items\nPRA110 does not require the reporting of five LCR components. However, for granular LCR stress, there are\nadditional reporting items to capture the flow of assets from collateral swap transactions, securities flow\nfrom some HQLA items, and derivatives margining and exposure.\nMonetization Framework of HQLA\nMonetization Actions: capture the assumptions on the limitations the bank is likely to face in monetizing\nnon-cash HQLA (that is the speed with which they expect to be able to monetize different types of non-\ncash HQLA, daily, via repo markets and outright sales, in time of stress).\nCumulated Liquidity Resources Post Firm Actions: capture the expected end-of-day cash and unencumbered\nasset positions, on a cumulative basis.\nSome practical challenges remain\nFrom the practical implementation (as opposed to regulatory) standpoint, many banks might nevertheless\nstruggle to implement the requirements where they have separate systems for, on the one hand LCR, and\non the other hand the wider risk management required by the UK and other regulators. The requirements\nhave shifted again. For example, under the previous UK regulatory regime the ILG metric required a survival\nhorizon approach, whereas the LCR was only ever a 30-day point approach. Now the PRA110 requires\nLCR itself to be turned into a survival horizon (that is banks must demonstrate a positive position through\ndays 1-30, not just on day 30. If up to now the two have been tackled in separate systems it can cause\nsignificant disruption to align them.\n6 OCTOBER 2017 LIQUIDITY RISK: SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES REMAIN, BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO AUTOMATE & INTEGRATE.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nIf banks are looking to tackle this disparity in their systems, then ALM/Treasury managers will need to\nexert influence to make sure they can align the full set of their regulatory and internal risk management\nrequirements in whatever the end state is chosen. In other words, in our opinion they should opt to\nintegrate regulatory and internal management systems, rather than maintain separate systems. It has been\ndifficult to achieve this over the past because previously the rate of regulatory change has been so rapid.\nIntegrating ALM Functions\nBanks can take this alignment of regulatory metrics as an opportunity to integrate with their internal risk\nmanagement, along with other ALM functions. The Pillar 1 metrics are now settled and in place and calmer\nwaters appear to be returning to the compliance environment. The Pillar 2 metrics give banks greater\ndiscretion in measuring key risk drivers that is they align with internal risk management best practices,\neven if couched in regulatory terminology. From an implementation point of view, banks can take this\nopportunity to move towards a strategic solution on managing risk. Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n(IRRBB) is another new regulation that takes a non-standardized approach to interest risk, following the\nadvice of two rounds of consultation with the industry. IRRBB should be managed in conjunction with\nliquidity risk, as there is a major overlap between the two; after all, both are designed to shore up balance\nsheet risk. From a reporting perspective, costs could be compressed if IRR and liquidity are consolidated\nin the same reports (based on the same data). The CP13/17 proposals are not simply for an externally\nregulated compliance project, as was the case with Basel I and Basel II; most of the assumptions are now\nunder the supervision of ALM (as this is Pillar 2) and in the specific case of LCR it needs to be monitored\ndaily, because it has a real cost for the bank.\nThere might be a hiatus in the constant waves of new regulations that we have seen over the past ten\nyears, but we believe the turnaround times expected by both regulatory supervisors and top management\nremain as tight. If the ALM team is to return to its “real job”, that is analyzing risks and taking the\nappropriate mitigating actions, automation will be essential, as will be software solutions that not only\nchurn out the standard reports required by the regulator but also offer the flexibility to carry out a broad\nrange of “what if” and scenario analyses.\nAsia Also Seeking to Emulate Best Practice\nAs an aside: in Asia, Basel III requirements are largely regarded as having been designed to address the\nproblems of the USA and Europe, with Asian voices under-represented on the Basel committees and other\ndecision-making forums. The new rules aim to resolve the under-capitalization and excessive leverage of\nthe wholesale banking model prevalent in the West, in contrast to the prevailing retail banking model in\nAsia, where heavy reliance on equity capitalization allows banks to meet the Basel III capital requirements\nwith relative ease.\nHowever, Asian countries have diverse objectives for economic development and their banking systems\nare at varying stages of maturity. The economic slowdown in the West has shifted the focus onto regional\nfinance. In the future, Asia’s continuing growth is likely to put the credit system under increasing, but\ndiverse, strains.\nFor these reasons there is a growing perception first, that there is actually a lack of appropriate regulation\nin the region, and second, that the one-size-fits-all approach of Basel III does not meet local requirements.\nIn particular, the region’s developing capital markets make it difficult and costly for Asian banks to meet\nthe liquidity standards of Basel III because of an insufficient supply of local government bonds. Thus, while\nAsian banks are aware of the Pillar 1 liquidity regulations, many regard their main weakness as the heavy\nreliance on prescriptive measures that do not allow for flexibility and discretion on the part of both banks\nand regulators in support of specific national economic agendas.\n7 OCTOBER 2017 LIQUIDITY RISK: SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES REMAIN, BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO AUTOMATE & INTEGRATE.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nThis absence of appropriate national and regional regulatory regimes has driven increased interest on the\npart of Asian banks in emulating the risk management best practices of European and American banks. This\nis particularly true in areas of risk management that might not previously have been tackled as extensively\nas in Europe, for example IRRBB.\nToward an Integrated Framework\nWe believe that banks now have greater clarity over the regulatory compliance environment than at any\ntime since before the financial crisis. The Pillar 2 recommendations on liquidity help to complete the\npicture and the waves of new regulations are abating, in terms of both their intensity and frequency. At the\nsame time, banks’ asset quality is currently stable or improving in the USA and most European countries,\ndespite sluggish economic growth.\nMany banks – including some of the largest European banks – have been understandably reluctant to\ninvest in strategic technology platforms for managing risks since, for nearly a decade, they have always\nbeen focused on the latest regulatory project. The current environment presents banks with an excellent\nopportunity to get off the compliance treadmill and move forward with a strategic vision that looks beyond\nthe next round of reports.\nBanks should therefore use the current window (it is impossible to say how long it will last) to adopt\na common platform within their ALM function that can cover all the relevant aspects of regulatory\ncompliance (in particular, IRRBB and liquidity management). Having computed all the relevant metrics\nfor the different risk drivers, these can then be used to allocate the cost of the risk components to\neach transaction. ALM teams will then have a solid basis for implementing an accurate internal pricing\nmechanism. In its most mature state, funds transfer pricing (FTP) will price all risks to which product lines\nare exposed, influencing the volumes and terms upon which they trade in the market. By integrating\nregulatory compliance, internal risk management best practices, and risk adjusted pricing through a\ncommon platform, banks will not only establish more resilient and sustainable business models but also\nequip themselves with the flexible analytical and modeling capabilities that are needed to design new and\nmore profitable product lines in the future.\nConclusion\nThe new proposals set up in the UK regulator’s consultation paper CP13/17 are set to harmonize the LCR\nand NSFR Pillar 1 (stipulated) metrics of the Basel III Accords with the Pillar 2 (non-stipulated) approach to\nmeasuring risk drivers that were at the center of the old UK reporting requirements. We believe that the UK\nregulator’s Pillar 2 recommendations represent a final piece in the liquidity regulatory requirements that\nhave been shifting for the last 10 years. Banks finally have clarity about regulatory demands in this area.\nThe requirements set by external regulators continue to be challenging, but we believe that with this\nrelative calm and clarity, now is the time to master the challenges by automating the process as much as\npossible and consolidating data so that it is readily available when needed for business as well as regulatory\npurposes. The necessary first steps on this journey consist of establishing a unified, consolidated data\nrepository that allows liquidity risk and compliance managers to understand the scale and scope of their\nassets and liabilities, together with the ability to analyze as necessary to assess the detail of the results.\nDoubts about upcoming regulatory changes have often made banks reticent about investing in software\nthat can manage a broad range of functions including IRRBB, liquidity risk and risk-adjusted priding.\nHowever, the compliance environment is now clearer, and the current window of opportunity will not\nstay open forever. Once the regulatory dust has settled, success will depend on taking the opportunity to\nrevamp systems efficiently with a long-term view.\n8 OCTOBER 2017 LIQUIDITY RISK: SOME PRACTICAL CHALLENGES REMAIN, BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO AUTOMATE & INTEGRATE.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\n© 2017 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
