Rather than hand-coding a specific\nset of task-focused instructions, the machine is “trained” using large amounts of data and\nalgorithms to learn the task.\nFigure 1 AI Definitions\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING M ACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 1Machine learning has already brought several benefits for actuaries:\nFigure 2 Benefits of Machine Learning in Actuarial Modeling\nMachine learning techniques have been applied to a range of actuarial applications including:\n» Mortality forecasting1\n» Customer support\n» Marketing\n» Predicting future claims as part of pricing tool\n» Utilizing unstructured data in forecasting interest rates2\nThe Challenge\nUnder IFRS 17 and other new reporting frameworks, insurers must:\n» Increasingly run actuarial models to model their business on a seriatim (policy by policy) basis\n» Run those models a greater number of times in a reporting cycle\nThe increasing amount of policy data that insurers have available fuels the challenge - as well as the requirement for better, more\ntimely management information. With these demands, the resulting costs and extended runtimes can be onerous, even with\ntoday’s powerful technology. Therefore, management’s ability to make fast, informed decisions based on timely results may be\nimpaired.\nOur Solution - Agglomerative Clustering\n1 https://www.theactuary.com/features/2020/08/05/machine-learning-deep-end\n2 https://www.actuaries.org.uk/documents/practical-application-machine-learning-within-actuarial-work\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 2To address this challenge, Moody’s Analytics has implemented many powerful model efficiency techniques to help improve\nperformance. In particular, the AXIS system supports both traditional and advanced data compression/grouping methods. These\nmethods reduce data models that contain many policies into fewer model points which each represents several original policies.\nPolicy grouping traditionally involves using a fixed, predefined set of rules to group individual policies into a smaller number of\nrepresentative policies. This is done without regard to the varying impact of that compression on model accuracy.\nClustering is a statistical technique commonly used to identify naturally occurring groups within large amounts of data. This\ntechnique can be applied to insurance modeling and overcomes the disadvantages of traditional grouping. In a seriatim data\nmodel, natural data clusters can be found due to similarities in product features, timing of policy issuance, policy holder age, and\nfund guarantee levels. All of these features impact the modeled cash flow patterns. Clustering compression techniques in the AXIS\nsystem work within these clusters to reduce the impact on accuracy, and enable a flexible approach to determining the final\namount of compression to be used.\nLike traditional grouping, a “central” policy represents the whole cluster, by scaling up the central policy’s calculated results.\nHowever, clustering differs from traditional grouping in many significant ways.\nFigure 3 Clustering v.

In the AXIS system, an “agglomerative”\nclustering technique is used. Under this approach:\n» Each policy starts as its own \"cluster\"\n» Distance (similarity) between every pair is calculated using chosen location variables (characteristics) for each policy\n» The least important cluster by size and distance is found and merged into the nearest cluster\n» Clustering process continues until the target compression is achieved.\nThe following diagrams show the clustering process for a simple example, with 20 seriatim policies of varying sizes and\ncharacteristics and a target compression ratio of 20% - reducing the policies into four clusters.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 3Step 1: Seriatim data assigned location variables Step 2: Distances between all pairs calculated\nand size\nLV\nY\nLV\nX\nStep 3: Closest pairs identified Step 4: Least important clustered with larger\nadjacent point\n3\n3\n4\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n5\nStep 5: Next closest pairs identified Step 6: Least important clustered with larger\nadjacent point\n10\n6\n7\n9\n2\n2\n2\n2\n6\n8\n2\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 4Step 7: Remaining closest pairs identified to reach Step 8: Final clustering performed.

Ideally, policies from the same cluster should deliver model results close to those of the cluster’s representative policy.\nIn this case, the error introduced by the substitution of a policy by its cluster representative will be small, suggesting that the best\nlocation variables are the actual policy results themselves (for example, a seriatim reserve). However, this would involve\nperforming the full calculations for each policy, negating the advantage of clustering.\nNeural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling or decision-making tools which attempt to emulate the immense parallel\ncomputing power of the human brain. Such networks can be used to model complex relationships between data inputs and\noutputs or to find hidden patterns in data. Neural networks effectively learn from their experience and adapt their logic and\npredictive models accordingly. Moody’s Analytics has developed a technique of creating and optimizing the location variables\nneeded for effective clustering using a neural network approach.\nConfiguring and using a neural network involves the following steps:\n1. Select neural network architecture\n2. Select activation functions\n3. Train the neural network to find parameters which optimize it\n4. Use the neural network to predict output values\nNeural network architecture\nA neural network contains a sequence of layers:\n» Input layers which provide the initial data used within the neural network\n» Output layers which produce given outputs for the neural network to deliver the result.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 5» Hidden layers which are intermediate layers between the input and output layers. The number of hidden layers can be user-\ndefined. In theory, one hidden layer is sufficient if it has enough nodes. In practice, deep networks (those with multiple hidden\nlayers) do the same job with fewer total number of weights and nodes. We have found that two or three hidden layers work\nwell.\nEach layer is made up of a set of nodes. The number of inputs into and outputs required from the Neural Network defines the\nnumber of nodes in the Input and Output layers. Each node in the hidden layers takes as its input, a combination of the outputs\nfrom the previous layer. The combination is usually a weighted sum shifted by a bias term. Each node then processes its signal\nthrough an activation function and outputs it to the next layer.\nFigure 4 Neural Network\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 6In the Neural Network architecture shown in Figure 1, the outputs from each layer are calculated as follows:\nFor Hidden Layer 1:\n3\n1 1 1 1\nFor Hidden Layer 2: 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗(𝑍𝑍)=Φ �� 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗+𝑤𝑤0,𝑗𝑗�\n𝑖𝑖=1\n4\n2 2 1 2 2\nFor the output layer: 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗(𝑋𝑋)=Φ �� 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗+𝑤𝑤0,𝑗𝑗�\n𝑖𝑖=1\n3\n3 3 2 3 3\n𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗(𝑋𝑋)=𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗(𝑋𝑋)=Φ �� 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗+𝑤𝑤0,𝑗𝑗�\n𝑖𝑖=1\nWhere:\n» is the input to the Neural network from Input node i\n» 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 is the weight applied to the input to node j in layer k coming from node i of the previous layer (with i=0 identifying the\nbia𝑘𝑘s term)\n𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗\n» is the activation function used to process inputs in layer k\n𝑘𝑘\n»\nΦ (𝑥𝑥)\nis the output from node j in layer k\n𝑘𝑘\n𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 (𝑋𝑋)\nActivation Functions\nThe optimal choice of the activation function depends on the application. The AXIS system currently supports the following\nactivation functions (depending upon a layer):\n1\n𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆: 𝜎𝜎(𝑧𝑧)= −𝑧𝑧\n1+𝑒𝑒\n𝑧𝑧 −𝑧𝑧\n𝑒𝑒 −𝑒𝑒\n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ: 𝑡𝑡𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ(𝑧𝑧)= 𝑧𝑧 −𝑧𝑧\n𝑒𝑒 + 𝑒𝑒\n𝐿𝐿𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿: 𝑙𝑙(𝑧𝑧)=𝑧𝑧\n𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑆𝑆 𝐿𝐿𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 (𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒𝐿𝐿𝑈𝑈): 𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟(𝑧𝑧)=max (0,𝑧𝑧)\n𝑧𝑧\n𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆: 𝑆𝑆(𝑧𝑧)=ln (1+𝑒𝑒 )\nIn choosing an activation function to use, clients should consider the relationship between the inputs and outputs of the\nrelevant nodes. Also consider boundaries to be applied to the outputs. Examples of considerations include:\n» If non-linearity is observed in these relationships, then the linear activation function will not be appropriate as it will not\ncapture these patterns. This function also may not be suitable if bounds on the outputs exist as there are no upper or lower\nbounds on the values that the outputs can take.\n» If a lower bound of 0 is required, then the ReLU function may be appropriate but is still unbounded. It is also non-\ndifferentiable at z=0. This problem can be avoided by using the SoftPlus function. As z tends to the Softplus function\ntends to which approaches 0 and as z tends to it tends to which approaches z so is a smooth approximation to\nthe ReLU f𝑧𝑧unction. −𝑧𝑧 −∞\n𝑒𝑒 ∞ 𝑧𝑧+𝑒𝑒\n» The Tanh and Sigmoid function will allow non-linear relationships to be captured. It will also bound output values between 0\nand 1 (Sigmoid) or -1 and 1 (Tanh)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 7After the number of layers and activation functions have been selected, the neural network can be used to approximate the\ndesired result for each policy. The process for using the neural network can be split into two sub-processes:\n» Training: Find the parameters (weights and biases) which optimize the neural network.\n» Scoring: Using the neural network to predict the outputs for the full set of policies.\nTrain the neural network\nA subset of the policies can be run through the full model to create outputs for training data. The Neural Network is trained\nusing these results. Given the input and output variable values for the training set; the training process aims to find the weights\nthat minimize the square error across all outputs for all records.\n# 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛#𝑜𝑜𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝 𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 2\n𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎\n𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒 𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿= � � �𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗 (𝑍𝑍)−𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗 (𝑍𝑍)�\n𝑖𝑖=1 𝑗𝑗=1\nWhere:\n» are the output values produced by the neural network\n𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝\n» 𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗 ( 𝑍𝑍ar)e the actual policy results\n𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎\n𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗 (𝑍𝑍)\nThe training data used should be representative of the full set of policies – both in terms of distribution and number of records.\nThe training will lead to a better approximation of the input values in the areas for which more data is available. To ensure that\nthe network also produces valid outputs for policies outside of those used for training, the training data may be split into two\nparts. Some policies will not be included in the training process, but scored by the resultant neural network. This means that the\nerrors between the accurate full model results and the scored results can be calculated.\nUse the neural network to predict output values\nAfter the Neural Network is trained (optimal weights are found), it can be used to score the outputs for policies not included in the\ntraining set. In the clustering process, the complete policy set’s Neural Network scoring results are used as location variables. As\nthe results approximate the actual policy results; utilizing them in this way improves the likelihood that the representative policies\nwill generate results, consistent with those of the policies clustered together.\nConclusion\nThe continued development of machine learning techniques introduces interesting possibilities for how they can be used to extend\nthe usage of actuarial models. Through the adoption of new techniques, improved data quality, greater performance, and\nincreased automation, these techniques allow actuaries to make more effective use of the increasing amounts of data available.\nThe ability to train neural networks and use them to replace trial and error experimentation within the AXIS actuarial system\nopens up a range of applications. This paper has highlighted one of the key ways that they are utilized: to improve the use of\nclustering as a model efficiency technique, allowing actuaries to improve their own efficiency and ability to support regulatory\nreporting. It also improves management decision-making on a flexible, timely, and cost-effective basis.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTUARIAL MODELING TO IMPROVE MODEL EFFICIENCY THROUGH BETTER CLUSTERING 8© 2022 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
