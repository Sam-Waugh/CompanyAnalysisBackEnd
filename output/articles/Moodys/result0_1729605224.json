Regulatory scrutiny brings challenges that have\nsignificant implications for CRE professionals across various functions,\nincluding operations, risk management, and forecasting.\nThis report outlines the current state of the regulatory environment,\nincluding the challenges banks with high CRE concentration face, and how\nMoody’s CRE solutions can help decode and address these nuances.\n4In the wake of change:\nmarket adaptions and\nregulatory reactions\nA POST-PANDEMIC HISTORY\nThe economic trajectory following the Covid-19 pandemic serves as a\nreminder that consumer behavior and market conditions are always\nevolving. What’s more, many of the loans for these properties will\napproach maturity in the coming years.\nThe Federal Reserve published a report showcasing the latter half of\n2023, when large banks saw a substantial increase in loan delinquency\nrates, particularly among the Office sector. Additionally, very low\ntransaction volume has limited price discovery. As a result, lenders have\nbecome more reliant on appraised values, creating concern that\ncollateral values may be overstated.\n5Reevaluation of\nregulatory practices\nSignature Bank’s, Silicon Valley Bank’s, and First\nRepublic Bank’s collapse in spring 2023 was largely\ncaused by liquidity constraints and led to a paradigm\nshift in the regulatory environment. Regulatory agencies,\nincluding the Federal Reserve, bore the brunt of the\nblame, with critics arguing that the agency failed to\nimplement sufficiently rigorous stress tests on bank\nbalance sheets, especially given the rising interest rates\nand prolonged yield curve inversion.\nAgencies are concerned that institutions with\nconcentrated CRE exposures are particularly vulnerable\nduring downturns. As a result, regulators have begun to\nenforce stricter rules and guidelines. Lenders and\nborrowers face the complex task of evaluating how\npotential increases in their debt service obligations under\nvarious adverse scenarios would affect their financial\nstability.\n6Today’s regulatory landscape\nANALYZING PROACTIVE MEASURES FROM REGULATORS\nRegulators are aware of commercial real estate’s traditionally cyclical nature– particularly how the\nlows can provide some of the greatest risks to banks due to loan defaults and losses.\nAgencies including the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have been on high alert since the\npandemic, honing in on CRE due to its susceptibility to market volatility and external factors.\nShare of Bank Total Assets\nBank Category Multifamily Commercial Funded CRE Total Direct\nCRE Loans CRE Loans Construction Loans CRE Exposure\nFed \"Large\" Banks 1.4% 2.1% 0.8% 4.4%\n(25 banks,>$160B total assets)\nRegional Banks 4.8% 8.9% 4.0% 17.8%\n(133 banks, $19-160B total assets)\nCommunity Banks 6.0% 14.0% 5.8% 25.7%\n(849 banks, $1-10B total assets)\nSmall Banks 3.1% 10.3% 5.3% 18.7%\n(2,890 banks, $100mm-1B total assets)\nSmall Banks 0.9% 3.9% 2.5% 7.3%\n(726 banks, <$100mm total assets)\nNYCB 33.9% 6.7% 2.8% 43.4%\nSource: NYCB Announcement Foreshadows Trouble to Come in 2024, but CRE-Related Downside Has Limits\n7Navigating increased regulatory\nscrutiny\n8Challenges of enhanced regulatory oversight\nTHE CRITICAL ROLE OF ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES AND COMPREHENSIVE STRESS TESTING\nBanks operating in the CRE space face heightened scrutiny, increasing the need for\ncomprehensive loan-level stress testing. A regulatory examination’s level of intensity varies\nbased on the bank’s size and the threat of perceived risks within its CRE portfolio.\nTherefore, having an ongoing strategy to adapt to internal and external changes is\nparamount for all banks with commercial real estate in their books.\nMandated stress tests for CRE loans are designed to assess their resilience. By evaluating\nhow different occupancy levels and rental rates affect these loans, the tests determine if\nbanks can endure challenging scenarios, including unprecedented headwinds and high\ninterest rates. Economic conditions change every year, prompting regulators to adjust their\ntesting criteria accordingly. The dynamic nature of these tests presents a persistent\nchallenge for banks striving to demonstrate their financial stability.\nBanks with large CRE portfolios must understand how interest rate fluctuations\nimpact their mortgage valuations. This uncovers insights that enable them to\nstrategically manage and mitigate future market volatility impacts.\n9Preparing for regulatory\nchallenges\n10Regulatory frameworks and\nrisk assessment in banking\nCAMELS: Capital adequacy, asset quality, management,\nState and federal regulators engage with banks on a periodic basis, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk\ntypically every 12-18 months, employing the Uniform Financial institution\nRating System (often referred to as CAMELS) to evaluate banks' health\nacross various dimensions; meanwhile, other institutions are evaluated\nusing the RFI rating system. The CAMELS and RFI rating systems are RFI: Risk management, financial condition, and the Impact of\nthe non-depository entities on the subsidiary depository\nmeasured from 1 (strongest) to 5 (weakest), indicating the level of\ninstitutions\nperformance.\nThe current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology updates the US\naccounting rules’ generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to CECL: an accounting standard introduced by the Federal\nbetter predict losses from loans and other assets. It uses past data loss, Reserve to estimate allowances for credit losses\nfuture financial predictions, and the current economy to make these\nestimates, replacing the old method that waited for losses to happen first.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) is an estimation of the ALLL: an accounting estimate that represents the acceptable\nprobable net charge-offs (the amount of loans expected not to be repaid) amount to cover potential credit losses in a loan portfolio\nand serves to adjust the value of the loan portfolio reported on the balance\nsheet to adjust for expected loss.\nCCAR: is the Federal Reserve stress test for large US banks\nThe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is an annual\nto evaluate their capital adequacy and risk management\nassessment that helps major financial institutions maintain a forward-\nunder economic shocks\nlooking and resilient capital planning process tailored to their specific risks.\n11Navigating the regulatory review process\nIT IS CRUCIAL THAT BANKS ENGAGE IN PROACTIVE DIALOGUE with\nregulators during the review process while also maintaining a paper trail to\ndemonstrate compliance and ongoing efforts to mitigate identified risks. To\nadapt to regulatory agencies’ evolving demands, banks must conduct\nthorough reviews of their past year’s regulatory evaluations, focusing on the\nidentified deficiencies and what measures they took to address them.\n12FDIC CRE regulatory oversight\nAdopting strategic measures for stability in\nvolatile markets\nThe FDIC’s December 2023 financial institution Letter, Managing\nCommercial Real Estate Concentrations in a Challenging Economic\nEnvironment is based on a version from 2008 when the market was\ndeep in the throes of the financial crisis. The FDIC urges banks to\nregularly analyze the collectability of their exposures; this involves\nassessing the probability of repayment for issued loans.\nAdditionally, the FDIC strongly recommends that banks diversify their\nfunding sources, incorporating a blend of retail deposits, wholesale\nfunding, and various financial instruments. It’s also crucial for banks to\nmanage their reserves effectively by allocating capital to cushion\nagainst potential loan defaults. Stress testing is also advised. By\nmodeling various adverse economic conditions, banks can gauge\npotential impacts on their loan portfolios.\nSee slide 5 for instructions on how to update footer 13FDIC’S SIX KEY RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES FOR BANKS WITH CRE CONCENTRATIONS\n1\n• Capital maintenance is crucial for institutions to safeguard against unexpected losses, particularly in stressed markets.\nMaintain strong capital levels • institutions with significant exposures to construction and development (C&D) and commercial real estate should hold additional capital as\na proactive measure.\n2\nEnsure that credit loss allowances • Allowances for credit loss (ACL) must comply with GAAP, reporting instructions, supervisory guidance, and management’s best judgment.\n• Credit losses for both individually assessed loans and the remaining loan portfolio should be addressed.\nare appropriate\n• GAAP mandates use of historical data and supportable forecasts to assess loan collectability and determine credit loss.\n• Parts 364-365 of the FDIC rules and regulations highlight the need for institutions to manage the higher risks associated with significant\nC&C and CRE concentrations.\n3 Manage construction and\n• Institutions must have information systems that supply the board with data on concentration levels and market conditions.\ndevelopment (C&D) and CRE • Stress testing and sensitivity analysis are essential for assessing the impact of economic changes on asset quality, earnings, and capital,\npromoting continuous improvement in risk management and capital planning.\nloan portfolios closely\n• Effective risk management includes having a strong credit and risk rating system, along with managing interest reserves and loan\naccommodations, to accurately.\n4 • Institutions should keep up-to-date borrower financial statements, including property cash flow statements, rent rolls, guarantor personal\nMaintain updated financial and\nstatements, tax returns, and other income property performance data.\nanalytical information • Consideration of appraisals and evaluations from various economic conditions is crucial as the economic landscape shifts.\n• This detailed information is essential for conducting meaningful stress testing and scenario analysis.\n5\nBolster the loan workout\n• Ensuring staff have the right skills to handle problem loans is key to resolving legal, appraisal, brokerage, and property management issues.\ninfrastructure\n• Implement processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control liquidity and funding risks.\n6\n• Maintain diverse and stable funding sources, which are especially crucial during economic challenges.\nMaintain adequate liquidity and\n• Maintain adequate levels of cash or cash equivalents.\ndiverse funding sources\n• Identify and test sources of contingent liquidity, including access to the Federal Reserve discount window.\n• Proper liquidity management enhances an institution's ability to support CRE profitability.\n14Federal Reserve\nCRE oversight\nLARGE BANKS POSE THE\nGREATEST RISK AND ARE TESTED\nANNUALLY USING THE CAMELS\nIn fall 2023, the Federal Reserve released its SYSTEM, WHILE MIDSIZE BANKS\nSupervision and Regulation report, explaining\nWITH $100-250 BILLION MAY BE\nits developments in 2023 and priorities for\nEXAMINED EVERY OTHER YEAR.\n2024. The Federal Reserve Board is focused on\nmonitoring CRE credit fluctuations, loan risk\nratings, and risk management reporting\nprotocols.\nSupervisors may opt to further examine banks\nthat appear riskier; for instance, an additional\ncredit quality and risk management test may\nbe required at a bank with a rapidly growing\nCRE concentration.\nREVIEWS ARE CENTERED ON\nEVALUATING CREDIT RISK\nMONITORING AND MEASUREMENT,\nINTERNAL LOAN RISK RATING\nACCURACY, RISK MITIGATION\nEFFORTS ON CRE LOANS, AND CRE\nRISK REPORTING TO THEIR FIRM'S\nBOARD AND SENIOR\nMANAGEMENT.Regulatory\nframework for\nsmaller banks\nCBOS AND RBOS\nSmaller banks with under $100 billion in total\nconsolidated assets are inspected using the CAMELS\nsystem and RFI rating. Smaller banks including\ncommunity banking organizations (CBOs) have less\nthan $10 billion in total assets, and regional banking\norganizations (RBOs) have total assets between $10\nbillion and $100 billion.\n16EVALUATING CBOS’ AND RBOS’ RESILIENCE\nFederal oversight of CRE loan management\nCBOs and RBOs hold a high percentage of the banking sector’s CRE loans, so these players\nface increased scrutiny from the Fed. Based on June 2023 findings, many CBOs and RBOs were\ndescribed as “satisfactory”. Examiners closely monitor the management of liquidity risk and\ncontingency funding plans as well as a bank’s ability to respond to unexpected deposit\noutflows.\nThe FRB encourages these banks to maintain reliable, actionable, and diversified funding\nsources in addition to sufficient collateral to access funds quickly. Expect the Fed to continue\ndemanding robust risk management reports that quantify a changing economy’s impact.\n17CCAR and the Federal Reserve\nSimulating economic downturns\nThe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, implemented following\nthe 2008 financial crisis, is now a key regulatory tool. It assesses banks’\nresilience to severe economic downturns, aiming to mitigate potential\nsystemic risks in future crises. Over time, CCAR has undergone\nsubstantial development, incorporating additional scenario elements and\nelevating regulatory standards for capital planning and stress testing\nprocedures at major financial institutions.\nThe CCAR annually evaluates banks on credit, market, and liquidity risks\nthrough hypothetical scenarios. These results are published by law,\nallowing public scrutiny of bank performance under stress tests. Banks\nare required to submit their capital plans and undergo stress testing\nunder hypothetical scenarios, including severe economic downturns, but\nmany institutions find it challenging to keep pace with evolving\nsupervisory expectations.\nUsing advanced computational tools and models not only facilitates\ncompliance with regulatory requirements but also supports strategic\ncapital planning and risk mitigation efforts. Utilize technology to simulate CCAR scenarios, forecasting your portfolio's performance under\ndiverse stress conditions. This approach helps in gaining an in-depth understanding of\nLearn more about CCAR scenarios in Commercial Mortgage Metrics.\nvulnerabilities, enhancing risk management practices, and making well-informed decisions.\nSuch strategic measures are crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance and bolstering financial\nresilience.\nClick here\n18Key OCC updates to CRE lending\nMODERNIZING RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\nThe OCC posted a revised version of the Commercial Real Estate Lending booklet in March 2022, which provides guidance for prudent risk management and\nbest practices for compliance. The updated booklet applies to community and national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies\nof foreign banking associations. Examiners use the booklet to evaluate each bank depending on its individual circumstances. The new version of the booklet\nincludes OCC issuances that have been published and rescinded since the 2017 edition and incorporates modernized risk management and supervisory\nguidance.\nThere are specific guidelines laid out for banks when examining CRE portfolios, particularly regarding credit risk reviews and internal auditing. The booklet\nhighlights the importance of banks issuing periodic, independent credit risk reviews to verify risk rating accuracy and operational effectiveness to assess the\nportfolio’s overall quality. Internal audits offer critical information regarding the effectiveness of internal controls typically including underwriting,\ndisbursement, credit administration, workout activities, and ALLL or ACL processes, among others.\n19Evolving practices for CRE\nloan workouts\nOn June 29, 2023, regulators issued a joint statement on commercial\nreal estate loan accommodations and workouts. This statement was\nFRB\nfirst issued in 2009 following the global financial crisis and incorporates\nminor accounting-related updates.\nThe statement offers a framework for approaching commercial real\nestate loans in a manner that can relieve borrowers and lenders if\napplied judiciously. The policy provides guidelines detailing how to\nmodify and extend loans without facing losses. REGULATION\nOCC FDIC\nFRAMEWORKS\nThe 2023 updates include a recommendation that banks accommodate\nborrowers who face financial challenges and demonstrate an honest\nwillingness to repay debts. Institutions that properly implement prudent\nCRE accommodations are absolved from criticism by regulators.\nNCUA\n20Consequences of noncompliance\n21Implications of noncompliance\nRegulatory compliance is crucial in banking to ensure financial stability, consumer protection, and\nsystem integrity. However, some banks occasionally fail to meet these standards.\n“Banks that are\nIf financial shortcomings or risk issues are found, regulators may issue “matters requiring attention”\n(MRA) findings or “matters requiring immediate attention”(MRIA) findings to prompt swift and effective approaching\nresolution of these concerns.\nregulatory thresholds\nNoncompliance poses two main threats: a downgrade in CAMELS rating, affecting a bank's operational\nfreedom, reputation, and increasing oversight; and the supervisor’s potential enforcement actions.\nfor CRE parameters\nSupervisory ratings are issued yearly for larger firms and every 18 months for smaller ones.\nrisk damaging\nconsequences and\npunitive measures to\ntheir institutions.”\n- Blake Coules, Senior Director\nIndustry Practice Lead\n2222Regulatory outlook\n23Assessing banks’ financial stability and resilience\nTo assess banks’ financial stability and resilience under extreme economic conditions, the Federal Reserve conducts\nannual stress tests, an essential tool for regulatory oversight. There were 31 banks included in the 2024 Federal Reserve\nstress test results report that passed the “severely adverse” test requirements for commercial real estate.\nTable 2.
