A key driver for insurers updating their\nAssociate Director-Research\nmodeling frameworks has been the need to implement evolving regulations and standards\nContact Us such as IFRS 17. Also, they have increased their modeling capacity as the model runs necessary\nto meet these new regulatory requirements increase, while the timeframes for performing this\nAmericas\n+1.212.553.1658 modeling decrease.

Insurers\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com\nmust put appropriate model controls and governance in place to reduce opportunities for\nJapan\nerrors in the modeling process.\n+81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com\nIncreasing demands on the actuarial function mean that modeling teams must review their\nprocesses to identify how best to meet both higher productivity and tighter controls. In this\npaper, we will look at some of the key areas actuarial functions are examining to help address\nthese pressures and challenges. We will also explore some of the opportunities in these areas\nthat can both add value to and increase efficiency of the actuarial modeling process.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GETTING MORE FROM YOUR ACTUARIAL MODELING 1Technology\nIncreases in actuarial modeling needs and complexity have caused increasing demand for a high-performance computing\ninfrastructure on which insurers can run their models, and models that can effectively exploit new technology. The availability of\ncloud computing has changed the actuarial function, as its scalable calculation capacity has transformed how actuarial models can\nbe deployed. The scalability has reduced actuarial model runtimes without the cost and ongoing support associated with\ntraditional on-premises computing hardware.\nIn addition, the use of cloud technology has introduced more flexibility for actuarial functions. With traditional fixed hardware,\ncalculation capacity must be set to a level that is sufficient to support an insurer’s peak modeling requirements during critical\nreporting periods. Adding further fixed capacity can be a costly process both in terms of the capital expenditure for extra hardware\nand the resources required to implement it.\nConversely, cloud users can easily add capacity by accessing resources in minutes without the upfront capital cost and IT effort\nassociated with fixed hardware. Cloud users pay only for the resources they need, and typically benefit from the latest technology\nperformance improvements. The on-demand capacity avoids the need to queue up modeling runs while awaiting available\nresources. Insurers can deploy extra resources quickly for each new modeling run and then deallocate them after the run is\ncompleted. The result is not only faster turnaround, but also greater predictability of runtimes and more capacity to cope with\nemergency reruns of critical steps.\nModel control and automation\nThe rising complexity of actuarial models—combined with shorter timeframes in which to produce results—has increased the\nsignificance of modeling errors. Identified modeling errors mean that insurers must rerun the actuarial models. Undetected errors\ncan lead to incorrect model outputs being used as the basis for management decisions or included in financial disclosures. Both\nactuaries and insurers’ senior management must focus on controls and strengthened model governance to reduce the risk of\nmistakes during the development, configuration, and running of actuarial models, and in the reporting of their results.\nOne significant way to improve model control is to automate the use of the actuarial models in production processes as much as\npossible. Automation not only lessens the risk associated with manual intervention in the process, but also ensures that the\nmodels run efficiently in the minimum runtimes. In an ideal situation, the automation implemented should:\n» Allow the required model runs to be performed with the single click of a button (or even no clicks if scheduling is supported)\n» Incorporate the preparation and configuration of model inputs (for example, policy data, economic scenarios, and\nassumptions)\n» Perform all the runs required, including any adjustments required to perform stressed runs\n» Produce all model results in required formats\n» Generate control information useful to detect any anomalies vs. expected results\nOpen or closed?\nWith greater interest in improving model control and reducing operational risk, some insurers are revisiting the question whether\nto use open or closed systems. Open systems typically allow insurers more opportunities to implement their own code in their\nactuarial models. However, these systems present more scope for potential errors in the complex algorithms of modern actuarial\nmodels. Alternatively, closed systems provided by third parties may deliver more confidence through the rigorous model\ndevelopment and testing processes implemented by the system provider. If the system is used by multiple companies, then it also\nbrings additional validation from its use by other insurers.\nAs insurers balance the strengths and weaknesses of the two system types, some are finding the optimum solution to be a\ncompromise between the two. The core calculation engine may be delivered as a closed system, but with an architecture that\nallows a significant degree of customization. Such a system enables users to program formulas and custom logic in a way that\ndoes not compromise system integrity and performance. This may, depending on the system provider’s design philosophy, also\nensure compatibility with future releases and enable easy upgrades. Finding the balance between the two is important. Choosing\nan open modeling system can give the actuarial modeling team access to more of the underlying system code. However, this\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GETTING MORE FROM YOUR ACTUARIAL MODELING 2choice can be counterproductive. The extra user coding introduces a higher level of model risk for the insurer—making the\nimplementation of appropriate model governance harder.\nIn addition, support, maintenance, and upgrading of modeling system code is a highly specialized function. It requires expert\nprogramming skills, including understanding of good programming practices, and advanced actuarial knowledge. Also, as\npreviously discussed, implementing new technologies means that the infrastructure on which models run is rapidly changing. Thus,\nas an actuarial function takes on more coding responsibilities, the more they must bear the cost of these modeling experts, and\nany key man risks introduced. Modeling systems require maintenance and frequent enhancement either through a dedicated\nmodeling team or by bringing in external expert resources. The more of the system that is maintained by an external professional\nsoftware company, spreading the costs over multiple insurers using the same core system, the more cost-effective it can be for the\ninsurer to outsource.\nConclusion\nActuarial modeling applications that rely on out-of-date technology and systems constrain the performance and cost-\neffectiveness of actuarial departments. These applications can contribute to unacceptable and often unknown levels of model risk\nfor many companies. As insurers update their modeling frameworks to meet the changing actuarial environment, they look for\nopportunities to transform their actuarial processes to cope with emerging needs. They seek solutions that combine improved\nflexibility, lower model risk, better model performance, and reduced IT costs.\nActuaries must harness the capabilities offered by developments such as cloud computing for their modeling work and use\nfunctions with greater automation to improve model control and reduce their model risk. Thus, they may confidently face the\naggressive challenges of new regulations and standards in a timely and effective way. It is also possible that this new modeling\ncapability will help unlock new analytics, enhanced value, and transformational change.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GETTING MORE FROM YOUR ACTUARIAL MODELING 3© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
