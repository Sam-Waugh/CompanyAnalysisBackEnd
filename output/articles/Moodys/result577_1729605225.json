For example, IFRS 17 has created a requirement for fast, up-front delivery of\nAmericas stochastic scenarios to feed into more time-consuming downstream accounting calculations.\n+1.212.553.1658 Therefore, the ability to streamline the modeling process has become a high priority for many\nclientservices@moodys.com\ninsurers.\nEurope\n+44.20.7772.5454\nMoody’s Analytics offers a set of modeling and analytics capabilities to support all aspects of\nclientservices.emea@moodys.com\nthe process, and as a result can support greater streamlining through tight integration\nAsia (Excluding Japan)\nbetween the tools used for each stage.\n+85 2 2916 1121\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com\nJapan This paper sets out how Moody’s Analytics has integrated our Scenario Generation and\n+81 3 5408 4100 Actuarial Modeling tools, to deliver a solution that allows insurers to run both models,\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com without the need for manual intervention or file conversions. This reduces the operational risk\nthat insurers are otherwise exposed to and the overall runtime of the modeling process; which\nincreases the efficiency and flexibility of the modeling team.\nThe Solutions\nThe AXIS™ actuarial modeling software from Moody’s Analytics is a robust, vendor-\nmaintained system that is ready to use immediately. Offering a single integrated actuarial\nsoftware solution for modeling of insurance and annuity products, the AXIS system has\nunparalleled flexibility. It is widely used by life insurers, reinsurers, and consulting firms around\nthe globe for pricing, reserving, asset and liability management (ALM), financial modeling,\ncapital calculations, and hedging. With more than 30 software releases per year, the AXIS\nsolution is regularly enhanced to exploit new technology and meet evolving regulatory\nstandards and client needs.\nMoody’s Analytics Scenario Generation solutions are compiled from a suite of leading-edge\nstochastic models, software modules, and services that allow insurers and other financial\ninstitutions to undertake a range of risk management activities.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRAT ING SCENARIO GENERATION AND ACTUARIAL MODELS TO ACCELERATE THE MODELING PROCESS 1Integrated functionality\nThe AXIS models make thorough use of scenarios generated by the Scenario Generator to enable economic and other variables to\nbe reflected consistently throughout a range of possible applications. For example, Interest rates and crediting rates in investment\nproducts and funds; Investment and reinvestment asset performance; Calculations of asset values; and Insurance and annuity\nproduct reserves. Our AXIS models can perform both deterministic and stochastic analysis, based on sets of pre-generated or\ndynamically generated scenarios. The projections can incorporate hedging strategies and pricing of derivatives at multiple future\ndates. In addition, reserves or capital calculations using embedded stochastic calculations will reflect the projected economic\nenvironment at a future reporting date.\nFigure 1 illustrates the range of AXIS system processes and objects that are supported by scenarios.\nFigure 1 Uses for Scenarios in AXIS\nThe AXIS system supports the use of static scenario sets. This means scenarios can be generated in advance and imported into the\nsystem, for example if a separate team to the AXIS modeling process owns the scenario generation process. Alternatively, dynamic\nscenario sets are generated on an on-demand basis using a scenario generator.\nFull integration exists between the Moody’s Analytics AXIS system and Scenario Generator solutions, with the flexibility to either:\n» Dynamically generate scenarios within the AXIS system using the Scenario Generator API (application programming interface)\n» Generate scenarios within the Scenario Generator and automatically export them to the AXIS system in the required format.\nMethod 1: Dynamic Scenario Generation within the AXIS system\nTo generate scenarios within the AXIS system, clients can upload a simulation file configured in the Scenario Generator\napplication. This file contains the models required to produce the scenarios for use within the AXIS system and is calibrated to the\nappropriate valuation date being modeled. The AXIS system will parse the simulation file to identify the models contained within\nit. This allows clients to map the models from the simulation file into the markets required for modeling the assets and liabilities\nwithin the AXIS dataset.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING SCENARIO GENERATION AND ACTUARIAL MODELS TO ACCELERATE THE MODELING PROCESS 2Figure 2 Mapping Scenario Generator models in the AXIS system\nThe AXIS system also contains functionality to adjust the calibration of the Scenario Generator simulation. For example, the initial\nyield curve used within the simulation can be updated to reflect the input yield curve. This can be performed for all scenarios or\nonly for scenarios which start at points other than the valuation date, as may be necessary if performing stochastic analysis at a\nfuture projected timestep.\nFigure 3 Scenario Generator Market Model Screen\nClients can specify the number of scenarios to create in the AXIS system. It is also possible to specify the time format of the\nscenarios, and the scenario naming convention as shown in figure 4. These parameters redefine the output file properties to ensure\nthat the scenarios are produced in the correct format for use within the AXIS dataset.\nFigure 4 Scenario Format Options Screen\nThe AXIS system populates the required scenarios from the Scenario Generator through an API. This means that the Scenario\nGenerator works dynamically and passes scenarios to the AXIS system in memory without the need to manually configure or\ninteract with the separate application.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING SCENARIO GENERATION AND ACTUARIAL MODELS TO ACCELERATE THE MODELING PROCESS 3Method 2: Generate scenarios within the Scenario Generator and automatically export them to the AXIS system\nTo generate the scenarios for upload, a configured simulation file should be uploaded in the AXIS system as explained in method 1.\nThe models from the simulation file are mapped to the markets required for modeling the assets and liabilities within the AXIS\ndataset. This then allows clients to export an AXIS mapping file for the required scenario format as shown in figure 5. The mapping\nfile associates each column in an AXIS scenario with a fully qualified output name from the Scenario Generator.\nFigure 5 Exporting a Mapping file\nThe mapping file can then be imported into the Scenario Generator. It will automatically configure all the required outputs and\nconfigure the output file to use the format expected by the AXIS system.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING SCENARIO GENERATION AND ACTUARIAL MODELS TO ACCELERATE THE MODELING PROCESS 4Figure 6 Importing an AXIS system mapping file into the Scenario Generator\nThe Scenario Generator should then be configured to produce the trials and timesteps required by the AXIS dataset and run to\nproduce the scenarios. The Scenario Generator will produce two files for each output file configured to use AXIS outputs. One\ncontaining the single trial historic scenario required within the AXIS system, used to define historic trends of interest rates and\nother economic assumptions. The second output file contains the future scenarios (with values for future timesteps).\nThe AXIS system contains specific processes to automate the import of the scenarios produced by the Scenario Generator. By\nusing these, it automatically matches the columns in the scenarios files to the markets in the relevant AXIS scenario format. This\nallows clients to automatically create the required scenarios and upload the scenario data.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING SCENARIO GENERATION AND ACTUARIAL MODELS TO ACCELERATE THE MODELING PROCESS 5Figure 7 Import flexible format scenarios batch\nConclusion\nThe integration between the AXIS actuarial system and the Scenario Generator greatly simplifies the process of importing\ngenerated scenarios into an insurer’s actuarial model. This applies whether scenarios are created in advance, or on demand while\nthe model is projecting assets and liabilities through a given scenario path. As a result, actuarial modeling teams can respond more\nquickly to requests, running full asset liability projections on an integrated and consistent economic basis. This improves\nperformance and efficiency, requires less overall time to prepare and perform the modeling process, and reduced operational risk\ninherent in manual processes.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING SCENARIO GENERATION AND ACTUARIAL MODELS TO ACCELERATE THE MODELING PROCESS 6© 2022 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
