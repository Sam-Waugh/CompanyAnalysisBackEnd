Data-driven community banks can use\nSr Dir-Product Management data analytics to make informed decisions and more profitably serve their customers and streamline\nAnju Govil their operations. So why are data-driven community banks not the norm?\nDirector-Sr Trainer\nThe main barrier to the adoption of business intelligence (BI for short) by community banks is making\nsense of the overwhelming number of options available for boosting performance. Faced with the\nContact Us\ncomplexity and scale of this data, the top strategic issue for a community bank is how to translate\nAmericas +1.212.553.1653\ndata into action throughout the organization. This article recommends some key considerations for\nEurope +44.20.7772.5454\na community bank on its journey to become a data-driven organization and turn data analysis into\nAsia-Pacific +852.3551.3077\nbottom-line results.\nJapan +81.3.5408.4100\nGetting Started\nCommunity banks can start by understanding best practices for collecting and organizing data. This\nrequires looking under the hood to examine the underlying details, issues, and challenges with today’s\ntools, processes, and frameworks. We can begin by defining the data universe. The data that community\nbanks can use to enhance their profitability includes company financials, qualitative customer data, and\nborrower behavioral data, including payment and credit utilization history. Establishing a centralized\nsystem that captures this unstructured data systematically and consistently is the first step in\nthis process.\nAs banks begin to structure the centralized data, they must ground it in core business principles by\nidentifying which business and operational metrics are critical to the organization. The scope of data\nanalytics will vary with the complexity and sophistication of a bank and its portfolio. Aligning data\npoints to the core strategy will allow banks to correctly structure the data points that have most value\nfor them.\nTo be a data-driven bank, bankers must align these top business goals and priorities with usable and\nactionable insights. This can be accomplished by leveraging insights from the key credit measuresMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nwith a BI tool linked to the bank’s central database. For instance, investment in technology solutions can\nhelp capture, organize, and use data points inside a bank’s processes and help bankers make informed loan\ndecisions faster, identifying new customers or target markets while reducing expenses.\nAlignment and Benchmarking\nEffective strategies ensure that short- and long-term organizational goals are aligned with the bank’s current\nbusiness operations. Partnering with an industry leader with the required data analytics technology and\nimplementation expertise could help the bank capture the right data and integrate it into their processes.\nWhether a bank chooses to partner with a third-party vendor or not, focusing on specific segments under\nthe key data categories is critical for meaningful analysis. We all know that looking at statistics for the\ntotal customer base masks changes in customer behavior, characteristics, and performance. Baseline\ncustomer analytics should, at a minimum, consider new accounts versus the existing customer base to avoid\nconclusions based on customer characteristics and behaviors that may be changing.\nEven data-driven community banks should be wary in aligning internal data with external benchmarks and\nbest practices, because the latter may not be applicable to a particular type of business, product focus,\nmarketplace, or strategic approach. Instead, banks can use internal data to define their own benchmarks and\nmeasure decisions against goals and past performance.\nMonitoring benchmarks via dashboards on an ongoing basis can gauge the current portfolio performance\nagainst peer benchmarking data and historical portfolio performance. Assessing actual performance by\ncomparing historical trends to new profitability, default and recovery metrics (including internal ratings)\nserves as an indicator of improvement. In other words, how would the prior portfolio perform given new tools\nand measures versus actual performance?\nFOR DATA-DRIVEN ANALYTIC INITIATIVES TO BE SUCCESSFUL, LEADERS IN A\nCOMMUNITY BANK NEED TO:\n1. Support investment in systems that centralize data and standardize processes\n2. Reinforce investments with new policy, training, and change management\ninitiatives to ensure adoption\n3. Champion the new systems, programs, and processes and how they contribute to\nthe organization’s success\n2 MARCH 2017 HOW TO BECOME A DATA-DRIVEN BANKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nEstablishing these metrics at the portfolio, customer, or business department level will not only align\nbusiness functions within the organization but also ensure an effective reporting system that is real-time and\nresponsive. Consistent reporting is accomplished by making it easy to filter data and generate reports that\noffer personalized views to manage day-to-day operations and strategic business decisions.\nThe top tactical issues with this approach revolve around collecting, organizing, and ensuring the quality of\nthe data. Maintaining the integrity of analytics requires data that is accurate, comprehensive, and continually\nupdated. The quality of the data is key to realizing the value of BI tools.\nCommunication is Key\nA data-driven approach can mean different things to different people. An objective interpretation would\nrequire alignment of strategy, risk, technology, and operations. Crafting and implementing data analytics and\nsetting goals should be steered by management and approved by the board. This practice can be reinforced\nby communication from senior management to the front lines on the importance of these new systems and\nprocesses to the bank’s success.\nA comprehensive communication strategy should build awareness and set expectations for addressing\nchallenges of individual departments alongside the bank’s strategic goals. An optimal path will offer common\ngoals across the organization, including alignment with short- and long-term goals and transitional phases to\nachieve this change.\nEducating the organization on the value of credit measures, whether risk management back office staff or\nfront office sales professionals, will equip all stakeholders with a solid understanding of these tools and how\nthey support the overall goals of the bank. Operational effectiveness could get a boost from a program to\nprovide support for behavior change, including knowledge of user-friendly software applications. The resulting\ntransparency in the objectives behind data analysis will back up systems with the right support at all levels.\nYou Can’t Go It Alone\nWorking through these challenges alone could be arduous for a bank charting its own course. Community\nbanks can maximize value from their data and analytics by partnering with a vendor that provides tools or\nsolutions built around data quality. If a vendor’s own solutions value high data integrity, the vendor will likely\nhave recommendations on how to use their tools and incorporate check points into the processes to\nprovide validation.\nIn the long run, leveraging advanced data analytics and BI tools is an investment that, if properly\nimplemented, should pay dividends in the form of higher quality, more profitable loans and increased\noperational efficiency for community banks.\n3 MARCH 2017 HOW TO BECOME A DATA-DRIVEN BANKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nHow to Implement Your Data Analytics Strategy\nTactical Issues Operational Areas\n» Data quality and consistency. » Business development and marketing.\nStandardizing processes across the Leveraging customer data to analyze product usage\norganization to capture the required data and customer needs to drive upsell, cross-sell, and\nconsistently on an ongoing basis offer targeting\n» Multiple systems.
