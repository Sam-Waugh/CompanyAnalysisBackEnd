As\na principles-based standard, insurers have several immediate decisions to make in their specific\nContact Us\nimplementation, and such decisions can have a major impact on the timing of reported profit\nAmericas\nand loss.\n+1.212.553.1653\nEurope In a previous paper1, we considered some aspects of profit emergence under IFRS 17, focusing\n+44.20.7772.5454\non the impact of non-financial (longevity) risk on the IFRS 17 balance sheet and income\nAsia-Pacific\nstatement for a group of annuity contracts. In this paper, we turn our attention to financial risk\n+852.3551.3077\nand its impact on contracts with participation features. We focus on two aspects in particular:\nJapan\n(1) differences in profit emergence between the Variable Fee Approach (VFA) and General\n+81.3.5408.4100\nMeasurement Model (GMM), and (2) the impact of risk mitigation. We explore these themes\nusing an illustrative example contract group.\n1 Profit emergence under IFRS 17: Gaining business insight through projection models (Moody’s Analytics whitepaper).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 01CONTENTS\nIntroduction .............................................................................................................................................................................01\nExample product and introduction to the VFA ...............................................................................................................03\nIllustration of the impact of financial risk on P&L over one year ...............................................................................03\nProjection of P&L over the coverage period: Example scenarios ...............................................................................04\nSummary .................................................................................................................................................................................07Example product and introduction to the VFA Illustration of the impact of financial risk on\nP&L over one year\nThe illustrative contract group considered here consists of\n100 contracts, with a coverage period of 10 years and single To illustrate the mechanics of the VFA, and how it compares\npremium of CU (Currency Unit) 150 per policy received to the GMM (General Measurement Model), we consider\nimmediately when the contracts are issued. In return, the the impact of changes in the underlying items on the IFRS 17\ncontract provides the following benefits: balance sheet and P&L.

The hedge assets\n‘direct participation features’. The basic idea of the VFA is that here are designed to delta hedge the entire variable fee i.e.\nthe liability value for such contracts can be considered to be the Cost of Guarantees (COG) and the value of future charges. This\nsum of two components: delta hedge does not provide a perfect hedge of the cost of\nguarantees, with hedge performance deteriorating at extreme\n1. The fair value of the ‘underlying items’3, minus\n(positive or negative) returns on the underlying items.\n2. The value of the entity’s share in the underlying items. In\nFigure 1: Impact of change in underlying items on fair value of assets\nIFRS 17, this component is termed the ‘variable fee’. In the\nminus liabilities\nillustrative example the variable fee can be broken down as:\na. The value of future charges, minus\nb. The cost of guarantees\nUnder the VFA, the impact of financial risk on changes in the\nvalue of liabilities is recognized differently between these\ndifferent components. Changes in fair value of underlying items\nare realized immediately in P&L (Insurance Finance Income or\nExpense). In contrast, changes in the variable fee due to financial\nrisk adjust the CSM (Contractual Service Margin)4, which is\nsubsequently released (as Insurance Service Result) as services\nare provided. This is motivated by the argument that contracts\nwith direct participation features substantially offer investment\nservices, and the variable fee is the entity’s compensation for\nproviding such services.\n2 The contract is based on that described in Example 9 of ‘Illustrative examples on IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts’ (IASB, May 2017) but with modifications to the assumed\ncoverage period, size of annual charges and mortality rates.\n3 Appendix A of IFRS Insurance Contracts (May 2017) defines ‘underlying items’ as ‘Items that determine some of the amounts payable to a policyholder’. In the example\nhere, the fair value of the underlying items is the account balance.\n4 Assuming a CSM exists (i.e. the contract is ‘profitable’). If the contract is onerous, changes in the variable fee are realized immediately in P&L.\n5 In the examples in this Section, liability discount rates and mortality rates at the end of year one are set equal to their forward rates at inception.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 03Figure 2 shows the impact of this change on total year one Interestingly, for a wide range of changes in the underlying items\nprofit, under different IFRS 17 measurement models6. Under (-30% to +30% or so) the overall variability of year one P&L\nthe GMM, the change in the variable fee due to changes in the is similar in size whether the returns on underlying items are\nunderlying items results in immediate P&L (Insurance Finance hedged or not. In both cases, the variability in P&L is far lower\nIncome or Expense). Under the VFA, in the absence of any than the corresponding variability of the entity’s share of the\nrisk mitigation, the change in the variable fee due to changes underlying items. However, the reasons for this lower variability\nin the underlying items adjusts the CSM and is subsequently are different in these two cases. Hedging lowers the economic\nreleased (as Insurance Service Result) in proportion to the impact of changes in the risks being hedged, which translates\nchosen coverage units. In this case, only around 10% of the CSM directly into P&L. In the unhedged case, the lowering of year one\nis released over the first year, resulting in far less variability in P&L variability (relative to the underlying changes in economic\nthe realized P&L as a function of the return on the underlying value) is due to a large proportion of changes in economic value\nitems than under the GMM. Note however that if the underlying being attributed to change in the CSM. These differences are\nitems fall enough, the initial CSM is not large enough to absorb highlighted in Figure 3, which shows the change in CSM as a\nall of the resulting change in the variable fee. In this case, the function of the return on underlying items.\nCSM is set to zero, any excess change in fair value is realized\nFigure 3: Impact of change in underlying items on CSM\nimmediately as a loss, and the contract becomes onerous. In this\nexample, the contract becomes onerous if the underlying items\nfall by 32% or more.\nWhen a risk mitigation strategy is in place, the entity can opt\nto recognize the effect of changes in underlying items (on the\ncomponents of the variable fee being hedged) in P&L rather\nthan adjusting the CSM, subject to certain qualifying criteria7.\nAs the hedge assets will usually be measured under IFRS 9 at\nFair Value through P&L, this option prevents an accounting\nmismatch that would otherwise arise. The orange squares in the\nFigure 2 show the total P&L when the hedge is in place, under\nthe VFA approach (assuming the hedge meets the qualifying\nThe CSM serves to hold back profits (or absorb losses) so that\ncriteria that allows the risk mitigation exception to be applied).\nP&L is released over time. To understand profit emergence\nFigure 2: Impact of change in underlying items on total year one under IFRS 17, and in particular the impact of hedging, we must\nprofit consider how profit emerges not just in year 1 but over the\nentire coverage period.\nProjection of P&L over the coverage period:\nExample scenarios\nIn this section, we consider projections of P&L for the illustrative\ncontract under two example scenarios. One thousand scenarios\nfor liability discount rates and equity fund returns were\ngenerated using the Moody’s Analytics Economic Scenario\nGenerator using a ‘real world’ calibration, and the IFRS 17\nbalance sheet and income statement calculated in each scenario\nat each time step8. The two scenarios analyzed here were\nselected as illustrating particular aspects of profit emergence\nunder the VFA.\n6 We assume that assets are measured under IFRS 9 at Fair Value through P&L. As the fair value of underlying items is also measured at fair value through P&L under IFRS 17\n(under both the GMM and VFA models), these components cancel off in the calculation of net P&L, leaving the effect of the variable fee (plus any hedge assets).\n7 IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (May 2017). Paragraphs B115-116\n8 Note that a (risk-neutral) stochastic model is also required to calculate the Cost of Guarantees in each scenario, at each time-step. In this illustrative example, the contract\nis simple enough that this valuation can be carried out using Black-Scholes formulae.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 04Scenario 1: Volatile returns on underlying items\nIn this scenario, we assume that assets are invested in the underlying items with no hedging, and that assets are measured at fair\nvalue through P&L. The scenario was chosen as one in which the underlying items are relatively volatile over the entire coverage\nperiod.\nFigure 4 shows the underlying fund returns (right axis) and the resulting total profits under the GMM and the VFA.\nFigure 4: Profit pattern under scenario 1\nUnder the GMM, all impact of financial risk is realized immediately in P&L. Volatility in the underlying items therefore translates\ndirectly into volatility in P&L. Under the VFA, changes in the variable fee are smoothed out over time via the mechanism of the CSM,\nrather than being realized immediately as they occur. This smoothing mechanism only operates while the CSM is positive, which\nit is over the entire coverage period in this particular scenario. Although there are relatively large positive and negative returns in\nthis example, there are never enough cumulative negative returns of sufficient size to wipe out the CSM. In particular, the two large\nnegative returns (at years 3 and 6) happen to both be followed by large positive returns. They also happen to occur at time when the\nCSM is relatively large due to previously large positive returns. Figure 5 shows the projected CSM over time in this scenario.\nFigure 5: Projected CSM under scenario 1\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 05Scenario 2: Poor returns resulting in contract becoming onerous\nThis scenario was chosen as one where there are large consecutive falls in the underlying items early in the projection. In this case,\ntotal profits are shown for the VFA only. We compare the case where assets are invested in the underlying items with no hedging, and\nthe case where both the cost of guarantees and the value of future charges are hedged (and the hedge qualifies for the risk mitigation\nexception to be applied).\nIn this scenario, there are consecutive negative returns on underlying items in years 2-5. The large fall of 24% in year 2 is followed by\nan even larger fall of 55% in year 3. In the unhedged case, the CSM at the start of year 3 is not large enough to absorb the impact of\nthis large fall, the contract becomes onerous, and a loss of -577 is immediately realized. In fact, in this scenario, the contract remains\nonerous until the end of the coverage period, so that all subsequent changes in the variable fee result in immediate P&L. In particular,\nthe negative returns in years 4, 5, 7 and 10 all result in realized losses.\nFigure 6: Profit pattern under scenario 2\nIn the hedged case, changes in items being hedged result in immediate P&L rather than adjusting the CSM (assuming qualifying\ncriteria are met). These changes approximately cancel against the corresponding P&L on the hedge assets (with some residual P&L\nreflecting any hedge mismatch) resulting in a far smoother pattern of profit emergence.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 06Many scenarios\nThe scenarios presented in the previous section are just two of many scenarios that might arise in the future. Here we quantify the\ndistributions of P&L using 1,000 stochastic scenarios.\nFirst, we explore the relationship between profits at consecutive years. Previously, we highlighted that the VFA lowers the impact of\nfinancial risk on year 1 P&L using the mechanism of the CSM. To explore further, we plot the total profit realized in year 2 against\nthe total profit released in year 1, in the 1,000 stochastic scenarios. Figure 7 compares P&L in years 1 and 2 using the VFA approach\nwithout any hedging (left chart) and with assets hedging the variable fee (right chart).\nAs noted earlier, the overall variability of P&L in year 1 is similar whether hedged or not. Figure 7 highlights two key differences\nbetween the hedged and unhedged cases:\n1. Without hedging, the distribution of year 1 profits is highly skewed on the downside. Although the CSM serves to dampen the\neffect of poor fund returns on P&L, it can only work so far. If the underlying items fall enough the CSM is extinguished, the contract\nbecomes onerous, and subsequent losses are immediately realized.\n2. In the absence of hedging, year 2 profits are correlated with year 1 profits (and more generally profits exhibit serial correlation), as\nlong as the CSM remains positive. This correlation is due to the CSM mechanism, whereby changes in the variable fee are spread\nout over time. In particular, changes in the variable fee over the first year are partly released as year 1 profit, and partly released as\nyear 2 profit (and partly released in later years).\nFigure 7: Relationship between profits in years 1 and 2\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 07Now consider projection over the entire coverage period. Figure Figure 8: Estimated distribution of projected total profits\n8 shows the estimated distribution of total profits at each future No hedging\nyear over the entire coverage period, under three different asset\nstrategies:\n1. Assets invested in the underlying items with no hedging.\n2. Assets invested in the underlying items, with an overlay to\nhedge the cost of guarantees only.\n3. Assets invested in the underlying items, with an overlay to\nhedge the entire variable fee (cost of guarantees and the\nvalue of charges).\nThe VFA is used in all cases, and the risk mitigation exception\napplied where relevant.\nIn the absence of hedging, we expect profits to increase over\nHedge Cost of Guarantees\ntime on average. This is due to the accumulation of unearned\nprofit over the early years of the projection due to increases in\nthe variable fee, which is subsequently released as service is\nprovided. Although profits are positive throughout time in most\nscenarios, there is a chance of experiencing a loss, corresponding\nto scenarios where the CSM is too small to absorb changes in\nthe variable fee and the contract becomes onerous.\nHedging has the expected effect of reducing uncertainty in\nprofits at each future year, in particular lowering the probability\nof becoming onerous (as part of the change in variable fee is\nhedged, so the CSM has a greater chance of being able to absorb\nany remaining losses).\nIf only the cost of guarantees is hedged, there is still Hedge entire variable fee (Cost of Guarantees and Value of Fees)\nconsiderable variability in the variable fee, primarily due to\nthe value of charges remaining unhedged. And even when the\nentire variable fee is hedged, there is some uncertainty in profits\n(particularly in early years) due to residual hedging errors.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 08As noted earlier, the difference in accounting treatment Figure 9: Distribution of projected cumulative profit\ndepending on whether part or all the variable fee is hedged No hedging\nmeans that the analysis of realized profit over any one year does\nnot give a complete picture of economic profit. For example,\nFigure 8 indicates that the distribution of realized profits over\nthe first year is similar regardless of the hedging strategy.\nHowever, we know from previous analysis that the distribution\nof unearned profits varies considerably, as unhedged changes\nin the variable fee adjust the CSM. In the case where only the\ncost of guarantees is hedged, for example, the hedge is expected\nto smooth variability in economic profit, while the remaining\ncomponent (the value of charges) continues to adjust the CSM\nand is gradually released over time.\nTo understand the true impact of hedging, it is helpful to\nmeasure the distribution of cumulative profit i.e. the sum of Hedge Cost of Guarantees\nP&L realized to date, as shown in Figure 9. In particular, at the\nend of the coverage period, the distribution of cumulative profit\nis independent of accounting treatment and reflects the true\neconomic performance of hedging. Although the variability of\nprofits is smoothed out under the VFA (without hedging), the\naccumulated profit in future years can vary widely depending on\nthe particular economic scenario.\nHedge entire variable fee (Cost of Guarantees and Value of Fees)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: THE VARIABLE FEE APPROACH 09Summary\nThis paper highlights some important aspects of profit emergence for contracts with participation features under IFRS 17, in particular:\n» The Variable Fee Approach and General Measurement Model differ in their treatment of changes in the ‘variable fee’ and whether\nit is realized immediately as P&L (GMM) or amortized via the CSM (VFA). When assets are invested in the underlying items, and\nmeasured at Fair Value through P&L, the resulting economic mismatches between assets and liabilities gives rise to immediate P&L\nunder the GMM. The VFA has the effect of smoothing such economic mismatches over time, so that net profits are (in general) less\nvolatile than under the General Measurement Model.\n» While the CSM absorbs losses due to falls in the variable fee under the VFA, it is floored at zero. When such losses exceed the CSM,\nthe contract is deemed ‘onerous’ and all P&L is immediately realized (as long as the contract remains onerous). Even under the VFA,\nP&L can be relatively volatile depending on the particular economic scenario.\n» The default treatment of the variable fee under the VFA is designed to smooth economic mismatches where these exist, but\nconversely gives rise to an accounting mismatch where assets and liabilities are well matched. When a risk mitigation strategy is\nused (and as long as qualifying criteria are met) certain changes in variable fee can be recognized immediately in P&L rather than\nadjusting the CSM, thus avoiding such accounting mismatches.\n» In the illustrative example analyzed here, the distribution of earned profit over the first year looks similar whether hedged or\nnot, but the distribution of unearned profit (CSM) is different. Hedging lowers P&L variability in year 1 by reducing economic\nmismatches. In contrast, the CSM mechanism lowers P&L variability in year 1 by spreading the effect of economic mismatches over\ntime.\nCONTACT DETAILS\nVisit us at moodysanalytics.com or contact us at a location below.\nAMERICAS EMEA ASIA (EXCLUDING JAPAN) JAPAN\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com clientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\n© 2018 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
