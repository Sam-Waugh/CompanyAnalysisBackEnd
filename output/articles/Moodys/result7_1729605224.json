    "content": "GenAI’s transformative potential\nin the financial sector:\nthe evolution of agents\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved over\nthe past decade, revolutionizing numerous\nindustries with its transformative capabilities. One\nsector where AI’s impact has been particularly\nprofound is financial services, and it has grown more\nthan ever in the last two years with the emergence\nof generative AI (GenAI). However, while some\njumped on the bandwagon and started developing\ninternal and external tools, other companies strug-\ngled with finding use cases or adding the right\ngovernance. In the meantime, the technology keeps\nevolving and now GenAI is moving toward its second\nphase: the rise of agents.\nSergio Gago Huerta\nMD-AI and Quantum ComputingMoody’s saw very early on that this technology would be a game-changer for the financial industry, and since then\nwe have been on a GenAI journey involving creating a set of skills, assistants, and navigators and being the first\nfinancial services company to launch a GenAI tool in the market, the Moody’s Research Assistant. We have also\nbeen busy researching AI agents since we believe they could potentially create a new standard for excellence in\nfinancial analytics.\nBut before diving into Moody’s achievements, it’s essential to grasp what AI agents are and how they differ from\nconventional chatbots.\nTraditional chatbots operate based on predefined rules and scripts. They follow a set of programmed instructions to\nrespond to user queries, often resulting in limited interactions. For instance, if a user asks a rule-based chatbot\nabout a given company rating or financial performance, the chatbot might respond with a predetermined set of\nresponses or direct the user to a specific webpage. These cases leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nframework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with individual companies’ datasets.\nIn Moody’s case, our datasets include decades of research, ratings, articles, and macroeconomic information about\nthe world. RAG is effectively a way of telling the LLM, “We don’t necessarily trust your internal knowledge and the\ndata you have been trained on, so please use this knowledge base I am giving you access to — and by the way,\nplease make sure you provide citations and sources to every claim you make.”\nFigure 1 Moody's Research Assistant provides direct access to the sources used for a given answer — for example,\nthe last rating action for a given company as well as additional details such as financials.\nGenAI’s transformative potential in the financial sector: the evolution of agents 02We have defined four stages of GenAI maturity: assisted intelligence, augmented intelligence, automated\nintelligence, and autonomous intelligence.\n1. Initially, everyone begins with basic chatbots and rudimentary RAG frameworks, which fall under the assisted\nintelligence stage. At this level, AI is basic, prone to hallucinations, and requires extensive human review.\n2. Augmented intelligence brings context-specific capabilities, allowing models to assess implications and\ndetermine the appropriate tools for each situation. This stage can be considered advanced RAG and tool usage, but\nhuman review and decision-making are still necessary.\n3. The next step is automated intelligence, where AI can execute small tasks or make basic recommendations. Here,\nmodels are provided with extensive context, agency, and rules, along with benchmarks and quality controls.\nExamples of such automation include entity or address-matching, data hydration, and anomaly detection. This type\nof automation is similar to what classical machine learning has achieved but is now applicable to a broader domain.\n4. Lastly, autonomous intelligence involves AI's ability to plan, execute those plans, evaluate outcomes, and adapt\naccordingly. This may involve groups of specialized agents contributing their unique perspectives and using different\nskills and multi-modal interaction (vision, voice, and even robotics). At this stage, we are exploring which tasks and\nprojects are suitable. Examples include software development and analyzing a small business’s financials with the\nsame level of scrutiny applied to a Fortune 500 company.\nAI agents are designed to bring us to the last stage of autonomous intelligence. They can handle more complex tasks\nwhere a simple question and answer may not be enough. Some examples could be analyzing financial reports,\ngenerating insights, and even making predictions. The agents can understand nuanced queries, learn from interac-\ntions, and provide tailored responses that evolve over time.\nFigure 2 How agentic workflows really differ from RAG or pure LLM question and answer\nDirect LLM RAG\nContext\nPrompt Answer Prompt Answer\nLLM\nLLM\nGenAI’s transformative potential in the financial sector: the evolution of agents 03Agent\nAction & Tools\nAction & Tools\nLLM\nObjective\nReasoning Action & Tools\nPlan Memory\nFor example, imagine an AI agent designed to assist investors. Unlike a traditional chatbot that might only provide\npredefined sets of information, this AI agent can analyze market trends, interpret financial statements, and offer\npersonalized investment recommendations based on the user’s portfolio and risk tolerance; it can even generate a\nfull report in the user’s desired format. The agent can do that by reasoning and planning in an iterative way, whereas\nthe chatbot would try to write the report in one go from top to bottom. Just like with human workers, the process is\nmore efficient and yields better results when you first create a structure, research the topics, create a first draft, and\nhave a colleague review it and provide ideas or suggestions until you have a final version. That is what agents do.\nNow, imagine several LLM-powered agents that can interact with each other and have different specialties. For\nexample, we could have a credit risk specialist agent; an environmental, social, and governance one; a news analyzer;\nseveral business analysts; and a team of coders that could create software on demand to fetch information or\ngenerate insights. These agents are the equivalent of having an army of assistants working together as a team to\nprovide a solution for a business goal rather than just answering a question.\nMoody’s has been at the forefront of deploying AI agents, leveraging several advanced frameworks to enhance their\nfunctionality. During 2023 we extensively experimented with a multi-agent simulation framework. By the end of 2023\nand going into 2024, we saw fundamental improvements in the technology that could lead us to build enter-\nprise-grade production applications. On one hand, LLMs are getting better, faster, and more accurate.\nGenAI’s transformative potential in the financial sector: the evolution of agents 04On the other hand, agent frameworks are now more efficient and easier to run. Below are three examples of frame-\nworks we currently use and have based our research on:\nAutogen: Autogen is known for its advanced natural language processing capabilities. It allows Moody’s AI\nagents to generate high-quality financial reports and insights by interpreting large volumes of data. For\nexample, Autogen can automatically draft comprehensive credit reports by analyzing financial statements,\nmarket conditions, and other relevant datapoints.\nCrewAI: CrewAI focuses on collaborative AI applications, enhancing interactions between human analysts and\nAI agents. This framework is particularly useful in scenarios where human expertise and AI capabilities need to\ncomplement each other. For instance, CrewAI can assist analysts in identifying emerging market trends by\nanalyzing data patterns and suggesting actionable insights.\nLanggraph: Langgraph is part of the Langchain ecosystem, employs a graph-based system to represent agent\nworkflows, and can be used to analyze complex data relationships. Langgraph can visualize various financial\nindicators’ interconnectedness and predict potential market shifts.\nSome potential use cases where multi-agentic workflows could excel include:\nAutomated credit analysis: Traditionally, credit analysis involves a meticulous review of financial statements,\nmarket conditions, and qualitative factors. Powered by Autogen, Moody’s AI agents streamline this process by\nautomatically generating detailed credit reports. For instance, when assessing a company’s creditworthiness, the AI\nagent analyzes its financial history, industry trends, and economic conditions to produce a comprehensive credit\nassessment. This is especially useful when you want to evaluate smaller private companies for which there is not a\nlot of available data.\nEnhanced risk management: Managing financial risk requires constant monitoring and analysis of market condi-\ntions. Moody’s uses AI agents to predict potential risks by analyzing historical data and market trends. For example,\nan AI agent might forecast potential economic downturns by evaluating indicators such as unemployment rates,\ninterest rates, and geopolitical events. This requires several agents discovering the outliers and how they are\ncorrelated as well as creating different scenarios and outcomes.\nSoftware development/service as a software: Agents can behave like authentic software development squads.\nOne agent can be a project manager, another a quality assurance specialist, another a back-end developer, and\nanother a front-end developer. Examples like Devin are proliferating around the world, and while it is still early days\nfor fully fledged applications, automated agents can safely wield smaller tools. For example, queries like “Find the\ndaily stock prices for the last two years for each ticker in my portfolio” can now be fully automated with a very easy\nand simple query.\nGenAI’s transformative potential in the financial sector: the evolution of agents 05Figure 3 The Autogen framework automatically created a plot for stock market price evolution.\nBelow we have an agent automatically plotting a trading graph with the last two years of stock prices with just one\nsimple, unoptimized prompt — all in about 10 seconds:\nBeneath the surface, the agent built software that connected to the internet, installed the right libraries, downloaded\nthe stock prices, and printed the plot. The industry calls this “service as a software,” as opposed to software as a\nservice (SAAS).\nFigure 4 The actual source code that an agent creates and executes to produce the desired output for the user\nGenAI’s transformative potential in the financial sector: the evolution of agents 06(These screen captures took a few seconds to produce using Autogen Studio, one of the available user interfaces for the Autogen framework.)\nHowever, for more extensive cases in production, agents need to be tamed and their abilities constrained, from\navoiding hallucinations to maintaining alignment with user requirements. Moody’s has put this concept to work in\none of our latest products, ReconAI, which is incorporated in our EDF-X platform. In this product, a collection of\nagents evaluates all the potential metrics that could trigger Early Warning Signals for any company of any size in a\ndynamic and customized way. For example, since we can trigger infinite agents, we can evaluate those Early Warning\nSignals from any public or private company and not just the Fortune 500 organizations that typically get analyzed.\nAnother collection of agents can monitor everything that happens in the world, from news events to controversies to\nmacroeconomic indicators to regulatory filings, and extract the signal on which companies will be affected — all in\nreal time.\nFigure 5 A screenshot of a ReconAI agent evaluating which signals to monitor for specific cybersecurity threats to\na given company\nGenAI’s transformative potential in the financial sector: the evolution of agents 07As a company integrates AI agents into its operations, evaluating their performance and effectiveness is crucial.\nThere are several methods companies can take to help improve agentic-driven solutions’ accuracy and reliability.\nRetrieval-augmented generation evaluation: As previously mentioned, RAG is a framework that combines\ninformation retrieval with generative models. Moody’s uses Ragas, which is an automated evaluation of RAG\nwith LLM as a judge — that is, another LLM is “asked” for the correctness of the answer following an extremely\nspecific scorecard and criteria) among other frameworks to evaluate our AI agents’ performance. This approach\ninvolves using LLM judges to assess the quality of generated content when reference data is unavailable.\nBERTScore, which measures the contextual similarity between two passages, is also applied when reference\ndata is present to provide additional metrics on responses’ relevance and accuracy.\nSearch engine/retrieval performance: AI agents are also evaluated based on their performance in search-\nrelated tasks. Moody’s leverages LLM judges to assess search results’ relevance and AI agents’ effectiveness in\nretrieving relevant information.\nMultiple agent voting/mixture of experts: The last method we use and experiment with is a mixture of agents\nand voting. Foundational models may have biases, system prompts, and guardrails that influence their answers.\nIn some cases, they may be less confrontational. In several of our use cases, we execute the same task through\nseveral models (for example, GPT-4, Claude 2, Llama 3, Gemini, and a Moody’s fine-tuned model) and hold a\nmajority voting decision. Each answer provided by each of the underlying models gets scored and evaluated;\nthis way we increase the accuracy and reduce the hallucination possibilities.\nThis is just the beginning, though. Thanks to having worked on classical machine learning, we had many of the\nbasics covered. But this industry and technology move very fast, especially in benchmarking, which includes some of\nour following research lines:\nSpecialized models: Research is underway to develop specialized models for LLM-as-a-judge, such as\nGoogle’s Cappy and KAIST’s Prometheus 2. These models aim to improve AI judgments’ accuracy and\nconsistency.\nFinancial benchmark datasets: Moody’s is working on creating benchmark datasets to measure LLM\nperformance across different applications. These datasets will help detect performance drift and maintain LLM\nAPI providers’ quality of service.\nComparative studies: Future research will focus on comparing specialized versus general-purpose LLMs for\nevaluation purposes. Developing consistent scoring mechanisms for LLM judges is also a priority to enhance\nevaluation reliability.\nAs Moody’s continues to lead the way in AI agent technology, several trends and developments are shaping the\nfuture of financial services, including increasing automation and depth (i.e., applying the same analysis to every\ncompany regardless of its size), enhanced personalization and contextualization, and greater integration across\nfinancial systems.\nGenAI’s transformative potential in the financial sector: the evolution of agents 08Critical technical components are in place to be leveraged by RAG and Tuning approaches\n01 02 03 04 05\nData interoperability Entity resolution Data lineage and trust API architecture Permissions and\nentitlements\nWhat do you have on That's not what I meant.

It is paramount that AI systems operate reliably and ethically.\nThis involves implementing robust safety protocols, continuous monitoring, and rigorous testing to prevent\nunintended consequences. By prioritizing AI safety, we can build trust and confidence in AI technologies and make\nsure they are used responsibly and beneficially.\nMoody’s journey in adopting and Even though the technology had been around for several\ndeploying AI agents exemplifies years, 2022 saw the birth of GenAI, while 2023 was the\nyear of RAG.
