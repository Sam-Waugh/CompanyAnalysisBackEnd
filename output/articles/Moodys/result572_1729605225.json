For example, In October 2021 the Bank\nof England released its updated Climate Change Adaptation Report 20211 which included the UK’s Prudential Regulation\nAuthority’s (PRA) planned move in 2022 from assessing the implementation of its climate-related supervisory expectations to\nactively supervising against them. Some countries started mandating climate risk disclosures, for example France with Article 173-\nVI in 2016, pressure has been growing for voluntary disclosure of the impact of climate change risk on an Insurers business. The\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TFCD) recommendations, aim to provide data that enables better investment,\ncredit, and underwriting decisions. There is now a move towards mandatory disclosure in many jurisdictions including the UK, New\nZealand, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil, EU, Singapore, Switzerland. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nhas recently proposed rule changes to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures for investors.\nAn insurer’s Risk Management strategy must evolve to address emerging physical and transition risks. Insurers need to be able to\ntranslate climate risk into financial metrics to measure the financial impact across market, credit, liquidity, and insurance risk.\nReputation Risk, with a range of stakeholders, is becoming a key issue for insurers as they and their competitors commit to net\nzero strategies. Insurers who rise to these challenges can thrive and even access new revenue streams.\nTo address climate risk in a comprehensive way, insurers need to adopt an integrated approach to managing a range of emerging\ndirect and indirect risks across the entire business, considering both sides of the balance sheet.\nIntegrated ESG-C Risk Assessment Framework for Insurers\nClimate and ESG touch every part of an insurer: from its impact on the business itself, to the entities it either invests in or insures,\nthrough to the total value chain making up its operations. Many of these elements are inter-related, and this adds to the overall\ncomplexity when it comes to identifying, measuring, managing, and reporting on total ESG-C.\nTo help insurers meet this challenge, and based on extensive customer engagement across the globe, Moody’s has developed an\nintegrated ESG-C framework for insurers. Rather than presenting Moody’s capabilities in the ESG-C space, this is intended to\nprovide a clear picture of the different elements, either individually or collectively, that insurers need to address in a\ncomprehensive, integrated plan of action to achieve net zero.\nFigure 1 The integrated ESG-C Risk Assessment Framework\n1 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/publication/2021/october/climate-change-adaptation-report-\n2021.pdf?la=en&hash=FF4A0C618471462E10BC704D4AA58727EC8F8720\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE CHANGE – THE BIGGEST RISK MULTIPLIER FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2Starting at the top\nA truly integrated approach starts with the Board defining the Net Zero strategy. Insurers will need to ensure that these senior\nleaders have the requisite knowledge and understanding around ESG and climate risk to make such decisions. This includes signing\noff the commitments to meet specific temperature and emission targets that contribute to a low carbon economy and defining\ntheir sustainability policy and risk appetite. As part of this process, the executive management team will need to set out interim\nmilestones, the timeline for meeting these targets, and determine how the business will operate to fulfill the stated commitments.\nThere is clear reputational risk at play here once a firm commits to and is transparent about its Net Zero goal and strategy. But\nthere is also potential for a positive impact on reputation with a wide group of stakeholders.\nTo meet the newly adopted ESG-C corporate objectives, insurers need to develop climate-aware business and financial plans,\nincluding:\n» Setting out management actions over short, medium, and long-term time horizons allowing for potential transition paths and\nphysical risk exposures.\n» Assessing how the business mix might change given different climate risk exposures.\n» For listed insurers, considering the possible effect on dividend policy.\n» Looking at implications for corporate mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.\nImplementing and maintaining a business plan capable of evolving with real-world developments depends on the availability of\nflexible forward-looking scenarios. These are crucial to enable the financial planning and analysis teams to project the balance\nsheet and P&L under a range of climate narratives and time horizons.\nUnderstanding the financial impact of Climate and ESG Risk\nFor insurers, understanding the financial impact of climate risk over different time horizons on both sides of the balance sheet is\ncritical. In the short term, the impact from physical risk exposures and market re-pricing dynamics on the asset portfolio is key but\nover the medium to long term, firms also need to understand the impact of different transition paths and physical damage\nmodels.\nSophisticated scenario analysis is needed to understand the financial impact of climate risk which empowers executives’ decision-\nmaking and provides insight for business and financial planning. It also informs the priorities of the core operating units’ strategies,\nincluding investment, risk, capital and liquidity, underwriting and reinsurance, as well as the product design and marketing. This\nenables the business has a consistent view of the financial impact required to achieve the firm’s Net Zero and sustainability\ntargets.\nThis understanding is vital for all areas of an insurer’s risk management strategy, its reputational risk management, and regulatory\ncompliance as well as providing the opportunity to develop new revenue streams.\nRead Constructing Climate Pathway Scenarios to Assess the Financial Impact of Climate Risk to find out more.\nInvestment Strategy\nInsurers have been incorporating ESG factors into their investment strategy and portfolio management for some time. This can be\nenhanced for climate risk by taking several steps including:\n» Assessing current portfolios in terms of financial impact, current temperature and carbon footprint, ESG-C risk exposures and\nwhether they hold any stranded assets.\n» Considering how the business mix might change given different climate risk exposures.\n» Determining the required investment glidepath in terms of the organization’s Net Zero timeline, temperature, and emission\ntargets and screen available assets against the appropriate ESG criteria.\n» Considering portfolio construction and how best to implement climate-aware strategic asset allocation.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE CHANGE – THE BIGGEST RISK MULTIPLIER FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 3However, sourcing reliable and consistent data to support ESG risk assessment for both public and private assets is a challenge and\nincorporating carbon emission and temperature targets, together with different climate narratives into the optimization process of\nthe portfolio construction is complex.\nInsurers who have committed to the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) goal of driving significant and real\nprogress towards a Net Zero and resilient future by 2030 will need to ensure their investment strategy aligns with the IIGCC\nprinciples.\nRead Incorporating Climate Risk into Strategic Asset Allocation to find out more\nRisk Strategy\nInsurers need to understand climate risk in terms of physical and transition risk exposures and the climate risks on their assets and\nliabilities. Once these risks are identified, they can be measured by translating the impact onto existing risk exposures and\nrelationships (such as, market, credit, liquidity, insurance, reputational, liability, and operational risk). The organization’s risk\nstrategy can then evolve to include mitigation plans given the new exposures, new interactions and ongoing monitoring for\nemerging risks identified as well as potential new threats on the horizon.\nRead Climate aware Own Risk Solvency Assessment to find out more\nCapital and Liquidity Strategy\nInsurers need to consider potential impacts of climate risk on their existing:\n» Economic, regulatory, and rating-based capital\n» Capital position as part of regulatory stress tests\n» Capital adequacy and reserving under a range of physical and transition paths.\nA select group of UK insurers have recently gained experience of regulatory stress tests through the Bank of England CBES exercise.\nThe objective of this exercise was two-fold: first to quantify the risks to the firms’ current balance sheets under three climate\nscenarios capturing physical, transition and litigation risk, and second to assess how the firms would change their business models\nin response to the risks presented in each scenario.\nUnderwriting Strategy\nESG is fast becoming a key factor in delivering positive underwriting results and a source of competitive advantage, particularly for\nthe corporate P&C industry. The growing number of insurers who are signatories to the Net Zero Insurance Alliance will also need\nto set independent underwriting criteria and guidelines aligned with a 1.5pc Net Zero transition pathway\nThese strategies are all important parts of an insurers overall risk strategy as well as crucial for addressing regulatory challenges.\nRead Incorporating ESG into P&C underwriting to find out more\nProduct Design and Marketing\nOpportunity exists for product innovation, and therefore new revenues, for insurers placing climate risk management at the heart\nof their business. This could take the form of products which include the impact of climate change as well as new pricing\nstrategies. Marketing can boost an insurer’s reputation with a multitude of its stakeholders.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE CHANGE – THE BIGGEST RISK MULTIPLIER FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 4Supply Chain Management\nInsurers and their customers need to consider the impact of climate risk throughout their value chain. This includes assessing the\nESG performance of their suppliers to form a comprehensive view of their exposure to ESG risk. Furthermore, the ability to extend\nthis view to the network of suppliers (i.e. fourth party relationships or their suppliers) insurers and their customers are exposed to\nindirectly can help manage business interruptions risks that might arise.\nMonitoring performance and risk exposure\nEffective monitoring is critical to building a robust business plan and strategy. Insurers need to ensure they have appropriate KPIs,\nmetrics, and scorecards in place to achieve this, as well as the capability to act on the results.\nGovernance & Compliance\nUnderpinning each component of the integrated risk assessment framework is the need for the appropriate level of governance\nand compliance. These are vital to support the implementation and validation of core modeling processes required for identifying,\nquantifying, and monitoring ESG and climate risks and their impact across key business functions.\nThe volume of data and complexity of metrics involved presents operational challenges. A streamlined approach to collation and\naggregation is required not only to meet disclosure deadlines but also provide drill down capability for auditing and valuation.\nAmong other things, at stake is the reputational risk of the business if it is found to be falling short of its stated Net Zero goals.\nFulfill reporting and disclosure requirements\nReporting is the final, vital piece of the puzzle. Insurers’ reporting requirements will only grow with reports for shareholders, policy\nholders, industry groups, ratings agencies, and regulators becoming standard. Insurers need to be able to convert their climate risk\nstrategy and framework into these outputs consistently and with ease and confidence.\nBuilding a sustainable business and future\nClimate risk remains a top priority for insurers today, but a practical and forward-thinking approach based on a comprehensive risk\nassessment framework shows that it is possible to incorporate climate risk management into the heart of the business. Models,\ndata, and tools will continue to evolve but insurers should not delay making a start. A flexible, iterative approach can tackle an\norganization’s key priorities first and ensure consistency across each element of the framework. This is vital for complying with\nregulatory requirements and protecting against reputation risk, particularly after public commitments to net zero. Climate risk is\narguably the biggest challenge for insurers today but those that seize the initiative and embrace this challenge can build a\nsustainable and resilient but also thriving business model for 2022 and beyond.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE CHANGE – THE BIGGEST RISK MULTIPLIER FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 5© 2 022 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
