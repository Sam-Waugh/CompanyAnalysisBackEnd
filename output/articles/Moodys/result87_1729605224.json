We performed this analysis by running firms’ financial statements through default risk models and comparing the\nfollowing risk measures:\n1. COVID-19 point-in-time (PIT) probability of default (PD). This point-in-time probability of default risk measure includes\nthe economic stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic and oil price shocks per the as-of date for this analysis.\n2. Through-the-cycle (TTC) PD. This measure captures the risk level associated with firms’ financial ratios without any\nconsideration of prevailing credit cycle conditions.\nWe compare these measures to evaluate how COVID-19 point-in-time probability of default measures exceed through-the-cycle\nprobability of default measures (TTC PD vs COVID-19 PD). We perform this analysis at an industry level and at the risk-band level\nwithin industries to identify which industries COVID-19 affects most and with what magnitude. We do not stress financials for\nindividual firms because we expect that market reactions captured by the PIT PD reflect potential future changes in financials.\nData\nThe large firm sample includes 10,000 private and public firms. Over 90% of the firms are in the United States, and the rest of the\nfirms are in Canada.\nExhibit 1 shows the distribution of firms by industry on the left and by total asset size on the right. Services, Trade, and Business\nProducts are the most-represented industries in the sample though borrowers in the data span all the industry sectors in the\nmodel. The Unassigned sector is for firms that either do not have an industry identifier or are in an industry that does not map to\nthe RiskCalc™ model’s sectors. Total asset size for this sample has a lower boundary of $100 million.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON NORTH AMERICA LARGE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n3Exhibit 1 Industry and size distribution for firms in the COVID-19 exercise sample\nSource: Moody’s Analytics Data Alliance\nAnalysis and results\nMethodology\nThe analysis measures the impact of COVID-19 and the oil price shocks on default risk for borrowers. Our model uses financial\nstatement data and associated default observations on historical data samples with defining characteristics similar to those of the\ndata samples used in this exercise. We evaluate firms by their PD measure. The model produces through-the-cycle default risk\nmeasures using only firms’ financial statements without any consideration of the prevailing credit cycle conditions. It also\nproduces point-in-time default risk measures that account for the credit cycle by translating public equity market signals. The\nmodel also translates PD into a PD-implied rating.1\nWe compare these measures to evaluate how COVID-19 has changed point-in-time probability of default measures from\nthrough-the-cycle levels. We perform this analysis at an industry level and at the risk-band level within industries.\nResults\nAgriculture and Consumer Products see the greatest increase in risk\nTo measure the impact of recent events by rating grade, in Exhibit 2 we take a firm whose financial ratios imply a TTC PD rating of\nBaa2 (~0.35% PD) and apply the COVID-19 credit cycle adjustment of each industry to see how recent developments affect\ndefault probability at different starting risk levels. The unadjusted PIT PD shows how the credit cycle at the end of February affects\nratings. By the end of February, many sectors already began to reflect credit negative pressure while some sectors remained more\nresilient, such as Utilities. We now see all industries are punitively affected by the current pandemic. Agriculture supplants\nConsumer Products from our previous study2 as the sector with the highest average COVID-19 PIT PD. Utilities and Mining remain\nnear the bottom of the list in terms of magnitude.\nThe table on the right in Exhibit 2 measures the PD movement for each sector from the TTC to the COVID-19 PIT PD. Users can\napply this percentage change to their TTC PD to approximate the impact of the coronavirus on their portfolio. For example, if you\nhave an agriculture firm that has a risk profile similar to a Baa2 risk rating with a TTC PD of 0.35%, you can multiply that 0.35%\nTTC PD by (1 + 109%) to get a point-in-time default risk measure of 0.73% that incorporates the coronavirus credit cycle stressors.\n1 The PD-implied or EDF-implied rating is generally consistent with the default rates of bond ratings as measured by Moody’s Investors Service Default Studies.\n2 https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1222395\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON NORTH AMERICA LARGE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n4Appendix II: Expected Movements in PIT PD Due to COVID-19 presents tables with percentage change adjustments for each\nindustry and implied-rating grade combination.\nExhibit 2 Change from the TTC PD to the COVID-19 PIT PD by industry for Baa2 firms\n% CHANGE TTC TO\nGRADE: BAA2 COVID-19 PIT\nAgriculture 109%\nBusiness Products 93%\nBusiness Services 89%\nCommunication 78%\nConstruction 70%\nConsumer Products 101%\nHealth Care 48%\nHiTech 53%\nMining 42%\nServices 90%\nTrade 94%\nTransportation 75%\nUnassigned 76%\nUtilities 31%\nImpact on expected losses\nTo assess potential impacts on expected losses, we assume a constant loss given default (LGD) of 50% and multiply it by our\nmonthly weighted average PIT PDs. Exhibit 3 charts the weighted average expected loss rates beginning in January 2019 through\nApril 7, 2020. The final datapoint shows the COVID-19 PIT PD based on the latest credit cycle information. We see expected loss\nrates increase by roughly 68% since the onset of COVID-19. This is down from nearly 80% in our prior study.\nExhibit 3 Progression of expected loss rates\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON NORTH AMERICA LARGE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n5Conclusion\nThe global coronavirus contagion and the drop in oil prices has shocked firms across all sectors and sizes. Month-over-month, we\ntypically do not expect many PIT risk rating grade changes—and if there are changes, they are usually not more than a one-rating\ngrade upgrade or downgrade. Exhibit 4 illustrates that COVID-19 and oil price shocks have, in general, downgraded borrowers by\none or two rating grades across sectors and firm sizes. Roughly 30% of borrowers see no rating grade impact, up from 10% in our\nprior study. More than 65% see a one-grade downgrade and roughly 5% see a two or more grade downgrade versus roughly 30%\nfrom our prior study.3\nAlthough all industries are negatively affected, Agriculture and Consumer Products see the greatest increase in risk from TTC PD.\nThe previously hardest-hit industries are showing some recovery in the COVID-19 PIT PD while the previously more resilient\nindustries are maintaining their credit negative levels in the COVID-19 PIT PD. We continue to watch for the latest public market\ndata that may influence the PIT PD.\nExhibit 4 Change in implied ratings due to the COVID-19 PIT PD (all downgrades)\n3 https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1222395\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON NORTH AMERICA LARGE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n6Appendixes\nAppendix I: Credit Cycle Adjustment Overview\nThe credit cycle adjustment (CCA) model produces our PIT risk measures. It accounts for the credit cycle by combining the\ndistance-to-default (DD). DD factors for a given month are obtained in the beginning of the next month. Data goes through\nquality checks and additional transformations to be released in the CCA for the following month.\nExhibit 5 illustrates the progression of the through-the-cycle default risk measure through our financial statement only (FSO)\nmodel (TTC PD model) before applying the adjustment to produce the point-in-time CCA default risk measure. The CCA model\ndemonstrates how the current market signals compare to historical market signals. If the current credit environment is better than\nthe historical average, we adjust the FSO EDF™ (Expected Default Frequency) down to arrive at a less risky CCA EDF. If the current\ncredit environment is worse than the historical average, we adjust the FSO EDF up to arrive at a riskier CCA EDF. EDF is Moody’s\nAnalytics nomenclature for probability of default.\nExhibit 5 Illustrative progression of the CCA model\nAppendix II: Expected Movements in PIT PD Due to COVID-19\nChange in EDF from the FSO to the COVID-19 CCA EDF\nExhibit 6 identifies the expected change in CCA EDF (PIT PD) relative to the FSO EDF (TTC PD) when using the latest credit market\nsignals per this study’s as-of date.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON NORTH AMERICA LARGE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n7Exhibit 6 Change in PD from the TTC to the COVID-19 PIT PD\nSECTOR A1 A2 A3 BAA1 BAA2 BAA3 BA1 BA2 BA3 B1 B2 B3 CAA/C\nBusiness Products 48% 113% 114% 66% 54% 51% 71% 89% 95% 73% 73% 90% 143%\nHiTech 25% 67% 60% 39% 35% 35% 35% 53% 67% 36% 41% 42% 79%\nConstruction 34% 94% 81% 52% 45% 40% 50% 70% 75% 51% 51% 60% 102%\nCommunication 40% 109% 98% 62% 49% 43% 59% 78% 80% 61% 60% 72% 119%\nTrade 54% 117% 120% 68% 58% 60% 73% 94% 106% 79% 82% 102% 161%\nServices 50% 114% 118% 67% 56% 54% 72% 90% 99% 75% 76% 94% 149%\nMining 20% 58% 54% 37% 27% 31% 26% 42% 52% 34% 36% 31% 67%\nUnassigned 38% 107% 94% 61% 48% 42% 57% 76% 78% 59% 57% 69% 114%\nConsumer Products 62% 135% 124% 71% 63% 72% 76% 101% 112% 88% 83% 118% 183%\nAuto 53% 115% 120% 68% 57% 57% 72% 93% 103% 78% 79% 99% 156%\nHealth 23% 63% 58% 38% 32% 34% 31% 48% 61% 35% 39% 38% 74%\nAgriculture 63% 142% 125% 72% 66% 77% 81% 109% 113% 91% 84% 124% 192%\nTransportation 37% 105% 92% 60% 48% 42% 56% 75% 78% 58% 57% 68% 113%\nUtilities 16% 48% 41% 35% 20% 26% 17% 31% 32% 32% 29% 24% 53%\nExhibit 7 presents the change in five-year EDF (PD) that represents the longer-run impact of COVID-19 relative to the FSO EDF\n(TTC PD) when using the latest credit market signals per this study’s as-of date.\nExhibit 7 Change in PD from the TTC to the COVID-19 PIT PD\nSECTOR A1 A2 A3 BAA1 BAA2 BAA3 BA1 BA2 BA3 B1 B2 B3 CAA/C\nBusiness Products 22% 36% 43% 37% 54% 86% 89% 91% 70% 50% 39% 47% 49%\nHiTech 17% 21% 29% 24% 31% 58% 54% 49% 48% 38% 24% 29% 31%\nConstruction 19% 24% 37% 27% 43% 75% 75% 70% 58% 43% 29% 36% 38%\nCommunication 20% 28% 41% 30% 46% 80% 85% 81% 64% 45% 33% 40% 42%\nTrade 23% 42% 44% 43% 62% 98% 95% 96% 74% 53% 43% 51% 55%\nServices 22% 38% 43% 39% 57% 90% 91% 93% 71% 51% 40% 48% 51%\nMining 14% 19% 24% 22% 23% 47% 48% 41% 42% 31% 21% 25% 27%\nUnassigned 20% 26% 40% 29% 45% 79% 84% 79% 62% 45% 32% 39% 41%\nConsumer Products 25% 47% 51% 51% 74% 110% 104% 101% 83% 58% 47% 57% 62%\nAuto 23% 40% 43% 42% 60% 95% 93% 95% 73% 53% 42% 50% 53%\nHealth 16% 20% 27% 23% 27% 54% 51% 46% 46% 35% 23% 28% 29%\nAgriculture 25% 49% 54% 55% 80% 114% 109% 103% 87% 59% 49% 59% 65%\nTransportation 20% 26% 40% 28% 45% 79% 84% 78% 61% 44% 32% 39% 40%\nUtilities 12% 16% 19% 17% 16% 34% 37% 33% 36% 23% 17% 19% 21%\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON NORTH AMERICA LARGE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n8Appendix III: Average Probability of Default by Rating Grade\nExhibit 8 presents the average EDF (or PD) by rating grade.\nExhibit 8 Average PD by rating grade\nRATING AVERAGE PD\nAaa 0.01%\nAa1 0.02%\nAa2 0.04%\nAa3 0.07%\nA1 0.11%\nA2 0.16%\nA3 0.20%\nBaa1 0.25%\nBaa2 0.35%\nBaa3 0.53%\nBa1 0.85%\nBa2 1.35%\nBa3 2.02%\nB1 3.03%\nB2 4.55%\nB3 6.82%\nCaa/C 17.10%\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON NORTH AMERICA LARGE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n9© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
