More important, the CPI for energy\noccur.\nservices fell 1.7%, reversing a good chunk of its 2.1% gain in\nJanuary. February’s drop in the CPI for energy services was\nattributable to an 8% decline in the CPI for utility gas\nservice. In January, natural gas bills were down or only\nslightly up in all U.S. census regions except the West, where\nthey surged 37.1% on a not seasonally adjusted basis. In the\nfirst month of 2023, Southern California Gas Co. and San\nDiego Gas & Electric implemented new natural gas and\nelectric rates that were up by more than double from a year\nearlier. However, this sharp increase in the CPI for utility gas\nservice was never going to repeat itself, with wholesale\nnatural gas prices down on a year-to-date basis. Indeed,\nFebruary’s CPI for utility gas service plunged 21.1% in the\nWest and was appreciably lower in the other three census\nregions.\nCore goods prices were unchanged in February after rising\n0.1% in the prior month, but there was a major surprise\nwithin this category of the core CPI. Used-vehicle prices fell\n2.8% in February on the heels of declines of about 2% in\nthe preceding four months. We did not expect the monthly\ndeclines in used-vehicle prices to have intensified last\nmonth, because wholesale used-car prices, which typically\nlead retail prices by a few months, have steadily risen since\nNovember and rose 4.3% in February, the largest increase\nfor the month of February since 2009, according\nto Manheim Consulting.

As a result, we are also paying close\nattention to the CPI for core services excluding shelter,\nwhich—unlike the CPI for rent of shelter—is not guaranteed\nto come down on its own. We estimate the CPI for core\nservices excluding shelter has decelerated from 6.7% in\nSeptember to 6.1% in February on a year-ago basis. This is\nstill too strong a pace for the Fed to stomach.\nMoreover, wage growth in industries relevant to the CPI for\ncore services excluding shelter is running at an estimated\n5.3% year-over-year pace, faster than at any other point\nprior to the pandemic.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH / WEEKLY MARKET OUTLOOK 5The Week Ahead in the Global Economy\nU.S. spending.
