Regulatory scrutiny brings challenges that have \nsignificant implications for CRE professionals across various functions, \nincluding operations, risk management, and forecasting.\nThis report outlines the current state of the regulatory environment, \nincluding the challenges banks with high CRE concentration face, and how \nMoody’s CRE solutions can help decode and address these nuances. \n5\nIn the wake of change: \nmarket adaptions and \nregulatory reactions \nThe economic trajectory following the Covid-19 pandemic serves as a \nreminder that consumer behavior and market conditions are always \nevolving. What’s more, many of the loans for these properties will \napproach maturity in the coming years.\nThe Federal Reserve published a report showcasing the latter half of \n2023, when large banks saw a substantial increase in loan delinquency \nrates, particularly among the Office sector. Additionally, very low \ntransaction volume has limited price discovery. As a result, lenders have \nbecome more reliant on appraised values, creating concern that \ncollateral values may be overstated.\nA POST-PANDEMIC HISTORY\n6\nReevaluation of \nregulatory practices\nSignature Bank’s, Silicon Valley Bank’s, and First \nRepublic Bank’s collapse in spring 2023 was largely \ncaused by liquidity constraints and led to a paradigm \nshift in the regulatory environment. Regulatory agencies, \nincluding the Federal Reserve, bore the brunt of the \nblame, with critics arguing that the agency failed to \nimplement sufficiently rigorous stress tests on bank \nbalance sheets, especially given the rising interest rates \nand prolonged yield curve inversion. \nAgencies are concerned that institutions with \nconcentrated CRE exposures are particularly vulnerable \nduring downturns. As a result, regulators have begun to \nenforce stricter rules and guidelines. Lenders and \nborrowers face the complex task of evaluating how \npotential increases in their debt service obligations under \nvarious adverse scenarios would affect their financial \nstability.\n7\nToday’s regulatory landscape\nANALYZING PROACTIVE MEASURES FROM REGULATORS\nRegulators are aware of commercial real estate’s traditionally cyclical nature– particularly how the \nlows can provide some of the greatest risks to banks due to loan defaults and losses. \nAgencies including the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \n(FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have been on high alert since the \npandemic, honing in on CRE due to its susceptibility to market volatility and external factors. \nSource: NYCB Announcement Foreshadows Trouble to Come in 2024, but CRE-Related Downside Has Limits\nShare of Bank Total Assets\nBank Category\nMultifamily \nCRE Loans\nCommercial \nCRE Loans\nFunded CRE \nConstruction Loans\nTotal Direct \nCRE Exposure\nFed \"Large\" Banks\n(25 banks,>$160B total assets)\n1.4%\n2.1%\n0.8%\n4.4%\nRegional Banks\n(133 banks, $19-160B total assets)\n4.8%\n8.9%\n4.0%\n17.8%\nCommunity Banks\n(849 banks, $1-10B total assets)\n6.0%\n14.0%\n5.8%\n25.7%\nSmall Banks\n(2,890 banks, $100mm-1B total assets)\n3.1%\n10.3%\n5.3%\n18.7%\nSmall Banks\n(726 banks, <$100mm total assets)\n0.9%\n3.9%\n2.5%\n7.3%\nNYCB\n33.9%\n6.7%\n2.8%\n43.4%\n8\nNavigating increased regulatory \nscrutiny\nChallenges of enhanced regulatory oversight \nTHE CRITICAL ROLE OF ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES AND COMPREHENSIVE STRESS TESTING\nBanks operating in the CRE space face heightened scrutiny, increasing the need for \ncomprehensive loan-level stress testing. A regulatory examination’s level of intensity varies \nbased on the bank’s size and the threat of perceived risks within its CRE portfolio. \nTherefore, having an ongoing strategy to adapt to internal and external changes is \nparamount for all banks with commercial real estate in their books. \nMandated stress tests for CRE loans are designed to assess their resilience. By evaluating \nhow different occupancy levels and rental rates affect these loans, the tests determine if \nbanks can endure challenging scenarios, including unprecedented headwinds and high \ninterest rates. Economic conditions change every year, prompting regulators to adjust their \ntesting criteria accordingly. The dynamic nature of these tests presents a persistent \nchallenge for banks striving to demonstrate their financial stability.\n9\nBanks with large CRE portfolios must understand how interest rate fluctuations \nimpact their mortgage valuations. This uncovers insights that enable them to \nstrategically manage and mitigate future market volatility impacts.\n10\nPreparing for regulatory \nchallenges\nRegulatory frameworks and \nrisk assessment in banking\n11\nState and federal regulators engage with banks on a periodic basis, \ntypically every 12-18 months, employing the Uniform Financial institution \nRating System (often referred to as CAMELS) to evaluate banks' health \nacross various dimensions; meanwhile, other institutions are evaluated \nusing the RFI rating system. The CAMELS and RFI rating systems are \nmeasured from 1 (strongest) to 5 (weakest), indicating the level of \nperformance.\nThe current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology updates the US \naccounting rules’ generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to \nbetter predict losses from loans and other assets. It uses past data loss, \nfuture financial predictions, and the current economy to make these \nestimates, replacing the old method that waited for losses to happen first.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) is an estimation of the \nprobable net charge-offs (the amount of loans expected not to be repaid) \nand serves to adjust the value of the loan portfolio reported on the balance \nsheet to adjust for expected loss.\nThe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is an annual \nassessment that helps major financial institutions maintain a forward-\nlooking and resilient capital planning process tailored to their specific risks.\nCAMELS: Capital adequacy, asset quality, management, \nearnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk\nCECL: an accounting standard introduced by the Federal \nReserve to estimate allowances for credit losses\nALLL: an accounting estimate that represents the acceptable \namount to cover potential credit losses in a loan portfolio\nRFI: Risk management, financial condition, and the Impact of \nthe non-depository entities on the subsidiary depository \ninstitutions\nCCAR: is the Federal Reserve stress test for large US banks \nto evaluate their capital adequacy and risk management \nunder economic shocks\nNavigating the regulatory review process\nIT IS CRUCIAL THAT BANKS ENGAGE IN PROACTIVE DIALOGUE with \nregulators during the review process while also maintaining a paper trail to \ndemonstrate compliance and ongoing efforts to mitigate identified risks. To \nadapt to regulatory agencies’ evolving demands, banks must conduct \nthorough reviews of their past year’s regulatory evaluations, focusing on the \nidentified deficiencies and what measures they took to address them.\n12\nSee slide 5 for instructions on how to update footer\n13\nFDIC CRE regulatory oversight\nAdopting strategic measures for stability in \nvolatile markets\nThe FDIC’s December 2023 financial institution Letter, Managing \nCommercial Real Estate Concentrations in a Challenging Economic \nEnvironment is based on a version from 2008 when the market was \ndeep in the throes of the financial crisis. The FDIC urges banks to \nregularly analyze the collectability of their exposures; this involves \nassessing the probability of repayment for issued loans.\nAdditionally, the FDIC strongly recommends that banks diversify their \nfunding sources, incorporating a blend of retail deposits, wholesale \nfunding, and various financial instruments. It’s also crucial for banks to \nmanage their reserves effectively by allocating capital to cushion \nagainst potential loan defaults. Stress testing is also advised. By \nmodeling various adverse economic conditions, banks can gauge \npotential impacts on their loan portfolios.\nFDIC’S SIX KEY RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES FOR BANKS WITH CRE CONCENTRATIONS\n14\n1\nMaintain strong capital levels\n•\nCapital maintenance is crucial for institutions to safeguard against unexpected losses, particularly in stressed markets.\n•\ninstitutions with significant exposures to construction and development (C&D) and commercial real estate should hold additional capital as \na proactive measure.\n2\nEnsure that credit loss allowances \nare appropriate\n•\nAllowances for credit loss (ACL) must comply with GAAP, reporting instructions, supervisory guidance, and management’s best judgment.\n•\nCredit losses for both individually assessed loans and the remaining loan portfolio should be addressed. \n•\nGAAP mandates use of historical data and supportable forecasts to assess loan collectability and determine credit loss.\n3\nManage construction and \ndevelopment (C&D) and CRE \nloan portfolios closely\n•\nParts 364-365 of the FDIC rules and regulations highlight the need for institutions to manage the higher risks associated with significant \nC&C and CRE concentrations.\n•\nInstitutions must have information systems that supply the board with data on concentration levels and market conditions.\n•\nStress testing and sensitivity analysis are essential for assessing the impact of economic changes on asset quality, earnings, and capital, \npromoting continuous improvement in risk management and capital planning.\n•\nEffective risk management includes having a strong credit and risk rating system, along with managing interest reserves and loan \naccommodations, to accurately.\n4\nMaintain updated financial and \nanalytical information\n•\nInstitutions should keep up-to-date borrower financial statements, including property cash flow statements, rent rolls, guarantor personal \nstatements, tax returns, and other income property performance data.\n•\nConsideration of appraisals and evaluations from various economic conditions is crucial as the economic landscape shifts.\n•\nThis detailed information is essential for conducting meaningful stress testing and scenario analysis.\n5\nBolster the loan workout \ninfrastructure\n•\nEnsuring staff have the right skills to handle problem loans is key to resolving legal, appraisal, brokerage, and property management issues.\n6\nMaintain adequate liquidity and \ndiverse funding sources\n•\nImplement processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control liquidity and funding risks.\n•\nMaintain diverse and stable funding sources, which are especially crucial during economic challenges.\n•\nMaintain adequate levels of cash or cash equivalents.\n•\nIdentify and test sources of contingent liquidity, including access to the Federal Reserve discount window.\n•\nProper liquidity management enhances an institution's ability to support CRE profitability.\nLARGE BANKS POSE THE \nGREATEST RISK AND ARE TESTED \nANNUALLY USING THE CAMELS \nSYSTEM, WHILE MIDSIZE BANKS \nWITH $100-250 BILLION MAY BE \nEXAMINED EVERY OTHER YEAR. \nFederal Reserve \nCRE oversight\nIn fall 2023, the Federal Reserve released its \nSupervision and Regulation report, explaining  \nits developments in 2023 and priorities for \n2024. The Federal Reserve Board is focused on \nmonitoring CRE credit fluctuations, loan risk \nratings, and risk management reporting \nprotocols.\nSupervisors may opt to further examine banks \nthat appear riskier; for instance, an additional \ncredit quality and risk management test may \nbe required at a bank with a rapidly growing \nCRE concentration. \nREVIEWS ARE CENTERED ON \nEVALUATING CREDIT RISK \nMONITORING AND MEASUREMENT, \nINTERNAL LOAN RISK RATING \nACCURACY, RISK MITIGATION \nEFFORTS ON CRE LOANS, AND CRE \nRISK REPORTING TO THEIR FIRM'S \nBOARD AND SENIOR \nMANAGEMENT.\n16\nRegulatory \nframework for \nsmaller banks\nSmaller banks with under $100 billion in total \nconsolidated assets are inspected using the CAMELS \nsystem and RFI rating. Smaller banks including \ncommunity banking organizations (CBOs) have less \nthan $10 billion in total assets, and regional banking \norganizations (RBOs) have total assets between $10 \nbillion and $100 billion.\nCBOS AND RBOS\n17\nEVALUATING CBOS’ AND RBOS’ RESILIENCE\nFederal oversight of CRE  loan management\nCBOs and RBOs hold a high percentage of the banking sector’s CRE loans, so these players \nface increased scrutiny from the Fed. Based on June 2023 findings, many CBOs and RBOs were \ndescribed as “satisfactory”. Examiners closely monitor the management of liquidity risk and \ncontingency funding plans as well as a bank’s ability to respond to unexpected deposit \noutflows. \nThe FRB encourages these banks to maintain reliable, actionable, and diversified funding \nsources in addition to sufficient collateral to access funds quickly. Expect the Fed to continue \ndemanding robust risk management reports that quantify a changing economy’s impact.\n18\nCCAR and the Federal Reserve\nSimulating economic downturns\nThe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, implemented following \nthe 2008 financial crisis, is now a key regulatory tool. It assesses banks’ \nresilience to severe economic downturns, aiming to mitigate potential \nsystemic risks in future crises. Over time, CCAR has undergone \nsubstantial development, incorporating additional scenario elements and \nelevating regulatory standards for capital planning and stress testing \nprocedures at major financial institutions. \nThe CCAR annually evaluates banks on credit, market, and liquidity risks \nthrough hypothetical scenarios. These results are published by law, \nallowing public scrutiny of bank performance under stress tests. Banks \nare required to submit their capital plans and undergo stress testing \nunder hypothetical scenarios, including severe economic downturns, but \nmany institutions find it challenging to keep pace with evolving \nsupervisory expectations. \nUsing advanced computational tools and models not only facilitates \ncompliance with regulatory requirements but also supports strategic \ncapital planning and risk mitigation efforts.\nUtilize technology to simulate CCAR scenarios, forecasting your portfolio's performance under \ndiverse stress conditions. This approach helps in gaining an in-depth understanding of \nvulnerabilities, enhancing risk management practices, and making well-informed decisions. \nSuch strategic measures are crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance and bolstering financial \nresilience.\nClick here\nLearn more about CCAR scenarios in Commercial Mortgage Metrics.\nKey OCC updates to CRE lending\nMODERNIZING RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\nThe OCC posted a revised version of the Commercial Real Estate Lending booklet in March 2022, which provides guidance for prudent risk management and \nbest practices for compliance. The updated booklet applies to community and national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies \nof foreign banking associations. Examiners use the booklet to evaluate each bank depending on its individual circumstances. The new version of the booklet \nincludes OCC issuances that have been published and rescinded since the 2017 edition and incorporates modernized risk management and supervisory \nguidance.\nThere are specific guidelines laid out for banks when examining CRE portfolios, particularly regarding credit risk reviews and internal auditing. The booklet \nhighlights the importance of banks issuing periodic, independent credit risk reviews to verify risk rating accuracy and operational effectiveness to assess the \nportfolio’s overall quality. Internal audits offer critical information regarding the effectiveness of internal controls typically including underwriting, \ndisbursement, credit administration, workout activities, and ALLL or ACL processes, among others.\n19\nEvolving practices for CRE \nloan workouts\n20\nNCUA\nFDIC\nOCC\nFRB\nREGULATION \nFRAMEWORKS\nOn June 29, 2023, regulators issued a joint statement on commercial \nreal estate loan accommodations and workouts. This statement was \nfirst issued in 2009 following the global financial crisis and incorporates \nminor accounting-related updates.\nThe statement offers a framework for approaching commercial real \nestate loans in a manner that can relieve borrowers and lenders if \napplied judiciously. The policy provides guidelines detailing how to \nmodify and extend loans without facing losses. \nThe 2023 updates include a recommendation that banks accommodate \nborrowers who face financial challenges and demonstrate an honest \nwillingness to repay debts. Institutions that properly implement prudent \nCRE accommodations are absolved from criticism by regulators.\n21\nConsequences of noncompliance \n22\nImplications of noncompliance\n“Banks that are \napproaching \nregulatory thresholds \nfor CRE parameters \nrisk damaging \nconsequences and \npunitive measures to \ntheir institutions.”\n- Blake Coules, Senior Director \nIndustry Practice Lead \nRegulatory compliance is crucial in banking to ensure financial stability, consumer protection, and \nsystem integrity. However, some banks occasionally fail to meet these standards.\nIf financial shortcomings or risk issues are found, regulators may issue “matters requiring attention” \n(MRA) findings or “matters requiring immediate attention”(MRIA) findings to prompt swift and effective \nresolution of these concerns.\nNoncompliance poses two main threats: a downgrade in CAMELS rating, affecting a bank's operational \nfreedom, reputation, and increasing oversight; and the supervisor’s potential enforcement actions. \nSupervisory ratings are issued yearly for larger firms and every 18 months for smaller ones.\n22\n23\nRegulatory outlook\n24\nAssessing banks’ financial stability and resilience\nTo assess banks’ financial stability and resilience under extreme economic conditions, the Federal Reserve conducts \nannual stress tests, an essential tool for regulatory oversight. There were 31 banks included in the 2024 Federal Reserve \nstress test results report that passed the “severely adverse” test requirements for commercial real estate.\nStress testing\nThese tests are designed to evaluate how a bank would fare \nif the economy took a sudden nosedive, ensuring they have \nadequate capital reserves to withstand such shock. \nThe hypothetical recession referred to as a “Severely Adverse \nScenario” was used in 2024. The scenario assumes a 40% \ndecrease in value of CRE, a 10% unemployment rate, and a \nprojected CRE loan loss rate that mirrors 2023’s at 8.8%. \nThe results of this test determine whether a bank falls above \nthe Common Equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirements. \nTable 2.

Below is an illustration of the anticipated national average CRE Value Index for varied property categories, \naccording to the two 2024 CCAR scenarios, Baseline Scenario, and Severely Adverse Scenario. This alignment aids in compliance with regulatory expectations \nand in maintaining sufficient capital to cover losses during economic downturns.\nSource: Moody’s ‘Estimating Commercial Real Estate Stressed Loss Measures Under Federal Reserve 2024 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) Scenarios\n26\nGap between supply and demand for CRE debt tightening\nThe FDIC senior loan officer opinion survey tracks changes in banks' lending practices and risk attitudes. Survey data showing underwriting standards and \nloan demand converging indicates banks might start relaxing their lending criteria due to rising demand, hinting at a potential upturn in the lending market. \nThis scenario draws regulatory scrutiny to prevent excessive risk-taking that could threaten financial stability, like past crises. As the market recovers, banks \nare challenged to increase lending by adjusting underwriting standards, while ensuring they remain compliant with financial stability regulations.\nSources: FDIC, Moody’s CRE\nBanks under spotlight\nSee slide 5 for instructions on how to update footer\n27\nSource: Moody’s CRE \nFollowing significant bank failures, regulatory bodies are intensifying \ntheir scrutiny on the financial sector’s potential systemic risks. \nThey are now calling for more detailed disclosures from banks due to \ntougher borrowing environment characterized by stricter lending \nstandards and less available credit. \nBanks with substantial investments in CRE loans are at a heightened \nrisk of financial instability or failure. This risk is driven by the potential \nfor increased loan defaults and losses, as borrowers may struggle to \nmeet their obligations under more stringent conditions. \nFurthermore, the combination of rising interest rates and higher \nproperty vacancies could exacerbate losses for these banks. Regulators \nare increasingly worried that challenges within the CRE lending market \nmight precipitate wider financial distress among banks with significant \nCRE exposures.\nINCREASING INFORMATION REQUESTS \nYear\nNet \nAbsorption\nAsking Rent\nPercent \nChange\nEffective \nRent\nPercent \nChange\nVacancy \nRate\n2014\n28.9\n$30.24\n3.1%\n$24.45\n3.2%\n16.9%\n2015\n38.0\n$31.28\n3.4%\n$25.32\n3.6%\n16.5%\n2016\n29.3\n$32.00\n2.3%\n$25.95\n2.5%\n16.2%\n2017\n23.3\n$32.57\n1.8%\n$26.42\n1.8%\n16.4%\n2018\n23.0\n$33.45\n2.7%\n$27.14\n2.7%\n16.7%\n2019\n38.7\n$34.33\n2.6%\n$27.88\n2.7%\n16.8%\n2020\n-6.6\n$34.50\n0.5%\n$27.73\n-0.5%\n17.8%\n2021\n18.5\n$34.49\n0.0%\n$27.55\n-0.6%\n18.1%\n2022\n7.4\n$35.15\n1.9%\n$28.05\n1.8%\n18.8%\n2023\n-16.4\n$35.54\n1.1%\n$28.19\n0.5%\n19.6%\n2024\n2.0\n$35.94\n1.1%\n$28.32\n0.5%\n20.2%\n2025\n32.3\n$36.43\n1.4%\n$28.72\n1.4%\n20.2%\n2026\n33.6\n$37.01\n1.6%\n$29.26\n1.9%\n20.0%\n2027\n46.3\n$37.67\n1.8%\n$29.87\n2.1%\n19.4%\n2028\n42.5\n$38.40\n1.9%\n$30.59\n2.4%\n18.9%\nOffice Performance \n28\nAddressing compliance with \nMoody’s CRE solutions\n29\nSucceeding with \nMoody’s CRE solutions \nHarness the power of Moody’s CRE solutions to aid in  regulatory \ncompliance standards through detailed insights and analytics.\n29\nLeverage predictive analytics to provide accurate risk ratings, including \nassessments of loss given default and expected loss, providing a more \nnuanced and forward-looking approach to risk management.\nPerform thorough stress testing through simulating diverse economic \nscenarios, assisting banks in pinpointing potential portfolio \nvulnerabilities to help them prepare for adverse conditions.\nGenerate comprehensive reports for executive boards and regulators to \nmaintain strategic alignment, providing essential documentation and \ninsights that aid in showcasing regulatory compliance.\nPro Tip:\nUsing Moody's CRE data and solutions empowers lenders \nto navigate periods of heightened regulatory scrutiny with \nconfidence by providing comprehensive and reliable data \nanalytics.

More \nimportantly, it provides an important opportunity for you to demonstrate the actions you have taken to \nmitigate those deficiencies and risks. This instills confidence in your lead examiner and helps your \ninstitution appear proactive in addressing identified deficiencies.\n2\nManage expectations and stay up to date on new regulations \nBe aware of new regulations or regulatory changes in the past 18 months and be prepared to present a \nconcrete plan about how you are moving toward compliance with those regulations. Regulators don't \nexpect full, immediate compliance but ultimately want proof that you are proactively managing risks by \nmoving toward compliance.\n3\nProvide granular loan-level analysis in an era of intensified CRE scrutiny \nIncreasing CRE scrutiny means it is no longer enough to present regulators with a portfolio-level \nanalysis of risks. Make sure you can produce reports and stress tests that forecast various time \nintervals and stress critical loan factors such as cap rate, interest rate, and debt service coverage at \nthe loan level \n4\nDemonstrate in-depth awareness with a 360- degree view of CRE market \nCRE is a market-specific industry. Being able to speak to a loan's specific market and asset class \nconditions - primarily the new supply entering that market and the rate at which it is being absorbed - \nis a solid demonstrator that you are aware of a loan's environment and the factors that may affect its \nrisk profile. Additionally, it provides greater insight into risks that may not be factored into stress tests \nand risk-forecasting analyses, further demonstrating to regulators that you possess a truly 360-degree \nview of a loan’s risks.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n35\nSources\n1.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202311-supervision-and-regulation-report.pdf pg. 5\n2.\nhttps://cre.moodysanalytics.com/insights/cre-news/nycb-announcement-foreshadows-trouble-to-come-in-2024-but-downside-has-clear-limits/ pg. 7\n3.\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2023/fil23064.html pg. 13\n4.\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/fil23064a.pdf pg. 13\n5.\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-364 pg. 14\n6.\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-365/subpart-A pg. 14\n7.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202311-supervision-and-regulation-report.pdf pg. 15\n8.\nhttps://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/commercial-real-estate-lending/pub-ch-commercial-real-estate.pdf pg. 19\n9.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230629a1.pdf pg. 20\n10. https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2024-dfast-results-20240626.pdf pg. 24\n11.
