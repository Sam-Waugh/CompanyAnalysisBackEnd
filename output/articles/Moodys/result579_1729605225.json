Despite the customer-facing nature of this transformation, credit and accounting\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com\nexecutives are well positioned to lead banks’ strategic transformation. Following successful\nJapan\nCECL implementations, these executives possess working relationships with multidisciplinary\n+81 3 5408 4100\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com experts across the back-office, detailed knowledge of credit data and use cases, and deep\nexperience developing controlled processes for delivering actionable insight.\nThe role of the reserve manager\nReserve managers have always had the unenviable task of estimating and defending the most\nabstract question in banking. CECL motivated bank investment in foundational credit loss\nmeasurement tools that enable process enhancements across the credit lifecycle. The\ncomplexity of the new estimate and scale of reserve change distracted stakeholders from the\npotential process transformation CECL’s insights enable. Reengaging these stakeholders with\nan actionable credit narrative is a competitive imperative.\nTo lead this transformation, reserve managers must provide stakeholders with the means to\ninterpret the new estimate and connect its granular, forward-looking insights to changes in\nmanagement processes. Financial planning & analysis (FP&A), capital planning, underwriting\nand credit administration, customer strategies, and investor relations can all gain from\ninsights provided by reserve managers. Thoughtful consideration of estimate inputs, quarterly\nreserve changes and comparison to peer results are key ingredients for engaging stakeholders\nin CECL’s nuances the transformational potential deeper credit insights enable.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CECL BEN CHMARKING FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 1Why are benchmarks important?\nBenchmarking is a key tool available to reserve managers to disseminate insight and drive action throughout the organization.\nBenchmarks can go beyond defense of the reserve estimate--providing actionable insights to help management:\n» Set clear business goals\n» Understand what is happening in the portfolio and market\n» Focus on the right customer opportunities\n» Direct expertise where it adds value\nEach of these objectives go beyond defense of the reserve estimate. Knowledge is powerful—transformational potential expands\nwhen what you know changes what you do. To create an action plan that best suits your organization, the following questions are\nuseful to consider:\n» How do reserve outputs impact your company's key business activities?\n» How can CECL tools be adapted, or their insights applied, as an empirical anchor for expert judgement beyond reserves?\n» What external references would enhance management's understanding of the portfolio and credit insights CECL can provide?\nWhat’s driving today’s reserve number?\nCECL’s forward-looking, granular view of credit is well aligned with several processes across the credit lifecycle—a meaningful\nbreak from reserves under incurred loss. This alignment derives both from accounting standards’ effort to prevent delay of credit\nloss recognition and consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information than that used in incurred loss\nmethodologies. To demystify CECL models for reserve stakeholders, it can be useful to present the alignment of model drivers\nwithin a broader credit and business context. A framework for this is presented in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 CECL quantitative reserve drivers\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CECL BENCHMARKING FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 2Individual model characteristics may vary – for example, unit of account and length of reasonable and supportable period – but all\nchanges in the quantitative portion of any CECL estimate can be attributed to the three categories shown above: forward-looking\ndata, product mix, and portfolio credit quality. The more granular, volatile nature of CECL results challenge many reserve\nstakeholders to revisit the way they absorb and forecast reserve outputs. For example, FP&A budgeting for reserve levels on new\nloan volume, or future quarters’ reserve impacts on profitability. Reporting CECL results and structuring these updated connections\naround the factors in Figure 1 is a key first step for creating an actionable transformation narrative. With a deeper understanding of\nhow their process relates to reserve results, stakeholders can begin to prioritize investments to enhance profitability and\nperformance.\nThese categories also align with portfolio activities owned by key reserve stakeholders. The CECL estimate drivers match criteria\nevaluated to extend credit – reserves are the result of how a portfolio is managed. If portfolio administrators can corroborate\nreserve estimates using evidence from their work, reserve managers are no longer left to defend loss estimates independently.\nBeyond portfolio administration, CECL’s multi-scenario view of the portfolio central default tendency can be used to plan changes\nto underwriting, portfolio, asset liability management (ALM) or merger and acquisition (M&A) strategies.\nWhat changed since yesterday’s reserve estimate?\nThe next step for stakeholders is to understand which variables are affecting changes in reserves period to period and the\nreasonableness of reserve movements. This understanding will depend on their portfolio understanding and beliefs about the\nstatus of the economic and credit cycles. These concerns are always relevant, but CECL’s response to stress most clearly\nexemplifies the need for this capability, as economic stress corresponds with the greatest period-to-period reserve change.\nTargeting loss mitigation activities, scaling originations or risk appetite, and business planning activities could all benefit from CECL\ninsight. CECL models are not a crystal ball. However, anchoring judgements that contribute to the forecast, mix or credit quality to\nquarterly changes in reserve estimates can help to interpret the portfolio’s progression although a stressed cycle.\nThe initial adoption of CECL at the start of 2020 coincided with the outbreak of Covid-19 and a subsequent recession. This\nprovided useful examples of reserve behavior and the ways detailed analysis can anchor management’s expert judgement.\nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) estimates1 provide February 2020 and April 2020 as the bounds of the recession.\nDespite this, significant uncertainty about the extent of economic damage caused by the pandemic lingered far beyond the\nrecession’s end – the NBER waited until July 2021 to announce the recession’s end date. Recalling this environment and mindset is\nessential to understanding how reserve attribution can provide an important benchmark for expert judgement in stressed\nconditions.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, macroeconomic forecasts declined significantly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reserves\nresponded quickly to this decline, which deteriorated further in the second quarter, when seasonally adjusted, US unemployment\npeaked at 14.7%.2 The recession was unusual in that lockdowns were its proximate cause, but coincident actions by Congress, the\nFederal Reserve, state and local governments prevented the credit migration and loss emergence that was anticipated by CECL\nmodels’ response to the forecast deterioration. Ordinarily, migration and loss emergence would be key benchmarks for\nmanagement navigating a credit portfolio through a recession and its aftermath (assuming the government interventions that\naccompanied the pandemic do not recur in future recessions). The combination of a recovery in the economic forecast, credit\nmigration and charge-off would help management see that issues were working their way through the portfolio, but better days\nlay ahead. In turn, this would influence action by reserve managers, portfolio managers and loan origination appetite. An example\nof this breakdown of reserves is provided in Figure 2.\n1 National Bureau of Economic Research. (2021, July 19). Business Cycle Dating Committee Announcement.

Understanding how reserves compare with market or\npeer reserve trends can also provide meaningful support for management’s judgements.\nQ1 2020 disclosures were the first chance for most issuers to see their peers’ reserve levels under CECL. As the pandemic unfolded\nthroughout the year, there was great interest in reserve levels and the allocation of reserves to individual asset classes. These were\nused to support judgements about the likely level of loss and where it would originate. As Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate, direct\ncomparison to peers’ reserve levels and changes in reserves provide a first order indicator of differences in expectation across\ninstitutions – but this is only a starting point.\nFigure 3 Reserve level by segment benchmark\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CECL BENCHMARKING FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 4Figure 4 Quarterly reserve change by segment benchmark\nPublicly available call report or SEC filing data allow reserve stakeholders to aggregate benchmarks like these, but do not provide\ndeeper insight into reserve drivers. Without this, it is difficult to attribute differences in reserve levels.\nSegment and credit quality disclosures provide some insight into mix and credit migration. However, there are still meaningful\nquestions about differences in expected lives, forecast assumptions or expected default and recoveries represented in peer\nreserves. These all limit the explanatory value of reserve level comparison. Within each segment shown in the charts above, the\nrange of estimates could reflect differences in many areas, including economic forecasts used, variances in expected lives, and\ndifferences in credit quality. In addition, public data often does not segregate the quantitative and qualitative components of\nreserve estimates. Your model results may match those of peers, but if they’re applying different qualitative adjustments, there’s\nno way to know.\nIs there value in benchmarking beyond final reserve balances?\nWhile economic scenarios captured significant attention ahead of CECL adoption, prepayment assumptions can significantly affect\nthe expected life reflected in reserve results. This impact can be understood through weighted average life (WAL) and weighted\naverage maturity (WAM) benchmarks, illustrated in Figure 5.\nWAM represents the average time to receipt of all future principal cashflows for instruments in a portfolio, including prepayment\nand default. Higher values indicate a longer expected life. Since prepayments and default make expected lives shorter than\ncontractual term, it can also be helpful to understand loan age differences. This is calculated using a balance-weighted average of\nyears to contractual maturity for all instruments in a portfolio and is expressed by WAM. Higher values indicate a longer\ncontractual life.\nFigure 5 Weighted average life vs. maturity benchmarks\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CECL BENCHMARKING FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 5Benchmarks can provide additional consideration for differences in expected lives and credit quality. For example, low values for\nprobability of default (PD) and WAL combine with high WAM to indicate a high degree of prepayment reflected in peer\nbenchmark rates. Looking at these benchmarks over several quarters, as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, can provide further insight\nto support management judgements about the progression of a stress event through peer portfolios. For instance, are peers\nanticipating a near-term turnaround, or still building reserves in anticipation of further deterioration? Separating default (PD) and\nrecovery (loss given default or LGD) risks in peer data enables separation of bad borrowers from good collateral, or good borrowers\nfrom declining property values.\nFigure 6 Portfolio PD five-quarter trend\nFigure 7 Portfolio LGD five-quarter trend\nReserve managers lead the way\nIn the Anticipation Economy, successful banks will invest to differentiate their customer experience and generate profitable\ngrowth. Savvy banks will leverage interdisciplinary insights from their back office, including risk, compliance, IT, finance, and capital\nplanning, to reimagine and integrate activities across the customer lifecycle.\nWith their insight into data inputs, multidisciplinary use of forecasts and alignment with credit decisioning across the customer\nlifecycle, CECL reserve managers are uniquely positioned to lead this transformation.\nBenchmarks are one of reserve managers’ most important tools to encourage reserve stakeholder engagement. Benchmarks can\nhelp to tell a story that drives cross-business engagement by spurring stakeholder interpretation and buy-in – and so inspiring\ntransformation. They are key to anchoring management judgement through the credit cycle and keeping your organization\ncompetitive in a changing landscape.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CECL BENCHMARKING FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 6© 2022 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
