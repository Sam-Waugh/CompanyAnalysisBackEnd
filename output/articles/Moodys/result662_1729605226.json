Stein1,2\nMoody’s Research Labs, New York\nWorking Paper #2011-05-01\nFirst draft: February 3, 2010\nCurrent draft: June 15, 2011\nAbstract\nThe recent financial crisis has caused risk managers to reevaluate the techniques they use\nfor assessing the risk of extreme losses to their portfolios. Some have argued that the use\nof distribution-based measures such as VaR and expected shortfall (ES) should be deem-\nphasized in favor of stress-testing and scenario analysis. In this short note we discuss the\nbenefits of stress-testing and scenario analysis. We also describe some limitations of sce-\nnario-based approaches as a sole mechanism for assessing portfolio risk. We provide a\nnumber of examples to illustrate these limitations. In particular, except in special cases, it\nis difficult to use stress scenarios alone, ex ante, for allocating capital across disparate\nportfolios. However, stress-testing and scenario analysis can complement measures such\nas VaR and ES and thereby better inform both risk assessment and business strategy de-\nvelopment. We believe stress testing is integral to prudent credit risk management. Our\nview is that neither stress testing nor VaR type measures, in and of themselves, provide a\ncomplete description of credit portfolio risk. However, combining both approaches re-\nsults in more robust risk analysis and permits risk managers to combine robust quantita-\ntive measures with managerial intuition and judgment to arrive at more comprehensive\nassessments of both portfolio risk and overall firm strategy.\n1 Introduction\nA BIS study (Committee on the Global Financial System, 2005) compiled survey results\non the stress-testing practices of 64 banks and securities firms across 16 countries. At that\ntime, the authors found that:\nThe exercise illustrated the wide range of stress test practices at banks and securities firms. The\nuse of stress tests continues to broaden from the exploration of exceptional, but plausible events -\n1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent the views of current or former employers (Moody’s\nResearch Labs, Moody’s Investors Service, Moody’s Risk Management Services, Moody’s KMV) or any of their affiliates.

Stein 1DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nthe traditional focus of stress testing - to cover a much wider range of applications... The expanded\nusage of stress testing derives from its wider acceptance within firms. Aside from its inherent\nflexibility, it benefits from explicitly linking potential impacts to specific events.\nAlthough the use of stress testing by banks appears to have been growing prior to the cri-\nsis, the focus at that time appears to have been primarily on applications to market risk.\nFor example, the BIS study found that stress testing related to market risk represented\nabout 80% of all tests reported. In contrast, stress testing for non-traded portfolios (e.g.,\nloan books, retail and other credit portfolios) was nascent in most institutions, as were\npractical methods for integrating the risks of different portfolios across an institution.\nSince the crisis, however, there has been considerably more attention given to these is-\nsues. This is evidenced by the sudden and pronounced growth in the literature on stress\ntesting (starting in about 2006) and the frequent focus of regulators and risk managers on\nthe design and implementation of stress tests since the crisis.\nStress tests are being used in a broader variety of contexts than even in the recent past\nand being applied to a wider set of tasks. These applications range from the more tradi-\ntional regulatory reporting and risk management, to newer uses as part of the due dili-\ngence process for acquisition analysis and in strategic planning to set a bank’s risk appe-\ntite or determine which business segments to grow or stem. Within the regulatory com-\nmunity, stress testing has also emerged as a key tool in monitoring systemic risk.\nIn this paper, we focus primarily on how stress testing can be used to enhance credit port-\nfolio risk management and the analysis of systemic credit risk. We present perspectives\non both the great strengths and the important limitations of stress testing and scenario\nanalysis for these applications. Although our focus is on credit risk, a number of our ob-\nservations also carry over to stress testing exercises related to market risk and liquidity\nrisk, though we do not consider these in detail here.\nThe recent resurgence of interest in stress testing has occurred, in part, because there is\narguably no more intuitive form of risk analysis than a stress test. The selection of factors\nto be considered in scenarios for, and the analysis of output resulting from stress-testing\nexercises often precipitates intense and productive discussions between business manag-\ners and risk managers within a financial institution.\nFor example, in setting a firm’s risk appetite, stress testing provides an means for a bank\nto go beyond generic statements such as: “The bank will not take on any risks that put the\nenterprise at risk.” to more concrete ones such as: “The bank should be able to withstand\na mild recession while still achieving break-even profitability and maintaining a 4% Tier\nI capital reserve,” and to provide analysis to support this.\nStress tests also offer alternative perspectives and additional flexibility. It can be difficult\nto use more quantitative techniques to examine the extreme tails of distributions that fall\noutside of the dynamics (or the data) of historical experience (cf., (Bohn & Stein, 2009)).\nStress-testing exercises provide a means to associate concrete views on states of the\nworld with model outputs and to evaluate those outputs for reasonableness.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 2DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nSome market participants have gone so far as to advocate for the use of stress testing as a\nsubstitute for more traditional loss-distribution type measures (e.g., multifactor VaR3 or\nExpected Shortfall (ES)). Our view is more measured. While we find stress testing to be\nvaluable for gaining insight into an institution’s portfolios and models, we see it as a\ncomplement to rather than a replacement for distribution-based methods.\nIn this paper we discuss our views on the practical role of stress testing within the credit\nrisk-management function. We differentiate the use of stress testing as a qualitative ap-\nproach to understanding and providing a reality check for a model or portfolio on the one\nhand, from the use of stress testing in a quantitative setting as a capital measure, on the\nother. In most cases, it appears to be difficult to use stress testing as the sole mechanism\nfor making quantitative statements, ex ante, about the probabilities of large future losses\non a bank’s various holdings; it is also difficult to find a single or small set of general\nstress scenarios that will be adequate to measure risk consistently across portfolios.4 This\nimplies that setting capital based solely on stress tests results can be challenging.\nThis conclusion is based on three observations:\n1. It can be hard, in general, to order macro-economic stress scenarios (from worst\nto best), even when point probabilities can be assigned to them, except through ex\npost reference to the portfolio-specific losses that are forecast under the scenarios.\n2. The cumulative loss probability under a stress scenario will vary from portfolio to\nportfolio (or for a single portfolio over time), making designing generic stress\nthresholds hard ex ante.\n3. It is difficult to assert that the behavior of market participants during moments of\nextreme stress will be similar to (or an extrapolation of) the behavior of partici-\npants during normal or even “very bad” times. Ultimately, therefore, the linkage\nbetween an extreme state of the economy and the behavior of assets in that ex-\ntreme state is a matter of judgment, not empirical fact. While this is not a limita-\ntion that is unique to scenario analysis, it can be particularly pronounced, given\nthe extreme nature of many stress scenarios.\nDespite its limitations as a stand-alone capital allocation approach, stress testing is none-\ntheless a valuable component of a robust credit-risk management program as it can help\nmitigate model risk and provide insight into macro-economic cases outside of a model’s\nconstruct. Said more strongly, not performing stress-testing exercises may lead to signifi-\ncant oversights in credit risk management.\n3 Note that when we refer to VaR, we are not referring to single-factor copula type models or percentiles on historical data, but rather\nto more sophisticated models that capture more fully the structure of individual assets and heterogeneous portfolios.\n4 Interestingly, (Alfaro & Drehmann, 2009) report on a study of stress tests done prior to the Crisis of 2007-9 and conclude that most\nstress tests were not adequate, since the majority did not raise any red flags with respect to banking system fragility.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 3DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nIn addition to informing the risk management processes, however, stress testing can also\nbe inform discussions of business strategy. As risk-management functions at financial\ninstitutions have evolved, considerations of downside risk have become a larger compo-\nnent of the strategic discussions regarding an institution’s risk appetite. Evaluation of the\nimpact of stress scenarios on a business is one effective method for gaining insight into\nwhich strategies may lead the institution to operate outside the bounds of its overall risk\nappetite (as specified by its board-level risk committee). For example, the results of a\nbank-wide stress-testing exercise may suggest certain business lines for which lending or\nexposure limits should be reduced or increased, or the results may inform the allocation\nof risk management staff and resources in the bank. Furthermore, trends in stress-testing\nresults can serve as early warning signals for senior managers.\nBecause stress scenarios are easier for business managers to grasp, they can be applied\nmore readily to strategic decisions. Capital sufficiency discussions can then merge with\nrisk-strategy discussions and thus bring the objectives of business managers risk manag-\ners closer in line. Stress-testing exercises make risk models more tangible, thereby mak-\ning it easier for business managers and risk managers to communicate about the likeli-\nhood and severity of extreme losses.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we will outline some arguments that motivate these obser-\nvations. We begin by describing a simple taxonomy of stress scenarios in Section 2. Sec-\ntion 3 describes some of the challenges in using stress test results probabilistically across\nportfolios. Section 4 discusses applications of stress testing in both internal risk manage-\nment and regulatory settings. Finally, Section 5 concludes by summarizing some key ob-\nservations.\n2 Types of stress scenarios\nThe term “stress scenario” is frequently used without definition. This may be due, in part,\nto the evolution of stress testing, which started in many institutions primarily as a tool for\nexamining the market risk of portfolios (Committee on the Global Financial System,\n2005). In a market-risk context, the definition of a stress test is generally self-evident\nsince the factors in a stress scenario typically involve variables like interest-rate levels\nand term structure, the levels of equity indices, and so forth. The primary concern in a\nmarket-risk is the level and volatility of the factors themselves, since these directly de-\ntermine the price of the asset. Therefore, stressing a portfolio is exactly equivalent to\nstressing underlying market factors. Interest-rate swaps derive their market value directly\nfrom the underlying rate structure and equity positions often track closely the value of\nbroad market indices, so shocking interest rates or equity indices forms a straightforward\nstress test.\nHowever, recently, interest has expanded beyond market risk. As a result, more general\nmacro-economic factors (such as GDP, oil prices or home prices) or asset-class-specific\nloss rates (such as default rates for mortgages or small and medium enterprises (SMEs))\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 4DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nhave become components of stress tests. In these cases, it is not always easy to find a di-\nrect link between the factor level and the asset value that depends on it. Instead, some sort\nof more complex linking function is required to translate a change in the factor level to a\nchange in the asset value.\nFor purposes of this paper, we define two broad types of stress scenarios: those that we\nterm structural stress scenarios and those that we term reduced-form stress scenarios. We\nadopt this terminology from the credit-modeling literature in which a structural model\nrefers to one in which there is a causal, economically intuitive relationship between the\nlevel of a firm’s asset value and its probability of default. In contrast, reduced-form mod-\nels treat default events as “surprises,” the causes of which are not part of the model, but\nthe behavior of which can be observed.\nThough the analogy is imperfect, in our taxonomy, a structural stress scenario is one that\nposits a particular state of the economy, as described by macro-economic state variables\n(e.g., the level of unemployment), and relies on some form of model to link this state of\nthe world, in an economically plausible manner, to the resulting state of the assets. Re-\nduced-form scenarios, on the other hand, directly posit the state of the assets (e.g., the\nlevel of default rates), without necessarily providing an economic cause for this state. In\nthe remainder of this section, we discuss the form and properties of these different ap-\nproaches as well as the constraints that each places on a stress-testing exercises.\nWe begin with the more economically motivated scenarios. These involve examining the\neffects on a portfolio or firm of some particular macro-economic path, which we term\nstructural scenarios. These scenarios can be particularly helpful for communicating risks\nbecause a firm’s management and risk managers can use the tangible nature of the macro-\neconomic factors to evaluate the plausibility of the scenario and to imagine how individ-\nual factors might evolve, given the states of the others. In order to use such scenarios, the\nstress-testing exercise must also make use of one or more linking functions that serve to\nrelate the value of these macro-economic factors to asset behavior. For example, stress-\ntesting an SME portfolio using, say, changes in GDP, would require a function that trans-\nlated changes in GDP into changes in the individual or aggregate loan losses.\n(Virolainen, 2004) provides one example of this approach. The author uses a non-linear\naggregate model to determine the relationships between key macro-economic factors and\nthe aggregate corporate default rates in different sectors in Finland by estimating a SURE\nmodel and then using these estimates to stress the aggregate sector default rates.5 (Otani,\nShiratsuka, Tsurui, & Yamadaa, 2009) give another example of such a stress-testing ex-\nercise from a regulatory perspective. The authors describe their implementation of an ag-\ngregate model for borrower-rating transitions, driven by GDP and Debt. In their model,\naggregation occurs at the rating category level.\n5 The author implicitly assumes that the composition of firms (with respect to factor sensitivities) remains constant and also that be-\nhavior in the stressed economic environment is a direct extrapolation from the unstressed behavior (the author alludes to this in foot-\nnote 23 of the article).\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 5DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nAlthough intuitive, structural stress scenarios make high demands on stress testers since\nnot only must the movements of the economic factors be internally consistent, but the\nresulting asset behaviors, given those movements, must also be characterized through the\nlinking function. Far less demanding are reduced-form6 scenarios that do not require such\nlinks: a stress tester must define only the asset behaviors themselves. The economic\nmechanism that led to the behaviors is superfluous to the exercise.\nPrior to the crisis, use of such reduced-form scenarios was common. For example, at the\ntime of the BIS’s 2004 study, most banks credit-stress tested their loan books by simply\nshocking quantities such as PD and LGD levels or rating transition rates (Committee on\nthe Global Financial System, 2005). (Rösch & Scheule, 2007) offer a more recent exam-\nple of a reduced-form framework for stress testing retail portfolios at the aggregate level.\nIn their approach, PDs and correlations are stressed in various ways. The authors assume\na single-factor credit model for PD that they apply to each (homogeneous) asset class.7\nFinally, some factors, such as interest rates, may take either structural or reduced-form\nrole. In the case of interest rates, exposures such as interest-rate swaps or risk-free securi-\nties may be evaluated directly through their explicit dependence on the level of interest\nrates at a specific point on the yield curve. However, for other instruments, interest rates\nmight be a structural factor. For example, mortgages have more complex relationships to\ninterest rate levels since the speed of prepayments, the interest burden, and so forth de-\npend in part on interest-rate levels, in part on other macro-economic factors such as home\nprices and in part on non-macro factors such as the initial coupon of the mortgage or the\nloan structure. In this case, more complicated linking functions are required to determine\nthe impact of changes in interest-rate levels.\nWe can understand better how to use these approaches by examining their respective\ncharacteristics. Table 1 provides a brief comparison of the two approaches along some of\nthe key dimensions for stress testing.\n6 Note that (Lopez, 2005) terms these tests, scenario and sensitivity tests, respectively. Other authors use the term sensitivity to refer to\nany perturbing of key risk model parameters for purposes of better understanding the model.\n7 Note also that in some practical settings, regardless of how the stressed state of the assets is determined (through structural or re-\nduced-form scenarios) it may be necessary to further translate the stressed state of the assets an ultimate portfolio loss through the use\nof some portfolio tool. This translation might be the case for an institution using a software tool that takes as input the asset state (e.g.,\nPDs or CDR curves), and then translates these into losses through the application of functions to calculate cash flows or lost interest\nunder such scenarios.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R.

Depends on macro factors se-\nstress scenario erogeneity lected and the factor loadings\nThere is a natural interplay between the dimensions of Asset Relationships and Economic\nRationale, which might be considered the defining characteristics of each approach. In\ngeneral, the great benefit of the reduced-form approach is the relaxation of the require-\nment that there be a link between the fundamental macro-economic factors and the asset\nbehavior. (“Default rates increase by 30%…”) The structural approach imposes this rela-\ntionship. The payoff for this imposition comes in that there is typically a clear economic\nexplanation for why the assets behave the way they do (“…because unemployment rates\nrise to 10%.”). The direct causal relationship between a change in a macro-economic\nvariable and a specific risk parameter is a salient attribute of the structural approach.\nThe recourse back to fundamental relationships also provides a means for ensuring that\nthe behavior across assets or portfolios is consistent – at least with respect to assumptions\nabout states of the world. In a reduced-form stress scenario, if the default rate on asset\nclass A doubles, should the default rate for another asset class (B) also double, increase\nby only 1.5 times, or stay flat? The reduced-form approach provides little guidance.\nIn contrast, under a structural stress scenario, if the default rate on asset A increases by\n30% because unemployment rises to 10% on one portfolio, then we can examine what\nhappens to the default rate on asset B when unemployment rises to 10%. In this way the\ndefault-rate shocks will be more consistent across portfolios. The macro factors serve as\nan anchor to ensure that the same states of the world obtain in each portfolio - though the\nbehavior is still subject to the individual linking functions.\nThe issue of how robust a stress scenario is to differences in portfolio structure (last row\nin Table 1) is one that we deal with in more detail in Sections 3.2-3.2.2. It turns out that\nheterogeneity within and across portfolios implies that a specific macro-economic stress\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 7DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nscenario will be more or less stressful for some portfolios than others, even when the as-\nsets are of the same broad type. This is because different macro-economic behaviors may\naffect different individual assets differently. Reduced-form stress scenarios simply im-\npose a specific level of asset behavior without reference to the macro-economic scenario\nand thereby sidestep this issue.\n3 Using stress tests probabilistically\n(Berkowitz, 2000) proposes a formal definition of stress tests and goes on to argue that\nstress tests be combined with distributional analyses (e.g., VaR) in a coherent framework.\nThe proposed mechanism through which this is achieved is for each scenario (or for the\nstressed-scenario distribution as a whole) to be assigned a probability (either based on\nhistorical data or subjectively) and for the distribution underlying a VaR model be simi-\nlarly assigned a realization probability. These distributions (of the various scenarios and\nVaR distributions) are then sampled proportionately to their probabilities. Embedded in\nthe author’s recommendation are the assumptions that it is feasible to assign probabilities\n(and factor distributions) to the stress scenarios and that the objective of the stress testing\nis to examine a single portfolio, rather than to stress across multiple portfolios.\nTo some degree these assumptions may hold for single portfolios. However, it does not\nappear to be the case more generally. One of the emerging requirements for stress testing\nis that portfolios be comparable both within a single institution (e.g., the SME and mort-\ngage portfolios) and across multiple institutions (e.g., SME portfolios across large major\ninstitutions), and in this setting, it is not clear that the implicit assumptions of (Berkowitz,\n2000) are practically feasible, if the goal is to keep the cumulative probability of the\nlosses constant across portfolios (e.g., for capital allocation).\nAs we will discuss in this section, with the exception of some special cases, it is typically\nnot possible ex ante to derive, in a manner that permits generalization across portfolios,\nthe probability of losses exceeding the loss obtained under a specific scenario without\nreference to the full loss distribution of the portfolio.\nFor example, some mistakenly assert that the cumulative probability of a loss being\ngreater than a loss under a specific stress scenario is equivalent to the probability of the\nscenario. Thus, if a certain scenario has, say, a 1 in 50 probability of occurring, the asser-\ntion would be that that 98% of losses on a portfolio would be less severe than the losses\nunder the scenario (1-1/50 = 0.98). This is generally not true.8\nIn the remainder of this section, we will explore why this might be so.\n8 Mathematically, we might write that the probability of an event e being worst than a particular event E ,(cid:1868)(cid:3032), is not equivalent to the\ni (cid:3036)\nprobability of a loss l being worse than the loss.

Stein 8DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\n3.1 The mappings required to move from a scenario to a cumulative loss quantile\n(economic capital)\nConsider the steps needed to move from the definition of a particular stress scenario to\ndetermining the probability of a loss exceeding the loss under that scenario, as would be\nrequired for capital allocation purposes. (For simplicity, we only contemplate the steps of\nsuch a mapping for a single portfolio.):\n1. First, define a method for constructing coherent and realistic scenarios. By coherent\nand realistic, we mean that the scenarios reflect reasonable behaviors for interactions\nof the factors in the scenario. That is, the combination of scenario factors must be\nplausible. This should be true even if the scenario itself represents an extreme case.\nFor example, it would be unusual to find a state of the world in which unemployment\nin each major region in a country increased by 1% but the national level unemploy-\nment increased by 4%. To be clear, there may be specific reasons for designing such\nscenarios, but such instances are rare and their use should be deliberate rather than\nunintentional or ad hoc.\nIn practice, a number of approaches may be used for generating such stress scenarios.\nBy far the most common is the use of heuristics and judgment. Such approaches are\nconvenient. However, as the number of factors stressed becomes greater (e.g., more\nthan a few) it becomes increasingly difficult to enforce coherence.9 This is particu-\nlarly so in instances where forecasts are averaged from multiple sources to form a\nconsensus forecast. In preference to heuristic forecasts, some analysts sample from\nhistorical time periods by choosing historically stressful windows or by bootstrapping\nhistorical samples. The most sophisticated forecasts are produced by using some\nform of structural model of the economy, which may then be shocked in various ways\nto produce more internally consistent forecasts for multiple series simultaneously (cf.,\n(Zandi & Blinder, 2010)).\n2. Assign a probability to the scenario. Though not strictly required, it is often desired.\nThis may be done by means of expert judgment, the use of more formal Bayesian ap-\nproaches (cf, (Rebonato, 2010)), through historical sampling, or through the use of\neconomic simulations. Note that this scenario probability is only the probability that\nsuch a scenario will occur, not the probability that other “worse” or “better” scenarios\nwill take place10.\n9 For example, there are 50 states in the US. As it turns out, using the NAR index of median home prices, the change in State-level\nmedian home prices between 2005Q1 and 2010Q4 varied substantially from state to state, from a maximum decline of -57% (NV) to\na 4% net increase (OK). Interestingly, the paths of the changes were also quite different, with some States hitting their lowest values\nin 2006Q1 and others still in decline as of 2010Q4. Clearly, assuming the national level home price change of -26% with a low in\n2009Q2 would severely understate declines in some regions while overstating it in others. Depending on the exposures of a particular\nportfolio, this would make the losses more or less extreme.\n10 If the number of factors in a scenario is small and the number of factor-states is similarly constrained, it is feasible, under the as-\nsumption that the factors fully span the space of all portfolio behaviors, to map out a fuller distribution of economic factors in a Bayes-\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 9DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\n3. Map the scenario to an asset- or portfolio-specific loss. This is done through a link-\ning function of some sort. For example, an SME probability of default model might\ntake as input GDP and other factors and produce a point-in-time PD. Alternatively, a\nmortgage model might make use of the loan-to-value (LTV) of a mortgage in which\nthe “value” component is calculated as a function of the original LTV and change in\nthe home price index for the region under the stress scenario.\n4. Assign a cumulative probability to the exposure loss. Strictly speaking, the point\nprobability of the specific loss associated with a specific stress scenario should be the\nsame as that of the scenario as specified in (2). However, for capital allocation pur-\nposes we need more. We need the cumulative probability of the loss, which requires\nthat the losses be ordered. To estimate how much capital to allocate, we also typi-\ncally need a sufficiently large number of scenarios to be able determine the typical or\naverage loss of an exposure or sub-portfolio when the entire portfolio loss exceeds the\ncapital threshold. Analyses that use only a small number of scenarios may understate\nthe capital usage of a particular exposure or group of exposures. Also note that for\nreasons we will articulate in more detail below, these probabilities (or even the sce-\nnario orderings) cannot usually be transferred from one portfolio to the other or from\nthe same portfolio from one date to a later date after trading has occurred and instru-\nments have become more seasoned.\nThe difficulty in ordering scenarios ex ante makes it challenging to use stress testing as a\ngeneral technique for capital allocation across portfolios. This is the subject of Section\n3.2.\n3.2 Ordering individual stress scenarios\nIt is typically not possible to order macro-economic scenarios themselves ex ante. For\nexample:\n• Is a 2% rise in national unemployment worse than a 10% drop in national home\nprices?\n• Is a 10% drop in national home prices worse than a $20/barrel rise in the price of\noil?\nIn both cases, the resolution of which scenario is “worse” depends on a number of fac-\ntors, including an understanding of which types of assets are being stressed. Consider an\ninstitution that has an active business lending to energy producers and airlines. For this\nportfolio, a $20/barrel rise in oil prices might be a very bad thing as its borrowers will\nface economic constraints in their businesses. However, if the lending institution also\nholds a portfolio of RMBS tranches that are sensitive to home prices, the ranking of stress\nian context as in (Rebonato, 2010). However, even in this setting, the distribution will not necessarily order the scenarios with respect\nto the severity losses for a given portfolio.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 10DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\ncases becomes more complicated. Inevitably, the question of which scenario is “worse”\nraises the corresponding retort “For whom?”\nThis has only a little to do with whether economists can assign probabilities to different\nscenarios. Even if the probabilities are given exogenously and we can rely on them, de-\ntermining the ranking of two scenarios in terms of their generic severity is typically pos-\nsible for only the starkest cases (e.g., a 1% increase in GDP vs. a 1% decline in GDP)11.\nKnowing that a particular scenario has a 1 in 50 or a 1 in 25 probability of occurring does\nnot usually imply a ranking of its severity for a particular portfolio.\nSome authors explicitly recognize this. (Breuer, Jandačka, Rheinberger, & Summer,\n2008), for example, suggest a search approach for identifying portfolio-specific “bad”\nstress scenarios in order to “be sure not to miss out any harmful but plausible scenarios,\nwhich is a serious danger when considering only standard stress scenarios.” The authors\nassume factor returns are elliptically distributed and then use the Mahalanobis distance\n(between the scenario and the “mean” economic path) as a measure of plausibility. (Flood\n& Korenko, 2010) propose an alternative methodology, also under the assumption ellipti-\ncally distributed factors, but based on an efficient grid search. While these papers pre-\nsents specific approaches to finding stress scenarios, the difficulty in identifying “univer-\nsally stressful” scenarios has also led to more general proposals by regulators for “reverse\nstress testing,” in which a firm is required to search for scenarios representing states of\nthe world that would result in high losses on the firm’s individual portfolio (cf., (FSA,\n2008)). We discuss this topic briefly in Section 4.2.\nTo delve a bit deeper into the scenario ordering problem, in the next sub-section we de-\ncompose macro-economic stress scenarios along two dimensions: 1) the number of fac-\ntors included in the stress scenario (i.e., a single factor or more than one factor); and 2)\nthe number of (time) periods over which the factors are projected. Both of these attributes\naffect the ability to order scenarios.\n11 Even here, it is easy to construct cases in which the severity of two simple scenarios is reversed for two portfolios. A trivial way to\naccomplish this is to create two portfolios on identical assets and to reverse the direction of the position (long or short) in the second\nportfolio for every asset in the first portfolio.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R.

However, if we add another factor (or two, three,…), the presence of multiple\nfactor loadings for each asset makes determining the severity ordering for scenarios more\ninvolved.\nFor example, imagine two scenarios\nA. U.S. national home prices drop by 5%. Each State experiences a 5% decline\nB. U.S. national home prices drop by 4.5%. Each State experiences a 4% decline but New York ex-\nperiences a 25% decline.\nDetermining which scenario is “worse” is not straightforward. For many portfolios, sce-\nnario B, which involves a national home price decline of only 4.5% is less stressful than\nscenario A, which involves a 5% national home price decline. However, for a New York-\nbased banking institution that is heavily exposed to NY real estate, scenario A, with a 5%\ndecline in national home prices may actually be preferred to the 4.5% national decline\nunder Scenario B, since the decline for NY properties under Scenario B is 25% versus\nonly 5% under Scenario A.\n3.2.2 Cross-portfolio coherence of scenarios of more than one period\nThe time dimension raises similar, but a bit more subtle issues. Imagine three 10-year\nhome price stress scenarios12:\nA. Slowdown in growth, but growth remains positive: Home prices rise ½% each year over 10 years.\nB. Prices drop: Home prices decline by 5% over five years (ending in year 5 at pre-decrease levels\nminus 5%). After year 5, prices rise at 4.5% per year.\nC. Prices drop severely: Home prices decline by 25% over the first three years and then rise to pre-\ndecrease levels minus 5% over the subsequent two years. After year 5, prices rise at 4.5% per year.\nThese three scenarios are shown in each of the panels of Figure 1.\n12 This example is based on one given in (Chinchalkar & Stein, 2010).\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 12DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nFigure 1 The impact of multi-period stress scenarios on different mortgage\ntypes\nAlso shown are the coupon reset dates for three homogenous portfolios of mortgages:\n1. A portfolio of 3/27 loans (loans that pay a low fixed coupon payment for the first three years and\nthen convert to a floating coupon, with a typically higher interest payment);\n2. A portfolio of 5/25 loans (loans that pay a low fixed coupon payment for the first five years and\nthen convert to a floating coupon, with a typically higher interest payment); and\n3. A portfolio of 7/1 loans (loans that pay a low fixed coupon payment for the first seven years and\nthen convert to a floating coupon, with a typically higher interest payment) that resets each year.\nFor simplicity, in this example, we will focus one dimension of loan performance: pay-\nment resets (and the borrower’s ability to refinance to avoid resetting to a higher monthly\ncoupon payment). We also assume that most borrowers tend repay their loans when cou-\npon rates reset at the end of the fixed-rate period.13 However, it can be difficult to refi-\nnance a mortgage when the value of the property is less than the face value of the loan.\n13 This is consistent with data on loan prepayments, which typically exhibit a major spike around the time of the rate reset. However,\nempirically, after month 12, there is often also a much more modest increase in prepayments as borrowers with lower FICO scores\ntake advantage of their newly established track record of mortgage payments to re-negotiate.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 13DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nThis implies that when home prices have declined substantially, the risk is highest that\nthe borrower will not be able to refinance and will thus be forced to accept higher interest\npayments, which, in turn, place a higher financial burden on the borrower.\nWhen we consider the three scenarios generically, it is clear that scenario C (prices drop\nseverely) is worse than scenario B (prices decline) since the peak-to-trough home price\ndecline is more severe in scenario C than in B, and the two are identical after year five.\nScenario A (slowdown in growth, but growth remains positive) would be viewed by many\nas the least stressful. From the figure, though, it is obvious that the timing and levels of\nhome prices affect the reset risk of each type of mortgage differently.\nFrom a reset risk perspective, Figure 1 shows that given the different structure of the ex-\nposures in each portfolio, there is no clear ordering of worst or best scenarios. The sce-\nnario orderings for each portfolio are summarized in Table 2, and discussed in more de-\ntail in the Appendix.\nTable 2 Summary of implied reset risk on different mortgage portfolios under\ndifferent stress scenarios\nPortfolio 1 (3/27) Portfolio 2 (5/25) Portfolio 3 (7/23)\nHighest reset risk in C B or C A\nLowest reset risk in A A B or C\nFrom the table, it is clear that regardless of the probability associated with a specific eco-\nnomic outcome, the impact on reset risk will be high or low (i.e., that the scenario will be\nstressful) depending on the structure of the loans in the portfolio being analyzed. It\nshould also be clear that for any scenario chosen to stress portfolios, there is another sce-\nnario that is as bad or worse for others.\nIn this example, we only focused on the borrower’s ability to avoid increases in monthly\ninterest payments by prepaying. Clearly, losses on real loans and loan portfolios are gov-\nerned by a host of other behaviors that interact in a variegated fashion.14 All of these can\naffect the ordering of losses under different scenarios for a specific portfolio. The high\ndimensional nature of the asset behavior makes the ordering problem more acute.\n3.3 A schematic for the ease of ranking scenarios\nWe can generalize our discussion of scenario ranking, albeit in a stylized fashion. In\nFigure 2, we construct a 2×2 matrix that outlines the stress scenario dimensions we have\nbeen discussing. The x-axis defines the number of factors used in constructing the stress\nscenario and the y-axis describes the number of periods.\n14 For example, the default probability of a 5/25 mortgage with a 70% LTV is clearly affected by a 25% decline in home prices differ-\nently than a mortgage with an LTV of 85%. After the decline, the borrower on the 70% LTV loan still retains approximately 5% eq-\nuity in the home, while the borrower on the 85% LTV home is underwater with significant negative borrower’s equity of approxi-\nmately -10%. This difference materially affects the borrower’s propensity to default, as do numerous other loan and borrower-\nattributes.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 14DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nFigure 2 Schematic describing scenarios characteristics and ease of ranking\nStarting in the upper left, the quadrant represents those assets for which, in general, we\ncan rank single-factor single period scenarios.15 These cases apply to assets that do not\nexhibit path dependence of the sort in our mortgage example. Moving down to the lower\nleft, if we extend the single period framing to a multiple period one, but remain in a sin-\ngle-factor world, we can now add path dependent assets, provided they are homogeneous\nin their characteristics (both within and across portfolios).\nIn the upper right, we move to a multi-factor world, but revert back to a single-period\nscenario (this would be analogous to “shocking” a number of key macro variables). In\nthis set-up, there are relatively few assets for which we can rank scenarios. Those assets\nare characterized as being homogeneous and non-path dependent. Finally, the lower right\nrepresents the richest (and most realistic) set of scenarios that allow for multiple factors\nand a multi-period setting. This set-up permits the most detailed representation of asset\nbehavior, but at the cost of forgoing any practical ability to rank scenarios in a manner\nthat is consistent across portfolios.16\nThis returns us to a common mathematical modeling trade-off: the most stylized repre-\nsentations of the world enjoy the nicest analytic regularities, while the most realistic rep-\nresentations are messy and inconvenient to deal with. As our mortgage example demon-\nstrated, it is unfortunate that many assets about which we might be concerned do exhibit\npath dependence. Furthermore, the behaviors of many assets are driven by more than a\n15 Here again, we assume strictly long-only or short-only portfolios.\n16 In a sense, the lack of a consistent ordering is related in some ways, to Arrow’s Impossibility theorem, in which the portfolios are\nthe voters and the scenarios are the alternatives.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 15DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nsingle factor17 and thus different portfolio construction strategies create different state-\ncontingent payoffs. (Duffie, 2010) articulates this succinctly:\nEssentially any stress measurement system is subject to a financial-risk-management analogue of\nthe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, by which increasing the precision of one’s measurement of\none aspect of a system merely increases uncertainty regarding other dimensions of the system.\n…[I]f a regulator measures the exposure of a bank to a 25% change in the value of an asset, the\nbank could buy and sell options on the asset so as to lower this particular exposure, while raising\nits exposure to a 30% change in the value of the asset.\nIn light of observations such as these, it is reasonable to consider how much of a differ-\nence the ranking of scenarios might make. To give some sense of this, we present the re-\nsults of an informal experiment, structured as follows: we took a single (multi-\nfactor/multi-period) scenario and, using a set of linking functions, estimated the portfolio\nlosses under the scenario for a set of mortgage portfolios.18 We then simulated a full loss\ndistribution for each portfolio, using the same linking functions as in the scenario analy-\nsis19. The mortgage portfolios were drawn from a set of RMBS collateral pools.\nBecause we had access to the full loss distribution for each portfolio, we were able to as-\nsign a loss percentile to the stress scenario loss for each portfolio. For example, if under\nthe stress scenario, a Pool X experienced a loss of 15% of par, we would look up 15% in\nthe loss distribution for Pool X to determine what percent of losses were greater than\n15%.\nTo simplify the presentation, we focus on evaluating the amount of capital required so\nthat losses will be no greater than L with probability 1-α. This is commonly referred to as\nthe “1-α value at risk level” or the “1-α VaR.”\n17 Extending the mortgage example a bit more demonstrates this point. Mortgage defaults can be driven not only by home-price\nchanges, but also by the levels and changes of unemployment and interest rates.\n18 The scenario, provided by Moody’s Economy.com, was a severe downturn stress case. It contained national-level interest rates and\nhome price and unemployment series forecasts for several hundred local regions.\n19 The models use macro-economic simulation to generate loss distributions and are described more fully in (Stein, Das, Ding, &\nChinchalkar, 2010).\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R.

It is clear from the figure that, even under identical linking\nfunctions, the probability of exhausting the capital required to “pass” a stress test using\nthis one scenario can vary greatly. For some portfolios (e.g., Pools A and B), this capital\nwould represent a 99.9% VaR, while for others (e.g., Pools H and I), it would offer a far\nweaker buffer, equating to 75 or 80% VaR.\nThe reason for this disparity is that the scenario is both multi-factor and multi-period in\nnature. Thus loans in different geographic regions and loans of different types, ages, etc.\nwill all experience the scenario differently.\n3.4 Behavior of assets in extreme economic environments\nWhile it is clear that stress tests should explore states of the economy beyond those con-\ntained in the historical record, in some cases, acknowledging that the macro-economic\nenvironment can be different and potentially worse than those observed in the historical\nrecord is not sufficient. In many settings, borrower and market behaviors also change ma-\nterially during a crisis in ways that do not permit simple extrapolation of the relationships\nobserved during normal or even “pretty bad” times.\nOn its face, there is nothing new here. Most introductory statistics texts admonish stu-\ndents to carefully distinguish between relatively simpler interpolation problems and more\ntenuous extrapolation ones. However, the point is more subtle. There are at least two\nways in which the world may be different during times of stress than our linking func-\ntions suggest.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 17DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nFigure 4 Hypothetical example of a factor whose relationship to default is not\nclear until a crisis pushes it to new levels\n2 4 6 8 10\nFirst, the underlying relationships between a macro-economic factor and, (e.g.) the de-\nfault rate of an asset may be non-linear in a way that makes it hard to understand the true\nrelationship from historical data. Figure 4 shows an example of this type of “different”\nbehavior during a crisis. In this example, it is not until a key macro-economic factor be-\ngins to move above its historical range (during a crisis) that the fuller shape of the rela-\ntionship becomes clear.\nIn a sense, this type of model misspecification is of the traditional “model risk” type and\nfrequent recalibration and validation, along with careful managerial judgment can, at\nleast in part, help to mitigate these limitations. However, a second way in which the real-\nized outcome of a macro-economic stress may deviate from a model’s estimate is that the\nmanner in which individuals and institutions react to the state of the economy and mar-\nkets may change. This type of structural break arises not only from an increase in market\nstress, but also from a fundamental change in behaviors.\nFor example, the recent crisis saw the advent of “jingle mail” – a colloquial term used to\ndescribe strategic default on the part of mortgage holders.20 Historically, borrowers\ntended to be reticent to default on a mortgage for fear of the social stigma associated with\nforeclosure and for fear of the negative impact a default would have on their credit re-\ncords. However, in the past several years the reported incidence of strategic default has\nincreased significantly as entire neighborhoods found the values of properties falling well\nbelow the values of the mortgages on them21; and as investors in real estate, with no ties\n20 The “jingle” refers to the notion that defaulting borrowers simply drop the keys to a property into an envelope and mail them to the\nlender before walking away from their mortgage.\n21 A recent study (Guiso, Sapienza, & Zingales, 2009) provides an analysis of survey respondents’ reported willingness to default on a\nmortgage, should it be economically sensible to do so. The authors find that “the most important variables in predicting the likelihood\nof a strategic default are moral and social considerations. Social considerations are directly affected by the frequency of foreclosures\n[in the same zip code] and the probability that somebody knows somebody else who strategically defaulted.”\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R.

Furthermore, unless macro conditions are\nalready weak prior to the eruption of the crisis, the vast majority of stress scenarios based\non historical data are not severe enough. Last, stress testing models are not robust, as sta-\ntistical relationships tend to break down during crises.\nHowever, this implies that, in general, the only approach, ex ante, to systematically ac-\ncommodating such structural breaks in building stress-testing models is to apply manage-\nrial judgment and modelers’ subjective views.\nIn light of these types of unobservable dynamics, it can be informative to conduct stress-\ntesting exercises using combinations of both reduced-form and structural approaches. For\nexample, a macro-economic stress scenario can be run and, at the same time, the default\nprobabilities within the linking functions can be increased as well (for certain assets or\nthe entire portfolio) to determine how this might impact the results of the stress test.\nTypically, this will require more than simply (e.g.) doubling the losses on a portfolio, par-\nticularly if path-dependent assets are included. (For example, one could also imagine de-\ncreasing prepayment rates, increasing LGD, adjusting recovery times, assuming that fi-\nnancial guarantees are not honored, etc.) Though such an approach is less satisfying theo-\nretically, it does provide a means to contemplate ex ante unknown structural changes, al-\nbeit in an abstract sense.\n3.5 “Plausibility” and probability\nIn considering probabilistic interpretations of scenario analysis, it is also natural to think\nabout the notion of the plausibility of a stress scenario. The topic of plausibility has been\nexplored in other literature streams in varying contexts.22 In the domain of stress testing,\nit is relevant in that many definitions of a stress test require that the scenarios chosen be\n22The notion of plausibility was particularly actively discussed in the Artificial Intelligence community. For early examples, see\n(Nilsson, 1986) or (Collins & Michalski, 1989) for logical frameworks for calculating plausibility; or (Shafer, 1976) for an approach\nto calculating plausibility as an upper bound on probability in evidential reasoning.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 19DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\n“exceptional, but plausible.” Although these terms are used often, their definitions are not\nalways explicit.23\nIn considering stress testing, some authors (e.g., (Breuer, Jandačka, Rheinberger, &\nSummer, 2008)) take the term to be a statistical one and measure plausibility in terms of\ndeviations from an “average” case. However, such representations may not capture the\npotential for very different outcomes than have been observed historically (or than those\nthat might be generated by a candidate distribution of some sort).\nAn alternative view is that plausibility is more subjective but that reasonable individuals\nshould be able to agree on whether a specific scenario is plausible or not. In this sense,\nplausibility initially involves not the analysis of the precise probability of a scenario oc-\ncurring, but rather simply determining that the scenario is not practically impossible.\nOnce it has been established, that a scenario could take place, the problem reduces again\nto that of assigning probabilities. The admissibility of a stress scenario as “plausible” may\nbe further refined by also stipulating that an exceptional scenario have a sufficiently high prob-\nability to be considered relevant. (To also be “extreme,” the probability must similarly be suffi-\nciently low that it not be something typically encountered in historical data or daily observation.)\nThus, plausibility may be thought of as a probability assignment problem with the added re-\nquirement that a (subjective) probability threshold for plausibility also be defined. There are a\nnumber of mechanisms one might contemplate for both generating and evaluating potential “ex-\nceptional, but plausible” scenarios. However, practically, it may be difficult to elicit useful prob-\nabilities for very rare events, even from experts. This can be particularly so of events with nega-\ntive consequences (cf., (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986)). As such, the assessment of plausibility\nremains challenging and largely subjective for very extreme scenarios.\n4 Discussion of internal risk management and regulatory applications\nDespite some drawbacks as a stand-alone capital allocation measure, stress testing does\nhave a valuable role to play in credit-risk management.\nIn addition to providing a snapshot of the exposures that a firm or markets faces, given a\nspecific scenario, stress testing can provide decision makers with a monitoring tool that\nallows them to measure the relevant credit risks over time, observing trends and changes\nin the risk profile of those entities relevant to their analysis. In this regard, stress testing\nseems well suited to providing both risk managers and senior management with a broad\ndirectional view on the holdings and portfolio of their institution; it can also provide\nregulators with tools to understand the evolution of risk in a regulated entity or across a\nmarket over time.\n23 I am indebted to Mark Flood for suggesting that this topic be included in this paper and for useful discussions on the topic.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 20DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nImportantly, some forms of stress testing may also provide a means to mitigate model\nrisk by enabling intuitive interpretations of states of the world that may cause a portfolio\nor organization to experience high losses. This intuitiveness makes stress testing useful\nin evaluating a model’s behavior in general, and the appropriateness of a model’s linking\nfunctions in particular. Their intuitiveness also permits more transparent communica-\ntions about models and risks and thereby fosters considerations of credit risk as part of a\nfirm’s broader business strategy.\nIn this section, we discuss the role of stress testing in the risk management of individual\ninstitutions’ credit portfolios and strategies as well as its role in aiding regulators in moni-\ntoring the stability of individual institutions and of the financial system overall.\n4.1 The role of stress testing for internal credit-risk management and strategic\nplanning at financial institutions\nStress testing provides a unique means to understanding both risk models and the portfo-\nlios that institutions analyze with them. In fact, even if risk models (e.g., VaR tools) were\nperfect (i.e., had no error associated with their estimates), stress tests would still provide a\nmeasure of intuition that is generally not feasible otherwise.\nThe exercise of selecting factors, creating scenarios and evaluating the impact of those\nscenarios on a portfolio induces a connection to both the models and the risks in the port-\nfolio that is typically far richer than with quantitative portfolio analytics alone. The sce-\nnarios provide intuitive descriptions of states of the world that might occur (but may\nnever have been seen in the historical record) and the losses associated with those states\n(under a linking function). This provides insights into both the model’s behavior and the\ndrivers of credit risk for the portfolio.\nIt is natural to consider using the two approaches in combination. For day-to-day risk\nmanagement, VaR (or Expected Shortfall, …) provides useful mechanisms for sizing\ncapital and for identifying which positions contribute the most to the tail-risk of the port-\nfolio. This also leads naturally to the use of such measures in implementing transfer-\npricing mechanisms within a financial institution. Credit transfer-pricing can be useful as\na common language across the organization for aligning the incentives of those using the\ninstitution’s capital (i.e., those who create risk exposures through lending and trading op-\nerations) and those managing the risk of the institution. This type of transfer-pricing also\nnaturally produces warnings about dangerous concentrations that may be developing in\nthe portfolio and, at the same time, it provides disincentives to originate additional expo-\nsures that contribute to those concentrations.24\nHowever, even the best designed portfolio tools cannot always contemplate states of the\nworld that are very, very different, both in magnitude and character, from those in the his-\n24 See (Bohn & Stein, 2011) for a discussion of transfer pricing as a link between managing the risk of a credit portfolio and the risk of\na financial services franchise.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 21DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\ntorical record (or that are outside of the theoretical constructs of a model). Stress testing\nprovides a bridge to permit just this analysis. It is one of the most direct and intuitive\nways for managers to impart a judgmental overlay on routine risk management.\nStress testing also provides a reality check that can help mitigate some types of model\nrisk. A user can evaluate losses under a stress scenario and compare these to the simu-\nlated distribution of losses (e.g., as in the results shown in Figure 3). If the losses appear\nmuch higher than under most states of the simulation, the user can use this information to\ndelve into the source of the differences. It may also happen that losses under what the\nuser considers to be a very stressful scenario do not appear high compared to those under,\nsay, extreme outcomes in a portfolio simulation. In this case, again, the user can take ad-\nvantage of this information to better understand the drivers of portfolio risk. Differences\nbetween a user’s expectation and the model’s output for a stress case may be due to limi-\ntations of the model. They may also arise because of disagreements about the relative\nlikelihood of the stress case.\nTo this end, recently, (Rebonato, 2010) has proposed a promising approach for develop-\ning coherent subjective probabilities for scenarios to be used on single portfolios. The\napproach relies on the use of Bayesian networks, a form of probabilistic directed graph,\npopularized in the artificial intelligence community in the 1990s, as a means for collaps-\ning and calculating conditional probabilities. A key feature of this approach is the ability\nto reduce the dimensionality of conditional distributions through the careful application\nof Bayes rule. The author recommends eliciting probability distributions from experts for\ncollections of factors that are relevant to a particular portfolio and then using these elic-\nited scenario distributions to form loss distributions for each asset class.\nFor institutions particularly concerned about specific stress scenarios, the results of a\nstress test can also be used as a capital hurdle. That is, an institution may elect to set capi-\ntal levels based on the greater of the stress-test results and the results of, say, VaR analy-\nsis. In this sense, having adequate capital to pass the stress test becomes a necessary, but\nnot sufficient condition.\nUsing both portfolio simulation and scenario-based approaches permits users to combine\nmanagerial and analytic judgment with the portfolio simulation results in a way that is\noften more satisfying and informative that either one alone.\nFinally, as an institution’s senior management develops its business strategy, stress test-\ning can serve as a mechanism to bring to bear insights about the impact of various strate-\ngic options on the risk profile of the firm. Conversely, it can serve to highlight risk man-\nagement challenges for which strategic solutions are sought. Often, financial institutions\nrelegate considerations of risk management to a compliance-based review of a final strat-\negy rather than involving risk managers at the outset as part of the process of developing\nthe strategy itself. Discussion of stress scenarios and stress tests can be useful in strategy\ndevelopment as these discussions may motivate managers to alter business plans in order\nto build more sustainable franchises, as can discussions of trends in stress test results over\ntime.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 22DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nEven in cases in which an organization may have less confidence in the robustness of a\nspecific linking model (particularly when applied to extreme economic outcomes), stress\ntest results can be used to inform a financial institution’s management about on trends in\ntheir credit risk exposure. For example, by forming a time series of stress test results, a\nmanagement team can gain at least directional insight as to whether their franchises may\nbe becoming more or less risky over time25.\nIn addition to exploring the impact on the state of a portfolio (or the whole firm) of a\nmacro-economic stress scenario, stress testing at the strategic level may involve exploring\nthe reaction of a firm to a stress event as well. For example, consider the most extreme\nversion of a reduced form stress scenario. This type of test is perhaps better termed a\n“thought experiment” or “war game.” The scenario might take the form of an open-ended\nquestion such as:26\nThe firm has just lost 10% of its capital, and most of our competitors have also\nlost between 5% and 20% of their capital. Hedge funds are suffering withdrawals\nand are pulling positions back from their prime brokers. How do you respond?\nBy forcing managers to think through this type of scenario, stress testing aids senior\nmanagers in understanding the implications of key strategic decisions. It can also high-\nlight weaknesses in business strategies that make tacit assumptions about how markets\nfunction or about the flexibility with which the firm can operate in them. The observa-\ntions from such stress tests can eventually form the basis for fail-safe plans that better\nprepare an organization for future economic shocks.\n4.2 The role of stress-testing in regulatory monitoring and systemic credit risk\nanalysis\nIt is useful to consider what our observations on stress testing imply from a regulatory\nand systemic risk measurement perspective. Here we focus here in particular on the\nmacro-prudential (systemic) perspective, since much of the preceding discussion on in-\nternal risk management and strategy also applies to regulatory uses of stress testing for\nthe micro-prudential (individual firm) perspective.\n4.2.1 Micro-prudential applications\nBefore leaving the discussion of micro-prudential stress testing, it is useful to reiterate the\ndifficulty of defining one or a few scenarios for use across many portfolios and institu-\ntions. The discussion in Section 3.2 suggests that stress scenarios may need to be tailored\n25 Because the usefulness of such indicators depends heavily on the quality and characteristics of the linking functions, such analyses\nmay best be considered warning flags, rather that being viewed the sole means for performing such analysis.\n26 I am grateful to Joe Langsam for this example.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 23DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nto individual institutions if the goal is to determine the robustness of the institutions\nthemselves to financial shocks. Said differently, each financial institution will likely have\na different set of scenarios that constitute the worst outcomes for their specific portfolios.\nThus, it is not likely that one set of scenarios will be equally relevant (in a credit risk\nsense) to all financial institutions even if the institutions are of similar size and operate in\nsimilar markets.\nFor regulators, the challenge may be to develop scenarios that are rigorous enough to\nprovide confidence in an institution’s resilience, given the risks to which that institution\nis exposed, but at the same time that do not favor or disadvantage any one institution. Re-\nverse stress testing may provide a partial solution, as might the assignment of subjective\nprobabilities, by regulators, to a larger set of stress scenarios as a first approximation to\nensuring that the (different) scenarios used at different institutions have approximately\nthe same (subjective) probabilities.\nThe use of subjective probabilities for a broad set of factor outcomes has the potential to\nresult in a large set of factors and a correspondingly large number of probability assign-\nments. However, by using, for example, the approach described in (Rebonato, 2010), the\ndimensions of the probability space may be reduced considerably. Nonetheless, this ap-\nproach explicitly requires that stress testers enumerate “all relevant factors” for a portfo-\nlio, which, in many realistic settings may be is a difficult task (see footnote 9, for exam-\nple). Also, by construction, applying this approach across portfolios would require a\nlarge enough number of factors to sufficiently blanket all portfolios.\nReverse stress testing offers an alternative, model-driven approach. However, there may\nbe trade-offs here as well. On the one hand, sampling of macro-economic states in search\nof the particularly severe ones can provide macro-economic stress scenarios that are cus-\ntomized for an individual portfolio. Examining these bespoke scenarios can provide new\ninsights into regions of fragility in the portfolio. On the other hand, performing such a\nsearch using more complex macro economic models can produce results that become de-\ncoupled from intuition, reducing the search to a less informative statistical exercise. In\nthis sense, the stress test may actually introduce model risk rather than help mitigate it.\n4.2.2 Macro-prudential applications\nFrom the macro-prudential perspective, the objectives are different than those that focus\non individual banks. While it is clearly regrettable when any institution fails, macro-\nprudential stress tests are most concerned with the failure of one or more of the key links\nin the financial system since failures of such institutions may cascade through the system,\nspreading financial distress. To this end, the goals of stress tests for systemic risk may be\nless ambitious from a precision perspective than in the micro-prudential case, even as the\nimplementation of the systemic stress tests becomes more complex.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R.

Stein 24DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nGiven the large number of institutions potentially involved in such a systemic stress test,\nthe scenarios, by necessity, must be standardized across institutions at the expense of ana-\nlytic detail.27 For example, (Duffie, 2010) has proposed an approach28 that both holds\ngreat promise and appears to be gaining wide acceptance due to its practical feasibility.\nUnder this approach, a regulator requires the most significant N financial institutions to\nreport their exposure to their largest K counterparties under each of M stress scenarios,\nwhere N, K and M are not too large (e.g., O(10)).Under this method, to ensure that asset-\nspecific scenarios could be run, the institutions would choose the K counterparties stress-\nscenario by stress-scenario. Once the results of each scenario had been computed by each\ninstitution, the regulator would then aggregate these results, scenario-wise, to permit the\nregulator to get a snapshot of the state of the financial system “one tick after” the scenario\ntakes place. The method is a general one that could be applied to stress testing many\nforms of risk.\nAn important feature of (Duffie, 2010) is the recursive nature of the method. Conceptu-\nally, if a regulator observes that a non-reporting counterparty appears to represent a large\nexposure for one or more of the reporting entities, the non-reporting entity would then be\nasked to similarly report stress test results for its own exposures (thus effectively becom-\ning a significant entity itself, thereby resulting in N+1 reporting entities).\nFigure 5 Example of network representation of stress test\nHYPOTHETICAL DATA\nAlmost certainly, systemic monitoring will require some form of network analysis as well.\nGiven the number of entities reporting and the myriad of counterparty relationships that\n27 This may be more a statement about the current state of data infrastructure and availability in financial institutions than an immuta-\nble tenant. With appropriate data infrastructure, standards and ontology, in principle it would be possible to run much more detailed\nscenarios. There have been proposals that move in the direction of more common and standardized data infrastructure (cf., (Flood,\n2009); (Gross, 2010)), though implementations of these may take some time.\n28 The approach was actually originally presented informally in 2007.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 25DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nnaturally emerge as a result, a network representation is a natural one. This also affords\nregulators yet another means to combine both reduced-form and structural approaches to\nstress testing.\nFor example, having reviewed the results of tests under an initial stress scenario, a regula-\ntor may identify a specific (e.g.) hedge fund as a systemically important counterparty in\nthe banking system. A reasonable next stress test might be to ask firms to report their hy-\npothetical losses should that fund default for any reason under the same (or different)\nmacro-economic conditions. Such exposures can be determined readily in a network set-\nting. Figure 5 shows an example of one such hypothetical stress test from the network\nperspective. In this hypothetical example, the (non-reporting) hedge fund “Hedge Fund A”\nis of interest systemically, given the large volume of exposures for which it is a counter-\nparty.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the high-dimensional nature of financial markets and the\ninteractions of the instruments, individuals and institutions that make them up imply that\nit is unlikely that the source of some future financial crisis will be exactly the same as, or\neven very similar to, the scenarios that were examined during a stress-testing exercise29.\nSome detractors highlight this as a reason to forgo stress testing entirely. There is an al-\nternative view, however, that argues that even if a future crisis is caused by such a very\ndifferent event, stress testing is still valuable in that, for the scenarios for which stress\ntesting was done, the tests provided a measure protection against just those sorts of\nevents, which is still better than not examining any stress scenarios at all30.\n5 Conclusions\nThe recent increased interest in stress testing among academics, regulators and practitio-\nners has led to much new discussion of the topic in the past several years. While there has\nbeen a sizeable increase in the volume of published research describing stress-testing ap-\nproaches, there has been relatively little in the way of corresponding work on theory. This\npaper does little to change that trend. However, the intent has been to provide some basis\nfor risk managers and regulators to think about the appropriate use of credit stress-testing\nexercises in the context of their broader activities.\nStress testing provides users with a rich palette through which to explore the impacts of\nchanges in the state of the world on the financial performance of portfolios, institutions\nand the broader financial system. However, often, stress scenarios are drawn from the\nrealm beyond historical data and the models estimated on it. This inherently requires that\njudgment be applied in the construction of scenarios, the evaluation of the probabilities of\n29 Indeed, in hindsight, it is interesting to note that over 85% of the banks reporting in a pre-crisis survey did not indicate that they\nperformed residential real-estate-specific stress tests. (Committee on the Global Financial System, 2005).\n30 Darrell Duffie first brought this observation to my attention.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 26DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\nthe scenarios, the linking of scenarios to losses and the analysis of the results of the stress\ntests themselves.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing.\nThe exercise of constructing stress tests require that the parties to the test engage in active\ndiscussion and analysis of all aspects of the stress scenarios, the models that translate\nthem into portfolio or institutional losses and the interpretation of the results. As a quali-\ntative component of a risk-management program, stress testing and scenario analysis pro-\nvide an important complement to quantitative risk-management approaches. The acces-\nsible, intuitive nature a stress scenario and the resulting stress test result also provide a\nbridge between discussions of credit risk and discussions of strategy that senior manage-\nment can use to evaluate the impact of different business options on their firm’s risk ap-\npetite.\nIt is also reasonable to expect that the increased application of stress testing – both by in-\nstitutions as part of a risk-management program and by regulators as a means to under-\nstanding the fragility of a single institution or the broader financial system – will lead to\nimprovements in information technology, data quality and data infrastructure. These im-\nprovements will have benefits that extend beyond transparency and risk management.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M.

Stein 29DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\n7 Appendix: Details of scenario orderings from example in Section\n3.2.2\nRecall that three 10-year home price stress scenarios the scenarios are defined as follows:\nA. Slowdown in growth, but growth remains positive: Home prices rise ½% each year over 10 years.\nB. Prices drop: Home prices decline by 5% over five years (ending in year 5 at pre-decrease levels\nminus 5%). After year 5, prices rise at 4.5% per year.\nC. Prices drop severely: Home prices decline by 25% over the first three years and then rise to pre-\ndecrease levels minus 5% over the subsequent two years. After year 5, prices rise at 4.5% per year.\nThe three homogenous portfolios of mortgages are defined as follows:\n1. A portfolio of 3/27 loans (loans that pay a low fixed coupon payment for the first three years and\nthen convert to a floating coupon, with a typically higher interest payment).\n2. A portfolio of 5/25 loans (loans that pay a low fixed coupon payment for the first five years and\nthen convert to a floating coupon, with a typically higher interest payment);\n3. A portfolio of 7/1 loans (loans that pay a low fixed coupon payment for the first seven years and\nthen convert to a floating coupon, with a typically higher interest payment) that resets each year.\nConsider now how these scenarios affect Portfolio 1 (3/27 loans) and Portfolio 2 (5/25\nloans). For both portfolios, Scenario A is the least disruptive from a refinancing perspec-\ntive. As the coupon reset approaches, loans in both portfolios have realized positive eq-\nuity growth and (assuming if refinancing makes sense from an interest-rate environment\nstandpoint) positive equity will allow them to refinance in order to avoid increased cou-\npon payments.\nThe other scenarios are less clear:\n• For Portfolio 1 (3/27 loans), scenario C (prices drop severely) is far more chal-\nlenging than Scenario B (prices drop) and refinance risk will be higher under C\nthan B. This is true because at the very time the interest payments on the mort-\ngage are due to reset to a higher rate in year 3, the borrower has experienced sub-\nstantial declines in the value of home equity. Home prices have dropped 25%\nsince origination and for many borrowers, their mortgages will be “underwater.”\nThus, even though they would like to refinance, they may not be able to, due to\nthe negative equity. This is shown in the upper left panel of Figure 1.\nIn contrast, under Scenario B (prices drop) these same borrowers will have ex-\nperienced a much smaller decrease in equity, making refinancing still sensible in\nmany cases. For these borrowers, the sharp increase in coupon payments will be\navoided.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R. M. Stein 30DRAFT: COMMENTS WELCOME\n• For Portfolio 2 (5/25 loans), both Scenario B and Scenario C affect losses simi-\nlarly. This is because by the time the loans reset in year 5, home prices are the\nsame level under both scenarios and they then move identically in both cases.\nThis is shown in the upper right panel of Figure 1.\nNow consider how the three scenarios affect Portfolio 3 (7/1 loans, shown in the lower\nleft panel of Figure 1). In this case, either one of the “bad” scenarios (Scenario B or C) is\nslightly preferable to Scenario A (slowdown in growth, but growth remains positive). To\nsee why consider that when the loans in the portfolio are due for rate resets in year 7, the\nhome prices under Scenarios B and C will have experienced continued growth at 4.5%\nper year, which, starting from a 5% decline in year 5, puts the home prices at about 3.75%\nover the initial value. In contrast, under Scenario A, the 10 year growth has been a bit\nslower with seven years of 0.5% growth resulting prices levels of about 3.5%. Thus, un-\nder Scenario A, the loans in Portfolio 3 will have experienced a bit less home price ap-\npreciation than under B or C.\nFigure 1, reproduced below, shows these relationships.\nThe role of stress testing in credit-risk management, R.
