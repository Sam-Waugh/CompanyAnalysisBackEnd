With the trust of the blockchain and digital asset ecosystem,\nstablecoins have gained significant popularity, exceeding a market cap of $100 billion USD and finding themselves in headlines\nwith traditional finance heavyweights such as Visa and PayPal 1. Despite their ubiquity, questions of regulation, comingling of\nfunds, and opaque reporting, paired with the market trauma of Terra-Luna’s TerraUSD $18 billion collapse 2, has led the core\npremise of stablecoins to be questioned: how stable are stablecoins?\nThe need to answer this question extends far beyond academic curiosity. Risk managers in the digital asset ecosystem are\nincreasingly recognizing that stablecoins, due to their widespread adoption, have effectively become the lifeblood of decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) ecosystems 3. These digital assets underpin a wide array of financial activities, including payments, lending,\nborrowing, and trading. Consequently, their stability is not merely a matter of theoretical interest; it is an essential component of\nfinancial security that risk managers bear the responsibility of assessing effectively.\nAs an emerging asset acting as an experiment for broader real-world asset tokenization, an underwhelming number of risk opinions\nand analytics are available for stablecoins. While tracking price data and on-chain movement has been the go-to approach for\nmany, these signals are often delayed or near-time to depegging events, and capture a fraction of the risk points inherent to the\nstablecoin infrastructure depicted in figure 1, leading to reactionary policies made after the fact, rather than proactive and\ndefensive risk decisions. It is essential for any stablecoin risk management process to not only address on-chain transactions,\nmarket-depth, and liquidity, but also monitor the critical supporting components allowing for proper minting and redemption\nincluding the risk profile of the off-chain real-world assets collateralizing the token, the financial health of the issuer, and the\nfinancial health of entities providing custodial relationships.\nFigure 1 Stablecoin Ecosystem Summary\nThe DeFi Integrated Risk Assessment (DIRA) model proposed here seeks to provide a near-time framework for wholistic risk\nmonitoring of stablecoins. Developed from the ground-up around stablecoin infrastructure, the model combines real-time on-\nchain events and market data, with off-chain financial health indicators of issuers, reserve assets and custodial partners to provide\na forward-looking 24-hour probability of depegging for a given stablecoin.\n1 According to data by CoinGecko (coingecko.com), tokens belonging to the stablecoin category had a total market cap of $ 123,520,962,269 as of October 25, 2023.\n2 (Sandor & Genc, 2022)\n3 (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, 2022)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 3MOTIVATION\nThe DIRA model is built as an adaptation of previous risk frameworks proposed by Moody’s Investor Services and Moody’s\nAnalytics for the digital asset ecosystem. In a July 2023 Sector in-Depth report by Moody’s Investors Service4, an analysis of the\ndigital bonds market is provided, and in it, four key risks are identified for digital bonds: platform risk (solution resiliency and\nbusiness continuity planning), smart contract risk (smart contract design and error correction), asset representation risk (transfer of\nproperty rights and creditor’s rights), and external risk (regulatory and cyber). In addition to these risks, the authors suggest\nconventional risk assessment for bonds should be applied as well.\nThe second framework which influenced the DIRA model was a previous framework proposed jointly by Moody’s Analytics and\nGauntlet for risk analysis of decentralized finance5. In this framework, two high level risk categories are proposed with specific risks\nunderlying each category: Systemic risks (security contracts, governance, oracles, and cooperative risk) and idiosyncratic risks\n(currency, regulatory, and blockchain risks).\nBoth frameworks indicate a high-level need for any digital asset risk assessment: traditional financial assessment, paired with\nassessment of infrastructure and external threats.\nDefining a Depegging Event\nUnlike defaults and currency uncouplings, stablecoin depeggings lack a long-history of an agreed upon definition. At the same\ntime, depegging events are the primary vehicle of loss for the asset, and developing both a common and robust definition of the\nterm among industry players will enable more effective and comprehensive risk management processes for decision-making\naround stablecoins.\nIn the DIRA framework, a depegging event is defined as the following: Over a specified time-frame, a depegging\nevent is said to occur if a stablecoin is traded at a maximum high or minimum low in excess of a decoupling\nthreshold on any major exchange or liquidity pool. In DAM and the analysis of DIRA, a time-frame of 24 hours and\na threshold of 3% is adopted, informed by best practices seen in the FX market.\nThrough the explicit definition of depegging, associated risks of stablecoins, which have been derived from the works outlined\nabove, can be quantified to frequency and magnitude of depegging events. \\\nFRAMEWORK\nThe DIRA model aims to identify the internal operational and financial risk points critical to maintenance of a stablecoin peg\n(figure 2), and combine these factors with the external market conditions that can lead to excessive stress on this infrastructure,\nultimately leading to a depegging event. Generalizability and the ability to quantify risks across fiat-backed stablecoins was a\ncritical design element to allow for precise benchmarking and comparison of the emerging asset.\n4 (Gusdorf, Dyck, Colzani, & Berlot, 2023)\n5 (Francus, Chitra, Hamilton, & Dobel, 2022)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 4Figure 2 Risk In the Stablecoin Ecosystem\nBeyond quantification, timely analysis is an essential component for any effective risk framework. Timeliness is especially relevant\nfor the “always on” financial ecosystem and instantaneous settlement that is blockchain. Informed by the historic rapid collapse of\non-chain assets such as FTX token6, all DIRA-native risk metrics are 24-hours forward looking and capable of data-informed and\nautomated assessment. Refresh rates and forward-looking probabilities for each sub-model are discussed in detail for their\nrespective section.\nIn addition to the DIRA-native risk models developed around market and on-chain events, DIRA also significantly leverages the\nEDF-X Early Warning System7 for monitoring the credit risk of both the issuing entity of the stablecoin, as well as those of the\nfinancial institutions with custodial responsibilities to the reserve assets, as disclosed in public attestations by the issuer.\nCombining a series of existing credit models, EDF-X, Moody’s risk management platform, provides a standard, point-in-time\nprobability of default for listed entities on a daily basis, and private entities on a monthly basis8. A comparative trigger value from\nEDF-X9 is integrated into the system for benchmarking financial performance against a peer group. Figure 3 depicts the flow of\ndata and primary model used against each signal.\n6 (Davis, 2023)\n7 EDF-X is a risk management platform developed by Moody’s Analytics. Full product information and details can be found at edfx.com.\n8 (Hamilton, Pieschacon, Xu, & Zhuang, 2022)\n9 The trigger is derived from a probability of default percentile based on country and industry peer groups and accounts for the current credit cycle (Hamilton, Pieschacon, Xu, &\nZhuang, 2022)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 5Figure 3 DIRA Model Overview\nMarket-Informed 24-hour Probability of Depegging (MIPD)\nThe market-informed 24-hour probability of depegging acts as a predictive risk indicator informed by trading and price\nfluctuations in both individual stablecoins and broader digital asset market trends, in-practice, assessing the intra-day volatility of\na token. To produce the model, a light gradient boosting machine classifier was trained using daily open, high, low, close prices and\nvolume (OHLCV) profiles for selected stablecoins in combination with OHLCV profiles for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). This data\nwas then paired with the 24-hour forward looking Boolean indicator for the occurrence of a depegging event.\nGiven the OHLCV profiles used in training, the model produces a 24-hour forward-looking probability of depegging for a\nstablecoin. In addition to a numeric score, the model produces a categorization of “Low”, “Moderate”, or “High” risk indicator\nbased on the 25% and 90% bounds as observed in the model backtesting.\nLiquidity-Informed 24-hour Probability of Depegging (LIPD)\nSimilar to the market-informed model, the liquidity informed 24-hour probability of depegging acts as a predictive risk indicator\ninformed instead by on-chain activity of the stablecoin. To produce the model, a light gradient boosting machine classifier was\ntrained using on-chain metrics including supply, total value locked in smart contracts, and percentage of tokens held by top\nholders. These metrics, in combination with several others as listed in Appendix 1 were selected for their correlations with on-chain\nliquidity crunches, and the ability for token holders to exit their position via on-chain methods, especially in stressed market\nscenarios. The liquidity data set was trained and paired with the same 24-hour forward looking Boolean indicator for the\noccurrence of a depegging event as seen in the market-informed model.\nFor prediction, the model takes as an input the liquidity indicators used for model training, producing a numeric 24-hour forward-\nlooking probability of depegging for a stablecoin. Again, the model produces a categorization of “Low”, “Moderate”, or “High” risk\nindicator based on the 25% and 90% bounds as observed in the test data set.\nIssuer 1-year Probability of Default (IPD)\nThe ability of a stablecoin to maintain its peg relies significantly on the ability and presence of the issuer to maintain operations of\nminting and burning, as well as keep the token in good-standing through regulatory requirements; therefore, understanding the\nfinancial health of the operating issuer can be a forward looking signal in predicting stability and future depegging events for a\ntoken. The issuer 1-year probability of default is estimated by EDF-X using market data and entity financials where available. The\nmodel also provides a trigger value for producing risk categorizations.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 6The DIRA framework derives issuing entity names directly from the latest financial attestation regarding a given stablecoin. Issuing\nentity names are then mapped to Orbis Database Identifiers, which are fed into the EDF-X EWS. Risk benchmarks are derived from\nEDF-X provided benchmarks based on the mappings in table 1.\nTABLE 1 EDF-X RISK CATEGORIZATION MAPPINGS\nEDF-X EWS IPD\nLow Low\nModerate Moderate\nHigh High\nSevere High\nAggregate Custodian 1-year Probability of Default (ACPD)\nJust as the ability of an issuer to perform timely minting and burning is critical to the peg of a stablecoin, the solvency and ability\nto fulfill “stablecoin runs” by the entities providing custodial services for collateralizing the peg are essential. As seen in the run on\nUSD Coin (USDC), which moved the stablecoin’s price below $0.90 in March of 2023, and linked to the bankruptcy\nannouncement of custodian Silicon Valley Bank10, market faith in a stablecoin’s custodians can lead to the direct depegging of that\ntoken.\nAccounting for this critical risk point, DIRA incorporates the regular monitoring of custodial partner insolvency risk through 1-year\nprobability of defaults, as provided by EDF-X EWS. In a similar method to issuer assessment, custodians are derived using the latest\nreserve attestation report of an issuer, and again mapped to Orbis IDs, allowing for the retrieval of the entities 1-year probability of\ndefault. The aggregate custodian probability of default is then calculated using\n𝑛𝑛\n∑𝑖𝑖=1𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖\nP = 𝑛𝑛\n∑𝑖𝑖=1𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖\nWhere Pi is the 1-year probability of default for a custodian, Vi is the USD market-value of the reserve assets held by the\ncustodian, and n is the number of custodians. For those issuers that do not specify where specific reserve assets are held, the value\nheld by each listed custodian is assumed to be equal, simplifying to\n𝑛𝑛\n∑𝑖𝑖=1𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖\nP =\nFor those issuers that do not disclose their custodial partners, no sco𝑛𝑛re can be calculated. Benchmark values of ‘Low’, ‘Moderate’,\nand ‘High’ are also produced through a similar aggregation using individual trigger values for custodians rather than probability of\ndefaults.\nAggregate Reserve 1-year Probability of Default (ARPD)\nThe final, and possibly most fundamental, sub-model in the DIRA framework is the assessment of the collateral of a stablecoin, the\nreserves. Going beyond the market value of the reserves, DIRA utilizes an aggregation of the probability of default for reserve\nassets to understand the liquidity of reserve assets, and ultimately their adequacy to meet redemption requirements.\nReserve contents are derived using the latest attestation provided by the issuing entity and audited by a 3rd party. The assessment\nof reserves in DIRA framework requires that (a) total collateral market value is disclosed, (b) all collateral assets are either cash,\ncash-equivalents, or bonds, and (c) all non-cash assets acting as collateral are disclosed with identifiers when applicable. When\nthese conditions are met, each asset is assigned an associated risk level, either using (a) the asset’s Moody’s Investors Service (MIS)\ncredit rating, (b) the issuing entities MIS credit rating, or (c) for cash only, the issuing country’s MIS credit rating. Each is risk level is\n10 (Howcroft & Jaiswal, 2023)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 7then converted to implied probability of defaults as informed by a Moody’s Analytics analysis of historical credit rating default\nfrequencies11. Once risk levels are mapped to their implied probability of defaults, the aggregate reserve 1-year probability of\ndefault is calculated using\n𝑛𝑛\n∑𝑖𝑖=1𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖\nP = 𝑛𝑛\n∑𝑖𝑖=1𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖\nWhere Pi is the assumed probability of default for an asset, Ri is the market value of the asset as disclosed by the issuer, and n is\nthe total number of assets in the reserve.\nDIRA 24-hour Probability of Depegging (DIRA-PDep)\nParameterized by the sub-models listed above, the DIRA 24-hour probability of depegging indicator acts as a predictive, integrated\nsignal for depegging risk, informed and trained by the sub-model outputs of DIRA. To produce the output model, a logistic\nregression classifier was trained using as an input the daily results of each sub-model for each token. The 24-hour forward looking\nBoolean indicator for the occurrence of a depegging event was paired once again with this set, enabling training of the DIRA\nmodel.\nGiven the outputs of the DIRA sub-models, the DIRA model produces a net 24-hour forward-looking probability of depegging for a\nstablecoin. Once again, the model produces a categorization of “Low”, “Moderate”, or “High” risk indicator based on the 25% and\n90% bounds as observed in the test data set.\nTABLE 2 DIRA MODEL INPUT PARAMETERS\nINPUT NAME ASSOCIATED SUB-MODEL\nDate / Time N/A\nMarket-informed 24-hour probability of depegging MIPD\nMarket-informed risk categorization MIPD\nLiquidity-informed 24-hour probability of depegging LIPD\nLiquidity-informed risk categorization LIPD\nIssuer 1-year probability of default IPD\nIssuer-informed risk categorization IPD\nAggregate custodian 1-year probability of default ACPD\nCustodian-informed risk categorization ACPD\nTABLE 3 DAM MODEL SPECIFICATION AND FREQUENCIES\nMODEL NAME SYSTEM FREQUENCY DATA AVAILABILITY FREQUENCY\nMIPD Hourly Real-Time\nLIPD Hourly Real-Time\nIPD Monthly Monthly\nACPD Daily Daily\nARPD Daily Real-Time12\nDIRA-PDep Hourly Real-Time\nDAM Issuer Transparency Index\nThe DAM system provides an additional metric independent of the DIRA framework, specifically to contextualize and provide\nvisibility into DIRA assessments.

This is\nespecially relevant to providing context to missing or outdated scores, and highlights the need for standardization of best practices\nfor stablecoin operations and investor protections.\nThe transparency index is calculated using\n𝑛𝑛\n∑𝑖𝑖=1𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖\nTI = � �\n𝑛𝑛\nwhere Xi is the assigned value for each transparency item categorization and n is the number of transparency items. Full\ntransparency checks are included in table 4.\nTABLE 4 TRANSPARENCY INDEX CRITERIA\nTRANSPARENCY ITEM CATEGORY\n(I) Legal issuing entity identifiable in Orbis company database - Yes\n- No\n(II) Publication of stablecoin collateral attestations - Yes\n- No\n(III) Frequency of Attestations - Up to Daily\n- Up to Monthly\n- Quarterly or more\n(IV) Disclosure of Custodians - Yes with balances\n- Yes without balances\n- No\n(V) Disclosure of Reserves Assets - Yes with asset details\n- Yes without asset details\n- No disclosure of collateral assets\nDATA\nDepegging Event Methodology\nIn the assessment and training of DIRA, an initial historical set of depegging events was required. The dataset was first developed\nthrough the collection of open, high, low, close and volume (OHLCV) trading pair profiles on an hourly basis for a set of covered\nspot exchanges and DeFi liquidity pools13. Covered pairs included the combination of each stablecoin in the experiment set with\nUS Dollars (USD), Tether (USDT), TrueUSD (TUSD), and USD Coin (USDC), both in base and quote positions. Once all profiles are\ncollected, OHLC prices are normalized, first converting all non-USD base pairs to USD, then convering all non-USD stablecoins to\ntheir respective currencies using daily foreign exchange rates.\nFollowing normalization, an aggregation method is employed on a daily basis for each token, producing an aggregate OHLCV\nprofile, where a weighted average price is used for open and close values, a sum is used for volume, and a maximum and minimum\nare used for high and low prices, respectively. Each profile is then assessed for a depegging event using the definition described\nabove. Stablecoins included and generalized data can be found in table 5.\nIntroducing Value at Risk (VAR) Metrics\nBeyond understanding simply the occurrence of a depegging event, a secondary metric is also introduced to better understand the\npotential impact and depth of a depegging event. The Value at Risk (VAR) calculation aims to identify the potential for loss to a\nparty participating in an uncoupled stablecoin trade. In the DIRA framework, Value at Risk is defined as:\n13 Reference exchanges are provided by Amberdata, Inc.

In the DIRA analysis below and in DAM, a time frame of 24 hours is adopted and is calculated at the\naggregate profile level, using only a single profile for a VAR analysis. Two methods for calculating VAR are introduced, High VAR\nwhich utilizes the high price of an OHLCV profile, and Open VAR which utilizes the open price of an OHLCV profile.\nTABLE 5 TRAINING DATA SET\nTOKEN SYMBOL NUMBER OF RECORDS NUMBER OF DEPEG PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL OPEN VAR TOTAL MAX VAR (USD)\nEVENTS DEPEG EVENTS (USD)\nBUSD 840 573 68% $1,418,211,613 $53,173,000,000\nDAI 168 119 71% $9,144,165 $1,090,736,303\nEUROC 447 274 61% $7,717,834 $20,151,838\nEUROe 167 7 4% $63,403 $107,993\nEURS 840 543 65% $191,801,924 $319,159,324\nEURT 840 606 72% $272,508,687 $1,086,796,072\nFDUSD 261 0 0% $866,605 $8,246,062\nFRAX 168 129 77% $9,303,876 $78,772,813\nGBPT 434 109 25% $1,365,604 $1,513,377\nGUSD 840 206 25% $2,699,492 $14,387,404\nIDRT 341 46 13% $2,146 $2,565\nLUSD 168 56 33% $3,992,778 $16,287,762\nMXNT 458 260 57% $62,877 $77,112\nOUSD 168 5 3% $12,208 $33,081\nPYUSD 261 5 2% $7,989 $391,814\nQCAD 26 2 8% $5,092 $644\nTAUD 722 55 8% $11,375 $12,440\nTCAD 660 15 2% $352 $397\nTGBP 840 149 18% $21,782 $23,744\nTHKD 82 8 10% $381 $412\nTUSD 840 187 22% $135,436,505 $2,801,970,749\nUSDC 840 535 64% $1,380,863,176 $57,255,000,000\nUSDD 168 27 16% $5,182,151 $26,058,804\nUSDP 261 44 17% $13,506,171 $62,529,473\nUSDT 840 192 23% $1,020,443,225 $20,231,000,000\nXCHF 840 420 50% $851,986 $1,082,721\nXIDR 661 331 50% $3,525 $3,525\nXSGD 840 643 77% $73,155,577 $82,336,590\nZUSD 261 7 3% $11,817 $27,643\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 10Figure 4 Observed frequency of depegging by stablecoin\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nRESULTS\nAfter conducting model training and selection, assessment was performed primarily on the Overall DIRA model, as well as the\nDIRA-native MIPD and LIPD models.

The primary assumption to account for was historical\nknowledge of custodian relationships and reserve assets, which lack a complete, standardized, and historical dataset today15. Given\nthese parameters exist in non-standard attestations, accurate custodians and reserve assessments in the DIRA model training set\nonly date back to January 1, 2022. All training data before this period assumes the same set of known custodians and a similar\nreserve makeup.\n15 Public data availability of off-chain reserves and custodial relationships are at the issuer’s discretion. This can impact the outcomes of the model, and issuer transparency indices\ncan be used to understand underlying data availability.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 16A secondary limitation is in the analysis of VAR, in the precision and level with which it is calculated. In a more robust analysis of\nthis metric, calculation should instead be performed at the order-book level, using\n𝑡𝑡\n𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑅𝑅 = �\n𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖(1\n−\n𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖)\n𝑖𝑖=1\nWhere vi is the volume of an individual trade, pi is the price of the asset in the pegged currency, and t is the total transactions for\nthe stablecoin. In this assessment, VAR is a secondary comparative indicator, and does not implement this level of precision due to\navailability of data.\nA final limitation to note in the overall DIRA framework is tracking of covered exchanges. Due to tracking OHLCV profiles at the\nexchange-level rather than the overall-market level, DIRA is inherently limited by the number of exchanges that can be monitored\nand covered. In the DAM system, over 90% of trade volume is covered in its historical exchange monitoring16.\nFUTURE WORK\nOpportunities for multi-dimensional, categorized depegging\nThe current DIRA framework, and it’s associated prediction models, performs Boolean assessment across two dimensions at the\nintersection of two points: a single time horizon, and single depegging threshold, 24 hours and 3% in the DAM system. In truth,\nthe profile of a depegging event covers a wide range of dimensions, which future models may expand to include. Table 7 below\ndescribes potential added dimensions in further detail.\nTABLE 7 DIMENSIONS OF A DEPEGGING EVENT\nCATEGORY POTENTIAL PREDICTION TARGETS\nDuration - Time horizon of forward looking probability\n- Concurrent minutes spent depegged\n- Concurrent trades spend depegged\nDepth - Number of asset pairs depegged\n- Specific asset pairs depegged\nSeverity - Sign / direction of depeg\n- Magnitude of depeg\nLocation - Blockchain of depeg event\n- Exchange of depeg event\nExpansion of DIRA Inputs into Technical Risks\nThe goal of the DIRA framework is to assess both financial and operational risk of an asset. Thanks to the flexibility built into the\nDIRA model, DIRA can quickly be synthesized with additional risk metrics to provide an enhanced integrated assessment of\nstablecoin risk. Two operational points on the roadmap for DIRA are both technical in nature, smart contract risk assessment and\nblockchain risk assessment. While the latter covers a more macro-view of the stablecoins ability to generally operate its minting\nand burning functions in a timely manner, the former can provide a complex look into the capabilities of the issuer, potential\nsecurity concerns, and built-in risk management protections. Ultimately, quantitative risk measurements around technical risk\nfactors will better help to inform risk management decisions.\nExpansion of Real World Assets\nReal World Assets (RWAs) are tokenized tangible assets from the physical world. RWAs can include tokens of real assets like real\nestate, commodities, precious metals and art. RWAs also consist of capital market products such as private credit and U.S.\nTreasuries.\n16 According to CoinGecko (coingecko.com), covered exchanges included 93% of total USD spot-market volume as of October 25, 2023.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 17RWAs reduces transaction costs by eliminating intermediaries and automating processes via smart contracts. It increases liquidity\nby turning traditionally less-liquid assets into tradeable tokens with option of fractional ownership and provides transparency\nthrough an immutable record of transactions.\nToday in private credit, one asset class with high potential for tokenization, the market is valued at $1.5 trillion17; however, only\n0.03% ($0.5 billion)18 of this market is currently represented on the public blockchain, representing a significant opportunity for\nvalue transfer to on-chain systems.\nWhile there is significant opportunity for RWAs, Tokenization faces significant challenges, slowing its widespread adoption.\nPrimarily, these encompass limited infrastructure, high initial implementation costs, market immaturity, need for industry\nalignment and regulatory uncertainty.\nImplications of Non-USD Stablecoins and CBDCs\nStablecoins pegged to the United States Dollar (USD) holds a 99% of the total market share in the stablecoin sector19. The top 5\nstablecoins as of October 2023 are Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Dai (DAI), TrueUSD (TUSD), and Binance USD (BUSD). They\nare all pegged to USD with combined circulating supply of $120 billion. In contrast, the non-USD stablecoin with the highest\nmarket capitalization is Tether EURt (EURT) with $36M market capitalization.\nThe emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has become a significant trend in the global financial landscape. 11\ncountries20 have launched their CBDCs, 21 are in the pilot stage and 33 are in the development stage. This indicates a widespread\ninterest and investment in this new form of digital currency. However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the\ntechnological infrastructure that will underpin these CBDCs, with it being unclear how many will be issued on blockchain. In terms\nof their use, CBDCs are being explored in two main categories: wholesale and retail. Wholesale CBDCs are intended for interbank\npayments and settlements. On the other hand, retail CBDCs are aimed at everyday consumers and businesses, providing a digital\nalternative to physical cash.\nCBDCs have the potential to revolutionize the financial system by providing a new form of digital money that is directly issued by\nthe central bank. The implications of this are particularly significant when considering the size of the money supply in major\neconomies such as the USA and the European Union. As of now, the M1 money supply, which includes physical currency and\ndemand deposits, stands at approximately $18.32 trillion in the USA and €10.55 trillion in the European Union. The introduction of\na CBDC in these economies could potentially digitize a significant portion of this money supply.\nCONCLUSION\nThe DIRA model is an effective predictor of stablecoin depegging events, and incorporation of DAM into digital asset risk\nmanagement processes can provide a more robust, proactive view of potential stablecoin risks. As a model, DIRA is optimized for\nflexibility and generalizability, ultimately achieving automated, near-time risk assessment for a given stablecoin.\nSignals from DAM, Moody’s Analytics’ proprietary monitoring system utilizing DIRA, has potential applications in multiple use\ncases across the digital asset ecosystem. Built for risk assessment; exchanges, wallets, and other custodial platforms can protect\nand inform users, through the integration of DAM into token onboarding processes and ongoing monitoring systems. Payment\nplatforms and other businesses exploring or using stablecoins for transaction purposes can optimize their transaction workflows for\nloss mitigation through DAM-informed stablecoin selection and transaction timing. Finally, on-chain market players can utilize\nDAM in their selection of stablecoins for lending collateral, temporary holding positions between transactions, or use DAM to\nidentify potential arbitrage opportunities.\nGoing forward, there are several potential opportunities to enhance the DIRA framework. A primary focus will be in the addition of\ntechnical-based risk indicators including smart-contract risk assessment and blockchain risk-assessment. Given the overlap of\ninfrastructure between fiat-backed stablecoins and other RWAs, the DIRA model has high potential to expand to new asset classes,\n17 (Lee & Sage, 2023)\n18 As of October 25, 2023, $564,959,407 of active loans were on-chain, according to RWA.xyz\n19 (Lee S. , 2023)\n20 (Atlantic Council, 2023)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 18including tokenized treasuries and over-collateralized stablecoins, such as DAI. Finally, further investigation should be performed\ninto the feasibility of multi-dimensional classification for depegging risk prediction.\nAPPENDIX\nTABLE 8 DIRA SUB-MODEL INPUT PARAMETERS\nINPUT NAME SOURCE RELEVANT MODEL(S)\nDate / Time N/A MIPD, LIPD\nToken Open Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD, LIPD\nToken High Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nToken Low Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nToken Close Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nToken Volume Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD, LIPD\nBTC Open Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nBTC High Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nBTC Low Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nBTC Close Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nBTC Volume Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nETH Open Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nETH High Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nETH Low Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nETH Close Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nETH Volume Spot Markets, DeFi Liquidity Pools MIPD\nCirculating Supply Tracked blockchains LIPD\nFree Float Supply Tracked blockchains LIPD\nTotal Supply Tracked blockchains LIPD\nMax Supply Tracked blockchains LIPD\nTotal Liquidity (Native) Tracked blockchains LIPD\nTotal Liquidity (USD) Tracked blockchains LIPD\nTotal Liquidity Ratio Tracked blockchains LIPD\nMarket Cap Tracked blockchains, Spot Markets LIPD\nAverage Transferred Value (Native) Tracked blockchains LIPD\nAverage Transferred Value (USD) Tracked blockchains, Spot Markets LIPD\nTotal Transferred Value, last 24 hours (Native) Tracked blockchains LIPD\nTotal Transferred Value, last 24 hours (USD) Tracked blockchains, Spot Markets LIPD\nTotal Transfers Tracked blockchains LIPD\nTop 10 Wallet Holder Balance Tracked blockchains LIPD\nTop 10 Wallet Holder Balance Ratio Tracked blockchains LIPD\nIssuing Entity Latest Issuer Attestation IPD\nCustodian Entities Latest Issuer Attestation ACPD\nReserve Assets Latest Issuer Attestation ARPD\nReserve Asset Ratings Moody’s Investors Service ARPD\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS DIGITAL ASSET MONITOR 19REFERENCES\nAtlantic Council.
