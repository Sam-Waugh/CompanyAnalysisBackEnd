(“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Group Japan G.K., which is\nwholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating\nagency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ\nare Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings.
