    "content": "Why you should merge liquidity\nstress testing and IRR\nForecasting potential interest rate impacts on liquidity, deposits\nand earnings\nIn times of economic uncertainty the interest rate cycle can be like a roller coaster ride. The\nslow climbs sometimes induce more panic and more of an adrenaline rush than the sudden\nfalls. It’s not knowing what’s round the next corner that can get to you. And then when you\nhit bottom and get off it takes a while to calm your dizzying head and collect your thoughts:\n“Wow, what happened, I’m back where I started but everything feels different.” During the\npandemic, the unprecedented liquidity stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates\nat record low levels for much of 2021, then we did a loop the loop, and now we are winding\ntowards the top, bracing ourselves for a rate rise at the next meeting of the Fed.Now you really need to ask yourself, what is different about your institution today compared\nwith where you were pre-pandemic, both in terms of balance sheet composition and what\nimpact the various external pressures are having on your customers. What changed when\ninterest rates were at X% – before the decline, when they hit lows, and where are you today?\nThus on the balance sheet you need to be asking questions like:\n“What investments have we made that we didn’t have two months ago?”\n“Do we have credit line commitments that we didn’t have two years ago?”\n“Have we extended/contracted our loan product offerings?”\n“Now we are flush with cash, how has our deposits mix changed? Fewer Treasury\nbonds, more savings, more non-maturity deposits maybe?”\nThe other side is customers. You need to ask how they have had to adapt, especially with\nregard to how they are responding to the highest inflation in 40 years. You need to examine\nwhere customer deposit growth has come from and movement between products.\nLiquidity stress testing\nMost institutions now conduct liquidity stress testing either in their own ALM software or\nthrough a third party. Some have done neither so far, but they are getting there. That may be\nan opportunity to avoid a common error of looking at them separately. What we recommend\nis merging liquidity stress testing with interest rate risk (IRR) analytics: we should not be\noperating in silos. Fundamentally, this involves looking at the two sets of changes mentioned\nabove: what has changed in the balance sheet and how are customers reacting to the new\nenvironment. While liquidity and IRR are not identical, there is significant overlap in the\nfactors to be considered. To start with, dynamic investment cashflow by product types. For\nexample, did you extend your investment in municipal bonds (munis) or collateralized loan\nobligations (CLOs) and if so, how will that look after an interest rate rise, and will you get your\ncashflow back? Munis are among the least liquid assets and hard to maneuver so you may\nfind yourself locked out of investing in other assets such as mortgage-based securities (MBS).\nAlso, if you are using your investments to pledge against deposits that require collateral and\ninterest rates go up, you will be taking a loss so you will need more investments to pledge up\nthe difference.\nAn interest rate rise is also going to impact prepayment speeds on loans for many institutions.\nAnyone who is heavily into adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) is going to find customers\ncoming in and requesting a relock. That’s not only an interest rate risk but also a liquidity risk,\nbecause it is pushing cashflow back out. Likewise with instalment loans such as recreational\nvehicles (RVs) terms are likely to be extended because (who would have guessed it?) used cars\nare actually increasing in value and are therefore less affordable.\nCONTACT US\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS | WHY YOU SHOULD MERGE LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING AND IRRThink also about the customers. Some will be looking to early refinancing e.g. from ARM to\nFRM or other changes (also on other loans) that will impact the institution’s position. With\nrates likely to be going up, customers might want to withdraw cash now to make purchases\nthat will be more costly in future.\nAnd think also about competition with deposit rates. You may be thinking that with all the\nextra liquidity there is no need to change deposit rates; but you really need to quantify this.\nCompare your deposits now with what they were two years ago. Where has the growth in\nthe balances gone? If the growth is not in interest-bearing deposits, and you need to replace\nthose deposits, you are probably going to take a hit on the earnings side because you will\nhave to replace them through borrowings, which now cost a whole lot more than you are\nwilling to pay the customer. So it is worth running some scenarios to see what will be the\nimpact on liquidity of losing various specific quantities of deposits; for example how will\nthings pan out if your top depositors look for a better rate from the bank across the street or\nan internet bank? With inflation, it is certain that customers are going to be looking for more\nvalue.\nIRR is the greatest driver of liquidity risk\nThe point with all of this is that it is only by doing some quantitative analysis that you will\nidentify where you have risks now and the risk implications of any decision that the institution\ntakes. Quantify the individual interest rate and liquidity risks. They really do go hand in hand.\nMost institutions see IRR as the biggest driver of liquidity risk. And then put them together for\na forecast and full stress testing, probably monthly, synced up with your ALM testing, but the\nfrequency will vary by institution depending on a number of factors, notably how tight your\nliquidity position.\nBoth your internal management and the regulators will thank you for it!\nCONTACT US\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS | WHY YOU SHOULD MERGE LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING AND IRRCONTACT US\nFind out more information about Moody’s Analytics award\nwinning products and solutions.\nwww.moodysanalytics.com/contact-us\nCONTACT DETAILS\nVisit us at moodysanalytics.com or contact us at a location below.\nAMERICAS EMEA ASIA (EXCLUDING JAPAN) JAPAN\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com clientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\n© 2022 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
