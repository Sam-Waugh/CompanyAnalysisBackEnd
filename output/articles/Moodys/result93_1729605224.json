The bill includes a\nnumber of provisions to help the millions of workers who were laid off in the wake of social distancing requirements that nearly\nshut down whole industries, including at a minimum hotels, entertainment, most personal services, and all but essential retail.\nRestaurants in most states have been ordered to close their dining rooms, severely restricting their business, and a much larger\nswath of \"nonessential\" industries was ordered to temporarily shut down physical locations in a growing number of states.\nThe need for assistance is particularly great because the affected workers are overwhelmingly concentrated in industries that pay\nthe lowest wages: restaurants, hotels, retail and personal services. Moody’s Analytics expects that the number of unemployed\nworkers will shoot up from around 6 million in 2019 to nearly 14 million, or 8.4%, in the second quarter of this year.\nWithout the expected stimulus, an additional 2 million to 3 million workers would likely lose their jobs, with the unemployment\nrate topping out above 10% in short order.\nAs Congress finalizes the third phase of stimulus, there has already been an unprecedented surge in initial unemployment\ninsurance filings of 3.6 million during the past two weeks. This surge amply demonstrates the pain being felt around the country.\nMoreover, the figure likely understates the actual number of layoffs because of likely delays in handling such an enormous number\nof claims at one time.\nAs part of the stimulus package passed by the Senate, laid-off workers will receive $600 each week in addition to their regular\nstate benefits through the end of July. This means that the extra benefits will be available for only four months and idled workers\nwho are receiving benefits now and will be out of work for four months will receive the extra income. However, workers laid off in\ntwo months, for example, will receive the extra amount for only two months.\nSizable boost to income\nThe $600 provides a sizable boost to income by more than doubling the average benefit for even the most generous state of\nMassachusetts, where average benefits in January amounted to $546. The average benefit across the country is only $385 a week.\nThe generosity of the additional $600 benefit was met with some opposition in the Senate, raising concerns about employers\nlaying off workers more readily knowing that benefits will more fully support them and concerns that workers will not look for new\njobs as quickly given the availability of such generous benefits.\nHowever, this concern should be weighed against the very low average payments, which nationally replace less than 40% of\naverage weekly wages for a full-time worker. Even in the most generous states, the replacement rate falls below half of weekly\nincome and in some states such as Alaska as low as one-quarter of income. Further, the benefit will be available only for a limited\nperiod and the possible disincentive will vanish quickly.\nThe legislation also tacks on 13 weeks of emergency benefits after the state’s regular benefits expire. This will be particularly\nhelpful for workers in states that have cut back benefit duration from the 26 weeks that have traditionally been available, such as\nNorth Carolina and Florida, which currently offer only 12 weeks of benefits. Most states, including those that have curtailed\nstandard benefit duration, will extend them during periods of high unemployment.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS WHAT THE STIMULUS CAN DO 2In contrast to the emergency assistance to workers during past recessions, the stimulus bill also provides unemployment insurance\nbenefits to idled self-employed, contract, nonprofit and part-time workers, workers who typically are not eligible for benefits. In\naddition, workers who had not been employed long enough to receive benefits would now qualify, as will workers who quit their\njob or were not able to get to work because of the COVID-19 restrictions. These workers would receive the $600 provided in the\nbill and half of the average regular state benefit amount.\nFinally, unemployed workers will likely be able to receive benefits immediately without having to wait the usual one week, since\nthe bill provides an incentive to states to waive the waiting period by fully covering the first week of benefits with federal dollars.\nAdditional extensions\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS WHAT THE STIMULUS CAN DO 3The door is left open for additional federally funded extensions to unemployment insurance benefits if the all-but-certain\nrecession were to last longer or deeper than expected. Currently, we expect the recession to last through the second quarter.\nHowever, as with all recessions, it will take some time for unemployment to recede, as many businesses will surely fail as a result\nof the measures being taken to contain COVID-19.\nAdditionally, rising uncertainty, battered consumer confidence, and the negative wealth effect from huge losses in the equity\nmarket will suppress consumer spending and lead to more business failures, lost income and layoffs. For example, in the wake of\nthe Great Recession, the number of firms in the U.S. shrank by about 330,000, or more than 6%.\nIn addition to the UI boost, workers will be aided directly by onetime payments of $1,200 to individuals earning less than $75,000,\nphasing out at $99,000, and $2,400 to married couples earning twice that, plus $500 per child. About 90% of Americans would\nbe eligible. Further, workers will get an indirect benefit from small-business loans being made available to companies in the hopes\nof preventing mass business closures. These loans will be forgiven if firms retain their workers instead of resorting to layoffs.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS WHAT THE STIMULUS CAN DO 4© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
