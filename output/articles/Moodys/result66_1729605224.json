Expectations are that lawmakers will suspend or increase the\nTreasury debt limit before this happens, allowing the Treasury to issue more debt and pay the bills.\nBut what if they do not?1\nEstimating the X-date\nThe Treasury debt limit, also known as the debt ceiling, is the maximum amount of debt that the Treasury\ncan issue to the public or to other federal agencies. The amount is set by law and has been increased or sus-\npended many times over the decades to allow the Treasury to finance the government’s operations.\nThe debt limit was hit on January 19, and the Treasury is now using “extraordinary measures” to come up\nwith the additional cash needed to pay its bills. Based on our assessment of the government’s outlays and\nreceipts in coming weeks, those measures seem likely to be exhausted by mid-August. To be more precise,\nthe X-date appears to be August 18.2 That is a few days after the Treasury will have made a scheduled inter-\nest payment to Treasury bondholders (see chart 1). Investors in short-term Treasury securities are coalesc-\ning around a similar X-date, demanding higher yields on securities that mature just after the date given\nworries that a debt limit breach may occur (see chart 2).\nUnless the debt limit is increased, suspended, or done away with by then, someone will not get paid in a\ntimely way. The U.S. government will default on its obligations. In this analysis, a default occurs when the\nTreasury fails to make good on any of its obligations in full or on time, regardless of whether it is to bond-\nholders, Social Security beneficiaries, defense contractors, or others.\nThe original intent of the debt limit was to force lawmakers to be fiscally disciplined—to raise taxes or\nrestrain government spending sufficiently to keep the government’s deficits in check and its debt load low\nand stable. It has failed at this. Instead, the debt limit has become highly disruptive to the fiscal process,\nresulting in unproductive political brinkmanship that has unnerved financial markets, businesses and house-\nholds (see chart 3).\nThe current battle over the debt limit looks to be even more vexed than in times past. Odds that\nlawmakers are unable to resolve their differences and avoid a breach of the debt limit appear mean-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 2Chart 1: X-Date Is August 18 Give or Take\nCash balance and available extraordinary measures, $ bil\n600\nIRS continues Quarterly estimated payments by most\nissuing tax refunds corporations and certain individuals\n400\nLarge interest\n“Tax day” Increase in intra-\npayment\nwindfall governmental debt\n200\nOnetime extraordinary\nmeasures available\n0\n-200\nQuarterly estimated payments by most\ncorporations and certain individuals\n-400\n3/1/23 3/26/23 4/20/23 5/15/23 6/9/23 7/4/23 7/29/23 8/23/23 9/17/23 10/12/23\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 1\nChart 2: Investors Also Expect a Mid-August X-Date\nY-axis=26-wk and 52-wk Treasury bill yields as of 3/2/2023, %; X-axis=maturity dates\n4.95\nTreasury Secretary Yellen says Treasury default\nprior to early Jun is unlikely\n4.85\n4.75\n4.65\n4.55\nAug 18 X-date\n4.45\n4.35\n3/9/23 4/9/23 5/10/23 6/10/23 7/11/23 8/11/23 9/11/23 10/12/23 11/12/23 12/13/23 1/13/24 2/13/24\nPrior to Aug 2023 Aug 2023 After Aug 2023\nSources: Bloomberg, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 2\ningfully greater than zero. The difficulty house republicans had electing Kevin Mccarthy as Speaker,\nand the terms Speaker Mccarthy acquiesced to—including having a battle over the debt limit with\nDemocrats—do not augur well for a reasonably graceful resolution to the current impasse. Getting any\nlegislation through the legislative process is tough under typical circumstances. Getting highly con-\ntentious debt limit legislation signed into law through this congress before a potential breach will be a\nheavy lift.\nAdding to concern is the growing number of lawmakers openly contemplating whether the Treasury could\nnavigate a breach of the debt limit by prioritizing payments to Treasury bondholders. They may be earnest\nto question whether a breach would lead to turmoil in financial markets and the economy along the lines\nshown in this analysis, but their nonchalance is badly misguided.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 3Chart 3: Debt Limit Battle Will Hit an Already Fragile Collective Psyche\nRelative popularity of Google searches for…\n100 105\n95\n80\n85\n60\n75\n40\n65\n20\n55\n0 45\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nDebt ceiling (L) Government shutdown (L) Recession (L) Consumer sentiment, 1966Q1=100 (R)\nSources: Google Trends, Univ. of Michigan, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 3\nAnother worry is that global investors are not more exercised regarding the political and procedural head-\nwinds in addressing the debt limit. Nonplussed investors believe they have seen this movie many times and\nknow how it ends: That after bitter political back and forth, lawmakers will find a way to come to terms\nbefore a breach. Thus, interest rates will not rise and stock prices will not fall as the X-date approaches,\nsending the wrong signal to lawmakers who take their cues from investors. With investors so sanguine\nabout how this drama will play out, policymakers may believe they have nothing to worry about and fail to\nresolve the debt limit in time. This would be an egregious error.\nJust how lawmakers will resolve the impasse over the debt limit is thus uncomfortably uncertain. There are\nmany possible scenarios, each with different macroeconomic implications. In the analysis that follows, we\nconsider five scenarios ranging from a clean debt limit increase with no changes to fiscal policy and thus\nwith no meaningful impact on the economy to a breach of the debt limit that drags on for weeks and is\ncataclysmic to financial markets and the economy. We use the Moody’s Analytics Global Macroeconomic\nModel to quantify the economic impacts.3\nClean Debt Limit Increase4\nIn this scenario, history is a good guide and after much political wrangling congress and the Biden admin-\nistration come to terms just in time. They pass legislation to increase the debt limit just before the X-date,\nand the Treasury is able to pay all of the government’s bills on time. The legislation does not include any\nmeaningful changes to fiscal policy and is thus a so-called clean debt limit increase. As in times past, law-\nmakers are ultimately motivated to action by the recognition of the severe economic and political costs of\nbreaching the debt limit.\nThis scenario is consistent with the long, arduous history of agreements on the debt limit, and it is fitting\ngiven the bipartisan nature of the financial obligations the debt would cover. Both republicans and Demo-\ncrats supported close to $3 trillion in deficit-financed fiscal aid provided to the economy through the pan-\ndemic under President Trump in 2020. And while only Democrats supported the almost $2 trillion deficit-fi-\nnanced American rescue Plan passed early in the Biden administration to help with the fallout from the\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 4pandemic, only republicans supported the nearly $2 trillion deficit-financed Tax cut and Jobs Act passed\nearly in the Trump administration that cut corporate and personal income taxes.\nMore specifically, in this scenario, we assume lawmakers temporarily suspend the debt limit just prior to\nthe August 18 X-date through fiscal 2023, which ends on September 30. They do this to line up the debt\nlimit decision with the federal government’s fiscal 2024 budget, which is also must-pass legislation for law-\nmakers to ensure the government is funded and avoids a shutdown. To make sure there is maximal political\npressure to get this all done by October 1 the legislation that suspends the limit requires the Treasury to\nhave the same cash balance at the end of fiscal 2023 as it had at the start of the suspension when the cash\nbalance was virtually exhausted.5\nIn this scenario, lawmakers go on to increase the debt limit just prior to the October 1 start of fiscal 2024.\nThey increase the limit enough to push the next debt limit battle into early 2025, thus ensuring that it will\nnot get caught up in the 2024 presidential election. We also assume that there are no other serious debt\nlimit crises over the 10-year budget horizon through fiscal 2033.\nGetting the debt limit legislation across the finish line will surely be messy and painful at times, causing\nheightened volatility in financial markets. But in this scenario, lawmakers ultimately get the job done before\nthere is economic damage. The most significant financial market reaction is higher Treasury-bill yields for\nsecurities maturing just after the X-date. Stock prices, credit spreads and market volatility will also be under\nsome pressure in the days leading up to an agreement. But at the end of the drama there is no meaningful\nmacroeconomic fallout (see Tables 1-4).\nConstitutional Crisis\nOdds are that lawmakers will come to terms in time, but what if they do not? In this scenario, we assume that\nlawmakers are unable to reach agreement, and with a debt limit breach imminent President Biden invokes Sec-\ntion 4 of the 14th Amendment and orders the Treasury to keep issuing bonds and paying the government’s bills.\nThe 14th Amendment states that the “validity of the public debt of the United States…shall not be questioned.”\nThis seems a tenuous constitutional interpretation for the president to use, but given no better option, he uses it.\nIndeed, a number of workarounds to a debt limit are being hotly debated. One of the most notable would\nhave the Treasury issue a $1 trillion platinum coin to raise the cash it needs. Federal law does provide the\nTreasury with the authority to mint platinum coins, and the thinking is that the Treasury would mint a $1\ntrillion coin, deposit it at the Federal reserve, and draw it down to pay the government’s bills. however, the\nlaw authorizing platinum coins envisaged commemorative coins, not circumventing congress’ power of the\npurse. This would also put the Federal reserve in the middle of the battle, badly politicizing the central bank\nand significantly jeopardizing its independence, which is critical to a well-functioning economy.\nAnother proposed workaround is to have the Treasury issue premium bonds rather than par bonds as Treasury\ndebt comes due, lowering the face amount of debt outstanding and subject to the debt limit.6 Of course, the\npresent value of the Treasury’s debt obligation has not changed, so this is just a budget gimmick, but so too is the\ndebt limit. While it shows creative financial engineering, this is not something the Treasury could roll out quickly,\nand it would be costly to commit the Treasury to making higher and higher interest payments. It also threatens\nthe well-functioning of the Treasury bond market, the world’s largest and most liquid market. Besides, interest\nrates would likely still spike as investors view this chicanery as putting the nation’s fiscal discipline at risk.7\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 5But if push comes to shove and lawmakers are about to breach the debt limit, a 14th Amendment decla-\nration by the president seems the most viable option. The president can reasonably argue that his action\npreserves the constitutional sanctity of the nation’s debt and abides by the government’s duty to pay all its\nbills on time. Arguing otherwise seems an uncomfortable political position to be in.\nOf course, Section 4 of the 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the civil War to ensure the federal\ngovernment was not on the hook for the war debt of the confederate states. Investors would rightly won-\nder if using the amendment to abrogate the debt limit law would stand up in the courts. A constitutional\ncrisis would ensue with the Supreme court taking up the matter. In this scenario, we assume that the court\nrules by the end of October, about as long as it took for the court to rule on Bush vs. Gore in the wake of the\ncontested 2000 presidential election, and determines that Biden’s move is constitutional. The debt limit\nlaw is effectively revoked. After the Supreme court’s ruling, lawmakers quickly come to terms to finance the\ngovernment through fiscal 2024.\nThe extraordinary uncertainty created by the constitutional crisis leads to a selloff in financial markets until\nthe Supreme court rules. GDP and jobs are briefly diminished during this period, but the economy avoids a\nrecession and quickly rebounds. Long term, Treasury yields are a few basis points lower as the debt limit is\nno longer a threat to the budget process and the nation’s finances.\nPayment Prioritization\nA more worrisome scenario is that the debt limit is breached, and the Treasury prioritizes who gets paid on\ntime and who does not. The department almost certainly would pay investors in Treasury securities first to\navoid defaulting on its debt obligations.\nWhile the Treasury may have the technical ability to pay bond investors before others, as those payments\nare handled by the Fedwire payment system, and a different computer system handles other government\nobligations, it is unclear whether the Treasury is legally able to do so. It would almost certainly be chal-\nlenged in the courts. Bond investors, unsure how this legal uncertainty would be resolved, would demand a\nmuch higher interest rate in compensation.\nMoreover, politically it seems a stretch to think that bond investors, who include many foreign investors,\nwould get their money ahead of American seniors, the military, or even the federal government’s electric\nbill.8 And then there is the question of how all the other bills would be prioritized. It is not possible for the\nTreasury to sort through the blizzard of payments due each day. More likely, as outlined in a report by the\nTreasury’s inspector general, the Treasury would delay all payments until it received enough cash to pay a\ngiven day’s bills.\nFinancial markets would be roiled. A TArP moment seems likely. This harkens to the dark day in autumn\n2008 when congress initially failed to pass the Troubled Asset relief Program bailout of the banking\nsystem, and the stock market and other financial markets cratered. A similar crisis, characterized by\nspiking interest rates and plunging equity prices, would be ignited. Short-term funding markets, which\nare essential to the flow of credit that helps finance the economy’s day-to-day activities, likely would\nfreeze up as well. It was a matter of days for congress to reverse itself and vote for TArP, which is about\nthe amount of time we assume is needed to convince this congress to reverse itself and vote for a debt\nlimit increase.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 6It is unimaginable that lawmakers would allow things to get to this point, but as the TArP experience high-\nlights, they have done the unimaginable before. Still, if that harrowing experience is a guide, lawmakers\nwould quickly reverse course and resolve the debt limit impasse to allow the Treasury to resume issuing\ndebt again and pay its bills.\nIt is unclear whether the credit rating agencies would downgrade Treasury debt in this scenario. According to\nMoody’s Investors Service, it would downgrade if the Treasury failed to make a bond payment. But, according\nto the rating agency, if the episode was short-lived and cured with full recovery, the ratings impact “would likely\nbe limited, with the sovereign rating likely remaining close to Aaa, consistent with the US’ very high capacity to\nrepay debt and supported by a number of key considerations including very strong economic and institutional\ncredit features.”9 however, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the nation’s debt in the 2011 debt limit battle for\nmuch less, citing the political dysfunction at the time. Since then, that dysfunction has only intensified.\nA downgrade of Treasury debt would set off a cascade of credit implications and downgrades on the debt\nof many other financial institutions, nonfinancial corporations, municipalities, infrastructure providers,\nstructured finance transactions, and other debt issuers. Those institutions that are clearly backstopped by\nthe U.S. government, institutions such Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal home Loan Banks, would\nsuffer the biggest changes to their ratings. The effects on other institutions’ ratings would vary depending\non their relationship with the U.S. government and offsetting financial strengths.\nDespite lawmakers’ quick reversal in this scenario and our assumption that the rating agencies do not\nengage in downgrades, significant damage will have already been done. The timing could not be worse for\nthe economy; even without the specter of a debt limit breach many cEOs and economists believe a reces-\nsion is dead ahead. With the Federal reserve ramping up interest rates in an effort to quell wage and price\npressures, avoiding a recession would be difficult even if nothing else went wrong. Most leading indicators\nof recession, including the prescient Treasury yield curve—the difference between long- and short-term\nTreasury yields—strongly point to recession beginning later this year at about the time lawmakers will be\ndoing battle over the limit (see chart 4).\nChart 4: Leading Indicators Sound the Recession Alarm\nDifference between 10-yr Treasury and federal funds rate, ppt\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2 Yield curve inversion leads recessions by 12-18 mo\n-3\n-4\n76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nSources: Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics PresentatFioenb Truitaler,y M20o2n3th 2022\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 7The already fragile economy suffers a mild recession beginning late this year in this scenario. real GDP\ndeclines by nearly 0.5 percentage point peak to trough, employment declines by close to 1 million jobs, and\nthe unemployment rate rises from 3.4% to a peak of almost 5% (see chart 5). Financial markets sell off but\nsettle as investors take solace in lawmakers’ decision to quickly reverse course. The long-term fallout on the\neconomy is marginal, although global investors continue to demand several basis points more in interest on\nTreasury debt to compensate for the meaningful risk that lawmakers may breach the debt limit again in the\nfuture. Even a few basis points more on trillions in Treasury debt adds up to a significant cost to taxpayers. If\nTreasury securities are no longer perceived as risk free by global investors, future generations of Americans\nwould pay a steep economic price.\nChart 5: Unemployment Under Different Debt Limit Scenarios\nUnemployment rate, %\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33\nClean Debt Limit Payment Prioritization Prolonged Breach Constitutional Crisis House Republican Plan\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics PresentatFioenb Truitaler,y M20o2n3th 2022 5\nHouse Republican Plan\nIn this scenario, lawmakers avoid a debt limit breach by agreeing to adopt the government budget cuts\nrecently proposed by house republicans. That is, the Biden administration and enough congressional Dem-\nocrats acquiesce to a large reduction in future budgeted government outlays to balance the government’s\nbudget at the end of the 10-year budget horizon. There are no tax increases to help achieve the balanced\nbudget goal.\nAccording to the committee for responsible Budget, under the cBO’s February 2023 10-year budget pro-\njections, fully balancing the federal budget in that period would require $16 trillion in total spending cuts.\nBy 2033, at the end of the budget horizon, spending would need to be slashed by more than a quarter—\neven more if there are any exemptions.\nhouse republicans have yet to precisely lay out how these spending cuts would be achieved, although\nthey have committed to leaving the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs intact. Given this\nconstraint, they could opt to largely eliminate all defense and nondefense discretionary spending programs.\nAnother option would be to cut Medicaid in half while eliminating all other mandatory spending outside of\nSocial Security and Medicare. But most likely, and what we assume in this scenario, is that nondefense dis-\ncretionary spending and the Medicaid program are eliminated.10\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 8Given the dramatic reduction in government spending in this scenario and the already fragile economy,\nthe economy suffers a recession in 2024, costing the economy 2.6 million jobs at the worst of the down-\nturn and pushing unemployment to a peak of near 6%. The economy’s long-term growth prospects are\nalso meaningfully diminished given the severe fiscal restraint. A decade from now real GDP is 2.7% lower\nthan in the clean debt limit increase scenario (equal to more than one year’s worth of typical GDP growth),\nthere are almost 1 million fewer jobs, and the full-employment unemployment rate is 0.2 percentage point\nhigher (see chart 6). Interest rates are lower in this scenario in part because of the weaker economy but\nalso because of much less government borrowing given the massive cuts in outlays.\nChart 6: Employment Under Different Debt Limit Scenarios\nNonfarm employment, mil\n164\n162\n160\n158\n156\n154\n152\n150\n148\n146\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33\nClean Debt Limit Payment Prioritization Prolonged Breach Constitutional Crisis House Republican Plan\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics PresentatFioenb Truitaler,y M20o2n3th 2022 6\nThis analysis does not consider the distributional impacts of this scenario, but it is fair to say that lower-in-\ncome households suffer substantially more financially, as they rely heavily on the government benefits lost\nin the budget cuts. They are also the principal casualties of the lost jobs and higher unemployment resulting\nfrom the weaker economy.\nProlonged Breach\nThis leads to the darkest scenario. In it, lawmakers breach the debt limit and trigger a TArP moment but\nthen fail to respond and immediately reverse course. Instead, the political impasse drags on for weeks—say\nto just before Thanksgiving with the Treasury prioritizing debt payments over other bills. We assume in\nthese circumstances that the credit rating agencies would downgrade Treasury debt, precipitating wide-\nspread downgrades throughout the financial system.\nThe blow to the economy would be cataclysmic. Immediately, the federal government would have no\noption but to slash its outlays, since outlays could be no greater than revenues the Treasury collects.\nAssuming an October 1 debt limit breach that dragged on through mid-November, the Treasury would have\nno choice but to eliminate a cash deficit of approximately $350 billion by slashing government spending. As\nthese cuts work through the economy, the hit to growth would be overwhelming.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 9Adding to the economic turmoil would be the damage to consumer, business and investor confidence.\nPolitical brinkmanship over the operations of the federal government has been frightening for Americans\nto watch. In both the 2011 and 2013 debt limit episodes, households were closely attuned to the political\nhardball being played in Washington, and consumer sentiment slumped. The brinkmanship is also unnerv-\ning for businesses that will curtail investment and hiring, and for financial institutions that will quickly turn\nmore cautious in extending credit to households and businesses.\nIt is difficult to envisage what steps policymakers could take to mitigate the economic carnage. With law-\nmakers at loggerheads over the debt limit, it is unlikely they would agree on any fiscal support for the econ-\nomy in response to the self-inflicted crisis, at least not quickly. The Federal reserve would immediately cut\nshort-term rates to near the zero lower bound and ramp up quantitative easing—Fed purchases of Treasury\nbonds—but any benefit would be undermined as global investors sold or stopped buying U.S. securities.11\nThe economic downturn that would ensue would be comparable to that suffered during the global financial\ncrisis. That means real GDP would decline beginning late this year and through much of 2024, falling more\nthan 4% peak to trough, costing the economy more than 7 million jobs, and pushing the unemployment\nrate above 8%. Stock prices would fall by almost a fifth at the worst of the selloff, wiping out $10 trillion\nin household wealth. Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and other consumer and corporate borrowing rates\nwould initially spike, until the debt limit is resolved, decline during the subsequent deep recession, but ulti-\nmately remain elevated as investors demand compensation for the risk of a future breach (see chart 7). The\neconomy’s long-term growth prospects are also weakened. A decade from now, real GDP is almost 1 per-\ncentage point lower than in the clean Debt Limit Increase scenario, there are 900,000 fewer jobs, and the\nfull-employment, or structural, unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point higher.\nChart 7: 10-Year Treasury Yield Under Different Debt Limit Scenarios\n10-yr Treasury yield, %\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33\nClean Debt Limit Payment Prioritization Prolonged Breach Constitutional Crisis House Republican Plan\nSources: Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics PresentatFioenb Truitaler,y M20o2n3th 2022 7\nThe broad trade-weighted value of the U.S. dollar would decline only modestly in this scenario, at least in\nthe near term, as global investors would be unsure of alternative global safe havens to the dollar. The Swiss\nfranc, euro and British pound would be the most significant beneficiaries. however, the value of the U.S.\ndollar steadily weakens in the longer run, since its status as the global reserve currency is diminished.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 10Conclusions\nThat the U.S. government is “money good”—that it pays the government’s bills on time—is a bedrock of\nthe U.S. economy and global financial system. Alexander hamilton, the nation’s first Treasury secretary,\nestablished this principle at the founding of the nation when he agreed to pay revolutionary War bond\ninvestors at 100 cents on the dollar, even though the bonds were trading at pennies on the dollar because\nfew believed the new American government would make good on its debts.\nWhen the government did make good, it established the sound credit of the U.S., ensuring that we are the\nglobal safe haven. hamilton’s action said that when times are tough, even here at home, capital still flows,\nkeeping interest rates down and ultimately paving the way for the U.S. dollar to become the global econo-\nmy’s reserve currency. The economic benefits over the generations are incalculable. Lawmakers must put a\nquick end to their wrangling over the debt limit so future generations can enjoy the same benefits.\nPolitical brinkmanship over the debt limit is thus painful to watch. If lawmakers are unable to increase or\nsuspend the debt limit before the Treasury fails to make a payment later this summer, the resulting chaos in\nglobal financial markets will be overwhelming. The U.S. and global economies, which are already struggling\nwith high inflation and rising interest rates, would suffer a severe economic downturn.

Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 17Endnotes\n1 The Moody’s Analytics white paper “Debt Limit Brinkmanship (Again)” provides additional relevant analysis on the Treasury debt limit.\n2 This is consistent with the X-date ranges from the Bipartisan Policy center and the congressional Budget Office.\n3 The Moody’s Analytics macroeconomic model of the U.S. and global economies is similar in theory and empirics to those used by the Federal\nreserve Board and congressional Budget Office for forecasting, budgeting and policy analysis.\n4 The Moody’s Analytics baseline, or most likely, outlook is similar to this scenario except that to pass legislation increasing the debt limit and the\nfiscal 2024 budget we expect there will be a token compromise between Democrats and republicans. At least some house republican votes will\nbe needed, and the quid pro quo to get these votes is assumed to be some mutually agreeable tweaks to the budget rules, and a small reduction\nin future budgeted non-defense discretionary government outlays, excluding funds for the Veterans Administration.\n5 The assumption that lawmakers temporarily suspend the debt limit to line it up with the start of fiscal 2024 is common to all of the scenarios\nwe consider in this analysis. Not only is the Treasury required to slash its cash balance to practically zero by September 30 when the suspension\nends, but the legislation temporarily suspending the debt limit through fiscal 2023 comes with other strings attached that prevent the Treasury\nfrom targeting the G Fund of Federal Employees’ retirement System Thrift Savings Plan, which normally provides the Treasury significant head-\nroom under the debt limit. As a result, October 1 is the effective X-date once the suspension ends. This is similarly true in all the scenarios we put\nforth in this analysis.\n6 A simple example illustrates. The seven-year Treasury bond is trading at 3.5% and there is an upcoming auction for these securities of $35 bil-\nlion. Suppose the Treasury instead offers $35 billion face value of seven-year bonds at 5%. The bond market should price them at around 109%\nof par. This would bring in $38 billion in proceeds, which would retire $38 billion in Treasury debt, but increase the debt subject to the limit by\nonly $35 billion for a net reduction in debt subject to the limit of $3 billion. This could be scaled up by issuing even higher coupons, for example\nthe Treasury might bring in $14 billion with $35 billion of face value and a 10% coupon.\n7 There are likely many unintended consequences as well given how engrained Treasury bonds are in a wide variety of contracts. The tax conse-\nquences of large premiums are also unknown and could be complicated.\n8 There have been legislative attempts to prioritize the Treasury’s payments in the case of breach of the default limit. Social Security payments,\npayments to the military, and interest and principal payments to Treasury bond investors receive priority. But the legislation has never become\nlaw and would likely not mitigate a serious reaction by global investors, who would appropriately conclude that this prioritization would be po-\nlitically untenable and not stand for long.\n9 Additional documentation from Moody’s Investors Service is available upon request. The rating agency plans to release an updated FAQ on the\ndebt limit later in March.\n10 This may overstate house republicans’ budget-cutting ambitions. If, for example, their goal is to balance the primary budget by 2033 or to im-\nplement cuts sufficient to stabilize the federal debt-to-GDP ratio near its current level of just less than 100%, the budget cuts needed would be\nclose to half of those assumed in this scenario to balance the full budget.\n11 Federal reserve policy in the scenarios is determined endogenously with the Moody’s Analytics macroeconomic model. The federal funds rate\nequation in the model is a reaction function, which accounts for the Fed’s dual mandate of low and stable inflation and full employment. It also\ncaptures financial conditions, which impact the transmission of Fed policy to the economy, and global economic conditions.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS GoinG Down the Debt Limit Rabbit hoLe 18About the Authors\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
