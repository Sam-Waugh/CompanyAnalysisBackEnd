To assess the complete picture, we must also consider the changes taking place with the implementation of IFRS 9 which\ncovers the measurement of financial instruments. To evaluate the effect of the new accounting standards on P&L, insurers must be\naware of the potential for accounting mismatches if the classification choices under IFRS 9 are inconsistent with the treatment and\nclassification under IFRS 17.\nIFRS 9\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaced IAS 39 effective 1 January 2018. However, there was an option for insurers to defer\nimplementation of IFRS 9 to align with the introduction of IFRS 17. Most insurers have chosen this option and thus deferred\nimplementation of IFRS 9 to coincide with the IFRS 17 start date.\nUnder IFRS 9, there are three categories for asset classification:\nCategory Description\nFVPL Assets are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and all gains and losses are recognized in\nFair value through profit and loss profit and loss (P&L) as they arise.\nAmortized Cost Assets are measured on an amortized basis. P&L is driven by the interest income, which is based\non the book value of the asset (effective interest method).\nFVOCI Assets are held on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are initially recognized\nFair value through other in other comprehensive income (OCI). Upon sale of an FVOCI asset, the change in fair value\ncomprehensive income previously recognized in OCI is recycled to P&L.\nFigure 1 illustrates the classification model for assets under IFRS 9. Insurers must consider the “solely payments of principal and\ninterest” (SPPI) test which, along with the business test, determines the classification.\nFigure 1: The classification model for assets under IFRS 9\nSolely principal and interest\nHold to collect\nHold to collect Other\n& to sell\nBusiness model is to Business model is to both\ncollect the cash flows collect the cash and to sell\nAmortized cost FVOCI FVPL\nOR\nFVPL\nOption to designate to FVPL, only if it significantly reduces\naccounting mismatch\nIf an asset meets the SPPI test, there are two possible measurement models depending on the business model:\n» Held to collect: If the asset portfolio is held to collect contractual cash flows, then measurement is at amortized cost. This applies\nwhere the selling of assets is incidental to the business model objective.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 03» Held to collect and to sell: If the portfolio is held both for collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, then\nmeasurement is at FVOCI. For example, this applies where an insurer collects bond cash flows to meet insurance liabilities.\nHowever, to ensure that cash flows are sufficient to settle the liabilities, the insurer also regularly rebalances the portfolio and\ntherefore undertakes regular buying and selling of the bonds.\nCrucially, there is also an option to designate at FVPL. Insurers can choose to classify financial assets at FVPL if, by doing so, they\neliminate or significantly reduce the accounting mismatch, more formally referred to as a measurement or recognition inconsistency.\nThis mismatch arises when gains and losses from assets and liabilities are recognized on different bases, which could be the case upon\ntransition to IFRS 17. In this paper, we consider the case where the insurer has applied the option to designate at FVPL and therefore\nthe assets are reported at FVPL.\nCase study\nTo illustrate the interaction between IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, we consider an IFRS 17 contract group consisting of immediate annuities. The\ngeneral measurement model is applied and the analysis considers the impact of different liability discount rates on the projected P&L.\nIn terms of classification approach, we consider the case where the insurer elects the same accounting option for assets and liabilities,\nwhich is to book both at fair value through P&L. The impact of interest rate changes on the value of the insurance contracts are\nrecognized at FVPL and the asset movements are also classified at FVPL. Assuming asset and liability cash flows are well matched,\nit is reasonable to assume that this option lowers the P&L volatility, relative to reporting the asset at amortized cost. There is also\nthe option to classify the assets at FVOCI, which might be another feasible choice for insurers, subject to the business model test\noutcome.\nIn this paper, we use an agile1 valuation model to project the financial statements, in particular the P&L, and to analyze the effect\nof different scenarios. This enables the impact of decisions such as discount rate methodology to be assessed. The case study uses\nstochastic models. The projected asset returns and liability discount factors are generated using an Economic Scenario Generator. The\nassets are assumed to be invested in corporate bonds, which are cash flow matched to the expected liability outgo, with an additional\nholding in cash. The liability discount curve is based on a risk-free yield curve with an adjustment for an illiquidity premium, and this\npaper illustrates sensitivities to the size of the illiquidity premium. The demographic risks are also modeled stochastically with the\nannuitant mortality rates generated using a stochastic mortality model.\nP&L reporting under IFRS 17\nUnder IFRS 17, the profit and loss disclosure attempts to differentiate between the source of profit or loss arising from providing the\ninsurance coverage and that arising from investment income. The P&L must be separated into the insurance service result and the net\nfinancial result.\nInsurance service result\n» The Insurance Service Result includes the release of the risk adjustment and release of the contractual service margin (CSM). The\nCSM is released over time in proportion to the chosen coverage units.\n» Changes in the mortality assumptions have an effect on the insurance service result. The impact of longevity improvements can\nbe absorbed, up to a point, by the initial CSM. In the scenario where the CSM is wiped out completely, subsequent changes in\nmortality expectations result in immediate P&L.\nNet financial result\n» The net financial result is composed of the investment income and the insurance finance expenses. The former represents the\ninvestment income from the assets. Insurance finance expenses incorporates the effect of changes in the discount rate on the\nfulfillment cash flows, and the impact of the unwind of the liability discount rate.\n» Interest accreted on the CSM is included in the net financial result.\n1 Further details of the modeling approach are given in Profit emergence under IFRS17: Gaining business insight through projection models, Steven Morrison (August 2018).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 04Impact of choice of liability discount rate on expected profit emergence\nIn this case study, we have a portfolio of annuity policies. The Figure 2: Comparison of projected P&L for different liability\nassets backing the annuity outgo are modeled as a diversified discount rates\nportfolio of A-rated corporate bonds, constructed to provide Figure 2a\na cash flow match to the annuity outgo. The assets backing\nthe risk adjustment and the surplus assets are assumed to be\ninvested in cash. In accordance with IFRS 17 standards, the\nliability discount rate includes an illiquidity premium. In this\nexample, the liquidity premium2 is evaluated as 50% * {spread\non the corporate bond portfolio – 40 bp}.\nWe consider the scenario where there are no changes to\nassumptions and the yield curves (both risk-free and credit\nspreads) evolve as per the initial curve, and there are no defaults\nor transitions experienced on the bond portfolio. The projected\nP&L is shown in figure 2b, split in to the insurance service result\nand the net financial result. To illustrate the impact on expected\nprofit emergence of including an illiquidity premium in the\nliability valuation, we compare against the two “boundary” Figure 2b\ncases: the case where the liability discount curve is the risk-free\ndiscount curve (that is, no liquidity premium, see figure 2a), and\nthe case where the liability discount curve includes the full yield\non the assets (see figure 2c). The latter is extreme but serves as\na useful comparison point for our analysis. In this scenario, we\nproject the P&L for 10 years and compare the results.\nThese charts illustrate how the choice of liability discount rate\ninfluences the profile of projected P&L. Opting for a more\naggressive discount rate on day 1 (that is, higher illiquidity\npremium) will result in a higher CSM, which leads to higher\nprojected insurance service results as this higher CSM is\nreleased. However, projected net financial results are lower,\nas liabilities unwind at a higher rate. In the extreme example\nwhere the liability discount rate is the same as the asset\nFigure 2c\nyield, the investment income on assets offsets almost exactly\nagainst the finance expense on liabilities and the reported net\nfinancial result is close to zero for the next five years (the only\ncontribution being interest earned on the surplus cash and\ninterest accreted on the CSM).\nOver the lifetime of the business, the total P&L will be the same\nunder all examples. It is the timing of recognition of the P&L—\nand the allocation between insurance service result and net\nfinancial result—that is influenced by the decision regarding the\nchoice of discount rate.\nInsurance service result\nNet financial result\n2 This formula was originally developed by the CFO forum for MCEV reporting.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 05Impact of choice of liability discount rate on earnings volatility\nRather than look at a single scenario, the agile model provides Figure 3: Comparison of the net financial result\nthe ability to investigate many scenarios. Generating scenarios Figure 3a\nusing a stochastic model, we can build a picture of the\ndistribution of items on the financial statements, or metrics\nderived from these scenarios. Figure 3 shows the results from a\nrandom sample of scenarios from the stochastic modeling.\nVolatility of the net financial result decreases as more of the\ncredit spread on assets is included in the liability discount\nrate, and the net financial result is more immune to spread\nmovements. For example, in our extreme case where the\nilliquidity premium is set at the asset yield, the investment\nincome and insurance finance expense almost exactly offset,\nsince both are driven by the A-rated credit curve—and recall\nthat the asset portfolio is cash flow matched to the liability\ncash flows. Note that even in this extreme case there is some\nvolatility primarily due to rating migrations on the asset\nFigure 3b\nportfolio.\nFigure 3c\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 06Similarly, the stochastic model can be used to assess the Figure 4: Comparison of the insurance service result\nvolatility of the insurance service result, as shown in Figure Figure 4a\n4. This shows the results from the same sample of scenarios\nfrom the stochastic modeling. As described earlier the liability\ndiscount rate affects the CSM, and therefore the probability of a\ncontract group becoming onerous, and so affects the volatility\nof the insurance service result. The impact of introducing an\nilliquidity premium is an increase in the initial CSM, which\nmeans there is less chance of the CSM being wiped out and thus\nany mortality assumption change has a lower impact on the\ninsurance service result.\nFigure 4b\nFigure 4c\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 07Summary\nThe principles-based nature of IFRS 17 means that significant judgement will be involved in implementing the standard. The\nmethodology used to define the liability discount rate is one of the key decisions that companies must make, and there have been\nseveral articles on this topic.3 The current focus is on IFRS 17 and interpreting the principles but insurers must not forget about IFRS 9,\nwhich is also a complex standard. It is important to understand how the two standards interact, the resulting earnings volatility, and\nthe sensitivity of volatility to methodology choices available under both standards (in particular the OCI option under IFRS 17 and\noption to classify as FVPL under IFRS 9). The use of projection models and stochastic modeling can be a useful tool in assessing the\nimpact of these decisions.\nThis paper considered the case of a well-matched annuity portfolio where the insurer elected to report movements in both assets and\nliabilities at FVPL. By selecting the same accounting treatment on both sides of the balance sheet, this helps reduce P&L volatility,\nwith the degree of volatility dependent on the size of the illiquidity premium included in the liability discount rate. Furthermore, the\npaper illustrates how the choice of liability discount rate influences the allocation of P&L between the insurance service result and the\nnet financial result.\n3 Refer to Permitted approaches for constructing IFRS 17 Discount Rates, Nick Jessop.\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2018/permitted-approaches-for-constructing-ifrs17-discount-rates.pdf\nThe top-down approach is covered in more detail in A cost of capital approach to estimating credit risk premia, Alasdair Thompson and Nick Jessop.\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2018/a-cost-of-capital-approach-to-estimating-credit-risk-premium.pdf\nCONTACT DETAILS\nVisit us at moodysanalytics.com or contact us at a location below.\nAMERICAS EMEA ASIA (EXCLUDING JAPAN) JAPAN\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com clientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\n© 2019 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
