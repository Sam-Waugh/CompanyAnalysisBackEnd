The fastest growth\nwas reported by Shawbrook which was partly due to acquisitions of smaller lenders over\nthis period. On the other hand, TSB and Virgin Money showed stagnation in overall asset\nsize due to contraction in their mortgage portfolios since 2020.\nHowever, the growth rates of customer loans indicates even slower growth for this peer group.\nStarling Bank was leading the peers on this metric, albeit from a very low base (total loan book\nwas GBP 54.2mn in 2019). The majority of the UK challenger banks grew their loans books at\nsingle digit CAGRs since 2020. This indicates constrained lending opportunities for organic\ngrowth as well as general market stagnation due to higher interest rate environment since 2023.\nThe pressure from the significantly higher interest rates is also evidenced by the high-street\nbanks’ stagnation in loan growth with the average CAGR close to zero since 2020.\nFIGURE 1 Total Assets and Gross Loans to Customers CAGR, YE 2020 to YE 2023*\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 4BankFocus\nRWA INTENSITY IS ON AVERAGE HIGHER COMPARED TO THE HIGH-\nSTREET BANKS\nThe UK challenger banks reported a wide range of RWA Intensity ratios from 14% to 51% as at\nend-2023. This compares less favorably with the high-street average ratio at 26% as at end-2023.\nOneSavings and Virgin Money had their RWA intensity indicators aligned with the high-street\nbanks’ average. However, the rest of the UK challenger banks had notably higher RWA intensity\nratios exceeding 40% as at end-2023.\nShawbrook had the highest RWA intensity among the group above 50%, due to its sizeable\nholdings of higher-risk weighted buy-to-let mortgage loans. In contrast, Starling Bank had the\nlowest, but increasing, RWA intensity below 15% due to a large portion of its assets in low-risk\nliquid instruments (c. liquid assets were 45% of total assets as at end-2023).\nFIGURE 2 RWA Intensity (%), YE 2020 to 1HYE 2023\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 5BankFocus\nSTARLING BANK AND SHAWBROOK HAVE BETTER PROFITABILITY\nINDICATORS\nThe profitability ratios of the UK challenger banks varied during the last year, with four of them\nabove the high-street peer average. Shawbrook and Starling Bank had the best profitability\nindicators, supported by superior net interest margins at around 4.5%. Aldermore and Paragon\nwere also above the high-street banks’ profitability average and comparable to each other.\nTSB and Virgin Money had the weakest profitability indicators compared to the peers as well\nrelative to the high-street banks’ average. This was due to lower interest margins of their lending\nportfolios.\nAll challenger banks were highly dependent on Net Interest Income as their fees and\ncommissions represented only small part of Operating Revenues (Appendix II). This indicates\nlower revenue diversification and sensitivity to the interest rate environment compared to the\nhigh-street banks.\nFIGURE 3\n.\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 6BankFocus\nHOWEVER, LOWER PROFITABILITY IS MITIGATED BY BETTER ASSETS\nQUALITY\nThere was notable difference in asset quality metrics among the challenger banks peer group.\nThe lower profitability of TSB and Virgin Money reflects their risk-averse lending strategies and\nresulted in better non-performing loan ratios. On average, however, the challenger banks had less\nfavourable asset quality ratios compared to the high-street banks’ average.\nShawbrook, one of the most profitable challenger banks, had the weakest asset quality metrics\nwhich also was also indicated by its higher RWA intensity as noted above.\nLoan loss coverage ratios of the majority of challenger banks were below the high-street banks’\naverage at 45%. This relatively modest coverage ratios reflected dominance of secured lending\nand reliance on mortgage collateral. Aldermore had the highest loan loss coverage ratio\nexceeding 80% which mitigated its relatively higher non-performing asset ratio at 2.5%.\nOneSavings had a similar non-performing loan ratio with considerably lower provisioning\ncoverage as at end-2023.\nFIGURE 4\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 7BankFocus\nUNADJUSTED LEVERAGE RATIOS AND REGULATORY CET1 PAINT\nCONTRASTING PICTURES\nThe UK challenger banks’ CET1 ratios were in line with the high-street banks’ average ratio at 14%\n(excluding Nationwide). Starling Bank had the highest regulatory ratio which was due to low\nRWA intensity and higher proportion of liquid assets in its balance sheet.\nHowever, despite similar regulatory capital ratios, the unadjusted non-regulatory leverage ratios\nwere across a wider range for the challenger banks. TSB and Virgin Money had the lowest\nleverage ratios, with Aldermore leading the peers, despite its moderate regulatory CET1 ratio.\nStarling Bank had a more modest leverage ratio at 5.1% despite its very high regulatory CET1\nratio.\nFIGURE 5\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 8BankFocus\nLOW REFINANCING RISK AS WHOLESALE FUNDING DEPENDENCE IS\nMODERATE\nThe liquidity position of the challenger banks reflected different strategies of managing their\nrefinancing risk. While Shawbrook and Starling Bank and banks kept larger proportion of their\nassets in liquid instruments, OneSavings and TSB had the same ratio below 15% of total assets.\nHowever, most challenger banks compared unfavorably to the high-street banks’ average liquid\nasset ratio of at 24% .\nDependence on wholesale funding was more uniform among the challenger banks, ranging from\n17% to 22% of total liabilities (excluding Shawbrook). The latter was an outlier with the least\ndependence on wholesale funding at 15% of wholesale liabilities as at end-2023. Their wholesale\nfunding dependence on average was higher than the high-street banks’ average ratio at 18%.\nHowever, we expect that the nature of the challenger banks’ wholesale liabilities to be skewed\ntowards longer-term secured funding, thus reducing short-term refinancing risk.\nFIGURE\nOverall, these liquidity and funding ratios suggest a manageable short-term refinancing risk\namong the challenger banks, which is also evidenced by high Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR).\nExcept Virgin Money, all challenger banks had LCR ratios above the high-street banks’ average\nas at end-2023.\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 9BankFocus\nFIGURE 7\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 10BankFocus\nAPPENDIX\nAppendix I: Total Assets, YE 2021 to YE 2023.\nAppendix II: Net Interest Income / Operating Revenue, YE 2020 to YE 2023\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 11BankFocus\nAppendix III: ROAE and Recurring Earning Power, YE 2023\nAppendix IV: Cost to Income (Efficiency) Ratio, YE 2020 to YE 2023\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 12BankFocus\nAppendix V: Average CET1 Capital Generation (Net Income - Dividends / Total Equity),\nYE 2020 to YE 2023\nResearch methodology and scope\nUsing BankFocus search steps we analyzed the following financial factors: Asset Quality,\nProfitability, Capitalization, Liquidity and Funding for the period of financial end-2020 to end-\n2023.\nPrincipal Ratio definitions\nFor more detailed definitions refer to BankFocus Global detailed format – data and ratio\ndefinitions in the Help section of Popular guides, Financial data.\nWe analysed the following UK banks:\nChallenger banks: TSB BANK PLC, ONESAVINGS BANK PLC, ALDERMORE GROUP PLC,\nPARAGON BANKING GROUP PLC, VIRGIN MONEY UK PLC, SHAWBROOK GROUP PLC\nHigh Street Banks: LLOYDS BANK PLC, NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK PLC – NATWEST,\nHSBC UK BANK PLC, BARCLAYS BANK UK PLC, NATIONWIDE BUILDING SOCIETY,\nSANTANDER UK PLC\nUK Challenger Banks: Uneven Performance in a Sluggish Market. 13BankFocus\n© 2024 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
