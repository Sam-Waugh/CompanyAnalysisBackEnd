Overview\nNorth American corporates experienced a very steep credit quality decline during the first half of 2020 following the global\noutbreak of COVID-19. By the end of August 2020, the median EDF value of North American corporate firms was 1.67%, close to\ndouble the level at the same time last year. However, the current August level is noticeably lower compared to the 2.31%\nobserved at the end of March 2020, which marked the first time the median EDF value has doubled year-over-year since\nSeptember 2008. The decline is attributed to the equity market recovery, while balancing out the fact that volatility remains\nheightened. The median EDF credit measure increased by 59% year-to-date.\nWe also observe a similar magnitude of declining risk in the credit markets following the high in March 2020, with both bond\nspreads and CDS spreads retracting from recent five-year highs. Yet again, the gap between the spreads from high-yield and\ninvestment grade remains large compared to recent history.\nObserved corporate defaults of non-financial public firms still remain low compared with historical standards, but they are higher\nthan what we saw during the previous years. The onset of the coronavirus outbreak was sudden and still relatively recent. It will\ntake time for impacts to trickle down and become default events. However, we have started to see a handful of COVID-19–related\ndefaults in the United States.\nEDF levels for a number of risky industry sectors increased significantly during the last 12 months. Specifically, oil- and consumer-\nrelated industries made up the top of the list when ranking industries by liability-weighted EDF measures. These sectors were also\namong the industries that experienced the largest increases in risk during the prior year.\nThis report first shows overall credit trends, reflected through realized default counts, the EDF credit measure and its drivers, and\ncredit spreads for North American non-financial firms. Subsequently, we analyze the riskiest industry sectors using a variety of\nmetrics. We also report credit migration patterns using EDF metrics.\nDuring the last financial crisis, we published periodic EDF reports that many clients found helpful. This report follows our previous\nreports1 for North American and European corporates regarding COVID-19’s impact on EDF credit risk measures. These reports are\navailable at www.moodysanalytics.com.\n1 https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2020/edf-report-march-2020-for-north-american-corporate-firms\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2020/edf-report-may-2020-for-north-american-corporate-firms\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2020/edf-report-june-2020-for-north-american-corporate-firms\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2020/edf-report-july-2020-for-north-american-corporate-firms\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n32. Credit measure trends\nThis section shows EDF credit measure movements and key drivers for North American non-financial companies between January\n2000 and August 2020. We report these trends in conjunction with realized default counts and credit spreads.\n2.1 Realized defaults\nFigure 1 shows quarterly default counts for North American public corporates, classified by whether the firm is rated at the time of\ndefault. Figure 2 presents the quarterly number of defaults, highlighting bankruptcy defaults. Default occurrences reaffirm that the\nmost recent benign credit environment continued at least until the end of 2019. So far, we have seen only a handful of defaults in\nthe sample during the first half of 2020. However, given that the onset of the pandemic has been sudden, and it is still relatively\nrecent, we might still see a significant increase in defaults during the second half of 2020 if the credit environment continues to\ndeteriorate. Figures 1 and 2 detail default counts by rating status and default type, respectively. Figure 3 reports monthly default\ncounts occurring the previous year, during which period the default counts remained low. The 12-month default count rolling\naverage currently stands at 7.58, up from 5.08 one year ago. As a benchmark, during the past 10 years, the average monthly\ndefault count is around 11.38.\nQuarterly default counts by rating status\nQuarterly default counts by default type\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n4Monthly default counts during the past year\n2.2 EDF Credit measures and drivers\nFigure 4 reports quartiles of the EDF credit measure and its drivers, including underlying asset volatility and market leverage, from\nJanuary 2000 through August 2020. Recently, we have seen a substantial rise in EDF values as a result of significant market\nleverage increases. During the past 12 months, the median EDF value rose over 50%, from 1.12% to 1.67%. Median leverage\ndecreased from 24.68% to 24.07% potentially due to the recent equity market recovery. Median asset volatility increased from\n37.37% to 42.14%.\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n5Trends of one-year EDF credit measures and drivers\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n62.3 EDF Credit measures and drivers: rated firms\nFigure 5 presents EDF measures and drivers for firms holding an agency rating assignment by Moody’s Investors Service. To ensure\neach rating group has a sufficiently large number of firms, we analyze only groups rated A through B. In the cross-section, the\nmedian EDF values for these rating groups are consistent with the risk order indicated by agency ratings. For EDF value drivers, B-\nrated firms are riskiest in terms of both business risk (that is, asset volatility) and financial risk (that is, leverage). The EDF value\ndifference between Baa-rated and Ba-rated firms is primarily driven by asset volatilities, while leverage is the main driver for the EDF\nvalue difference between Baa-rated and A-rated firms.\nCurrently, Ba and B-rated firm EDF credit measures are still at levels close to the historical highs seen during 2008−2009. These\nlevels show a stark contrast with the much more benign credit environment observed during the past few years. For example, a Ba-\nrated firm is now almost as risky as a B-rated firm in early 2019. However, despite the recent volatility, the EDF credit measures for\ninvestment-grade firms still remain relatively moderate.\nWe observed a moderate increase in median asset volatilities across all rating groups, up from historic lows at the second half of\n2019. The bottom panel of Figure 5 shows that the market leverage—the ratio of the default point over the market value of\nassets—presented a sharp increase from their historic lows and a recent pullback. The magnitude of the increase in leverage from\nthe first half of 2020 is almost as steep as the one observed during October and November 2008. The recent pullback in market\nleverage reflected partial recovery of market capitalization for North American corporates across all rating groups. Yet such a\nheightened level in market leverage still points to the much-deteriorated debt service capacity of North American corporates\nduring recent months.\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n7Trends of one-year EDF credit measures and drivers: rated firms\n2.4 Credit spreads\nFigure 6 presents the time series of median values for the EDF credit measure, the five-year CDS spread, and the option-adjusted\nspread (OAS) of investment-grade and high-yield North American public firms from January 2014 to August 2020. Median bond\noption-adjusted spreads are derived from the sample of bonds in coverage by the Moody’s Analytics EDF-based bond valuation\nmodel. Generally, all three measures have been moving in tandem during the longer history. The recent dramatic change is readily\napparent for all three measures, especially for the high-yield space. Figure 7 shows the median credit metrics by broad rating group\nas of the end of August 2020 and one year ago. As oil and gas-related firms account for a large portion of high-yield bonds, we see\nthe high-yield space was essentially hit concurrently by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent oil price shock, causing\nsignificant distress to speculative-grade debt.\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n8Similar to the pattern observed for EDF credit measures, both OAS and five-year CDS spreads present a substantially steeper credit\nrisk increase in the high-yield space than in the investment-grade space, suggested by the widened gap between the two broad\nrating classes, shown as the dashed blue line in Figure 6.\nMedians of credit measures: investment grade vs. high yield\nFigure 7 Median credit measures as of August 30, 2019 and August 31, 2020\n2019-08-30 2020-08-31\nRating EDF 5yr CDS OAS Rating EDF 5yr CDS OAS\nAa 0.01% 0.34% 0.73% Aa 0.01% 0.34% 0.75%\nA 0.02% 0.43% 1.05% A 0.03% 0.44% 1.09%\nBaa 0.03% 0.71% 1.61% Baa 0.05% 0.68% 1.74%\nBa 0.10% 1.36% 2.51% Ba 0.41% 1.63% 3.26%\nB 1.37% 2.56% 3.61% B 2.22% 3.07% 4.83%\n<B 28.93% 23.67% 15.31% <B 4.79% 7.74% 8.45%\nAs the current elevated level of credit spreads potentially reflects both the anticipated increase in default risk and investors’ increased\nrisk aversion, we analyze market Sharpe ratios, estimated using a Moody’s Analytics EDF-based bond valuation model shown in\nFigure 8. It is apparent that the estimated market price of credit risk has fallen back dramatically from the height during March\n2020.\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n9Figure 8 Market prices of credit risk estimated from bond option-adjusted spreads and EDF value data\n3. Industry analysis\nThis section applies two measures that capture different aspects of industry risk. The first measure is based on the average EDF value\nweighted by total liabilities of each company in a given industry. Therefore, this measure is dominated by the risks of firms with large\nliability amounts. The second measure is the percentage of firms with EDF values greater than the 90th percentile of the entire\npopulation of North American non-financial companies. Consequently, this measure tends to be more represented by the risks of\nsmaller companies, which are more likely riskier in most industries. With both measures, the analysis in this section helps paint a\nrelatively complete picture of industry-level credit risk for North American corporates. To avoid small sample bias, we examine only\nindustries with more than 20 firms as of August 31, 2020.\n3.1 Riskiest industries\nThe entire North American corporate population has a 1.76% liability-weighted EDF credit measure, up from 1.44% last year. Figure\n9 shows the riskiest industries and the distribution of liability-weighted EDF credit measures across all industries. The chart on the\nleft side displays the top-10 riskiest industries and their EDF measures; the chart on the right side displays the EDF measure\ndistribution of all industries.\nThe riskiest industries are Oil & Gas Refining and Mining, probably not surprisingly. This industry was hit twice in rapid\nsuccession—decreased demand due to the coronavirus pandemic and a massive equity price drop due to the fall in oil prices. In\nparticular, the liability-weighted EDF value for the Oil, Gas & Coal Exploration/Production industry is 7.9%, presenting alarming\nlevels of default risk. Other industries topping the list tend to be non-essentials, including Consumer Services, as well as Consumer\nProducts Retailers and Wholesalers. Compared to last month, all of the 10 most risky industries experienced a decline in the\nliability-weighted EDF measure.\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n10Figure 9 Riskiest industries by liability-weighted average EDF credit measures\nExamining an alternative measure of industry risk, we compile the percentage of firms within an industry that have EDF values greater\nthan the 90th percentile of the EDF value distribution for the entire population. At the end of August 2020, for the population of\nNorth American non-financial firms, this threshold value was 25.13%. Figure 10 lists the riskiest industries using this measure. The\nlist is largely consistent with the list obtained using the other measure. Again, the Oil, Gas & Coal Exploration/Production industry\nis ranked as the riskiest, with almost 30% of firms above the threshold. Consumer Products, Consumer Services, and Consumer\nProducts Retail and Wholesale appear on this list, consistent with a substantial drop in demand.\nFigure 10 Riskiest industries by percentage of firms with EDF values greater than threshold\n3.2 Industries with the largest credit risk increase\nThe sharp elevation in credit risk is more apparent when we look at year-over-year increases in EDF values within each industry. From\nAugust 2019 through August 2020, most industries in the North American corporate space experienced substantial increases in\ncredit risk: the median EDF value for all industries as a whole has increased by about 20% from a year ago. The industries with the\nlargest percentage increases are reported on the chart on the left in Figure 11, where we find industries heavily engaged in travel\nand leisure, such as Transportation and Hotels & Restaurants. Among these industries, the median EDF value for Transportation\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n11increased almost by fivefold in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The chart on the right side of Figure 11 presents the distribution of\nchanges across all industries, which is skewed, with a median percentage increase of 22.2%.\nFigure 11 Industries with the largest increases in liabilities-weighted EDF credit measures\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n124. Credit migration\nThis section analyzes credit quality shift from both the change in agency rating and the change in EDF-implied rating (EIR). The\nagency rating is more latent, reflecting the credit risk ranking of a firm over a long period of time, and is thus more stable. On the\nother hand, the EIR is calibrated monthly, and is, therefore, more point-in-time but also more volatile.\nFigure 12 shows the mapping between EDF values and the corresponding implied ratings for North American non-financials as of\nAugust 2020. EDF values within the lower bound and upper bound are mapped to the corresponding rating class. The resulting\nEIRs are then compared to their counterparts in August 2019. Figure 11 shows the differences, along with the differences in agency\nratings.\nFigure 12 EDF-implied rating mapping for North American non-financials\nInvestment Grade High-Yield\nRating Median Lower Bound Upper Bound Rating Median Lower Bound Upper Bound\nAaa 0.0100% 0.0100% 0.0126% Ba1 0.2127% 0.1539% 0.2938%\nAa1 0.0159% 0.0126% 0.0178% Ba2 0.4060% 0.2938% 0.4707%\nAa2 0.0200% 0.0178% 0.0214% Ba3 0.5458% 0.4707% 0.6328%\nAa3 0.0229% 0.0214% 0.0245% B1 0.7337% 0.6328% 0.8507%\nA1 0.0262% 0.0245% 0.0280% B2 0.9864% 0.8507% 1.2989%\nA2 0.0300% 0.0280% 0.0335% B3 1.7105% 1.2989% 2.2525%\nA3 0.0374% 0.0335% 0.0418% Caa1 2.9663% 2.2525% 3.9062%\nBaa1 0.0467% 0.0418% 0.0522% Caa2 5.1440% 3.9062% 6.2174%\nBaa2 0.0584% 0.0522% 0.0806% Caa3 7.5147% 6.2174% 10.9780%\nBaa3 0.1114% 0.0806% 0.1539% Ca 16.0375% 10.9780% 28.3174%\nLooking at the histogram of differences in ratings between August 2019 and August 2020 (Figure 13), even though the\nagency ratings suggest that the longer-term credit risk for the majority of the firms have changed little, we see a positive\nskewness for the EIR, suggesting clear, immediate credit deterioration, in line with other credit metrics.\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n13Figure 13 Change in agency rating and EDF-implied rating (EIR): August 2020 vs. August 2019\n5. Summary\nThe EDF levels for North American corporates saw a moderate retreat in August 2020 from their recent multi-year high. This\nretreat coincided with the recovery in equity markets as well as other credit metrics such as five-year credit default swap (CDS)\nspreads and option-adjusted spreads (OAS). Nevertheless, with volatility still heightened, EDFs levels remained historically\nelevated. Substantial risk is still apparent in oil and consumer-related industries, which ranked high on the list by either the\nmagnitude of EDF level increases compared to a year before or the liability-weighted EDF measure.\nAs the impact from the pandemic continues to unfold, the EDF remains an accurate and responsive measure of credit risk. We will\ncontinue to monitor the changes in credit risk profiles for North American corporate firms and industries, and publish relevant\nreports accordingly.\nEDF REPORT AUGUST 2020 FOR NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE FIRMS\n14© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
