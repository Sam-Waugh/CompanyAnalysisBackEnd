This relocation process, called\nnearshoring or friendshoring, is happening already in North America and is greatly benefiting the area thanks\nto the advantages provided by the trilateral trade agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Mexico\nis becoming the main destination of nearshoring in North America.\nNearshoring is certainly producing benefits, but it is also generating inconveniences, as it attracts producers\nfrom other regions to Mexico with the purpose of accessing the U.S. market—particularly Asian producers\nsubject to higher U.S. tariffs and restrictions. This is triggering concerns in the U.S. about the possibility\nof triangulation of China’s imports to the U.S. via Mexico. By analyzing data on the volume of Mexico’s\nimports from China and Mexico’s exports of manufacturing products to the U.S., we can gain some insight\nabout this potential trade triangulation. Our examination does not rule out the possibility that some products\nexported to the U.S. from Mexico are being generated outside Mexico.\nOverview\nMexico has strengthened its trade and investment links with the U.S. thanks to the privileged status\ngranted by the North American Free Trade Agreement since 1994. More recently, the country has been\nbenefiting not only as a result of the U.S. tariff policy implemented against China but also because of the\nongoing relocation of global supply chains, a phenomenon fueled by the pandemic and geopolitical events.\nMexico recently displaced China as the main trade provider to the U.S. market. However, Mexico has not\nbeen exempted from trade frictions, as lately the U.S. does not perceive Mexico’s friendly neighbor status\nas strong.\nIn the three-decade life of the trilateral trade agreement that involves Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, the\nvalue of Mexican exports has increased by more than tenfold, and Mexico’s trade balance with the U.S. has\nimproved significantly, from a deficit of $2.4 billion in 1993 to a stratospheric surplus of $234.7 billion in\n2023. U.S. direct investment pouring into Mexico has multiplied from $3.5 billion in 1993 to $20 billion in\n2023; this is not only in terms of new investments but also reinvestments, an indication of the degree of\nU.S. corporations’ confidence in Mexico (see Chart 1).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 2Chart 1: Mexico Trade Balance With the U.S.\n$ bil, NSA\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nSources: Central Bank of Mexico, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 1\nHowever, with the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump to office in 2017 and as a result of his policy of\nbringing jobs back to the U.S., the trilateral trade agreement faced headwinds, and China’s exports to the\nU.S. were penalized with higher tariffs. Fortunately, the trilateral agreement was renegotiated, and the\nUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement entered into force in mid-2020. Mexico’s trade with the U.S. did\nnot suffer during the negotiation period as the country’s surplus with its northern neighbor continued to\nswell. Since 2021, trade tariffs on China have been ratified and extended under U.S. President Joe Biden.\nAs a result, China lost its status as the main trade partner for goods to the U.S. market. The proportion of\nChinese imports to the U.S. fell significantly in the past two years from almost 19% at the start of 2022\nto only 13.5% at the end of 2023.1 Meanwhile, U.S. imports from Mexico gained space and increased to\naround 16% at the end of 2023 from 13.5% at the start of 2022, making Mexico the main provider of products\nto the U.S. market and pushing China to second place at the end of 2022. Canada then pushed China to\nthird place in the last quarter of 2023 (see Chart 2).\nMexico has become a net beneficiary of the U.S. tariff policy toward China, as indicated by its market gain\nin the past few years. It also benefited from the prolonged disruption in supply chains caused by the pan-\ndemic response, which forced U.S. companies to find closer and more reliable providers. Mexico, being part\nof the three-decade-long trilateral trade agreement, fully qualified to benefit from the relocation of some\nU.S. plants and investments. Also, given Mexico’s geographical closeness to the largest market in the world,\nthe country also attracted plants and investments from China and other Asian countries. As a result, foreign\ndirect investment into Mexico accelerated after the pandemic, and prospects continue to improve as other\ncorporations express interest in investing in Mexico.\nNearshoring is also introducing some inconveniences to U.S.-Mexico trade relations. Some Asian companies\nare interested in moving to or expanding their production plants in Mexico to take advantage of the USMCA\ntrilateral trade agreement by complying with the agreement’s regional content requirements and conse-\nquently accessing the U.S. market under preferential tariffs. Bilateral trade frictions have always existed,\n1 Bureau of Economic Analysis. “U.S. International Trade in Goods”\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 3Chart 2: U.S. Main Import Providers\n% of total U.S. imports of goods, SA\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n22Q1 22Q2 22Q3 22Q4 23Q1 23Q2 23Q3 23Q4\nChina Mexico Canada\nSources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 2\nbut they have increased in the past few years mainly as a result of measures taken by Mexico’s government\nto limit private competition in key sectors of the economy such as oil and electricity, which adversely\naffect some U.S. firms and Canadian investors. These issues could limit the benefits of nearshoring in the\nlonger term.\nMeanwhile, nearshoring is a reality for Mexico; however, to take full advantage of this process, Mexico must\nimprove the business climate and provide the infrastructure required by global players.\nNearshoring: The positives and negatives\nBenefits\nNearshoring can be defined as the process of relocating production plants and investments from one country\nor region to another one closer to an important market with the purposes of ensuring the supply of inputs\nand products and reducing production costs. Nearshoring is usually accompanied by friendshoring, a relo-\ncation process that includes the selection of a place that provides a friendly environment for doing business\nand a political democracy that respects property rights.\nThe arrival of investments and plants to Mexico is essentially a nearshoring process triggered by three factors.\nFirst, the proliferation of protectionist policies has sought to shield local producers from unfair trade practices\nthrough the imposition of import tariffs. Second, the disruption in supply chains introduced by the COVID-19\npandemic contributed to an extended paralysis in production and distribution processes given the shutdown\nof international borders and transportation. Third, geopolitical events (including the Russia-Ukraine war and\nChina-Taiwan frictions) added disruptions in the supply and distribution of commodities and manufactur-\ning inputs. Production and consumption markets were forced to seek closer providers to reduce the risk of\nlogistics disruption.\nThe benefits of nearshoring are diverse for both the promoter and the receiver of the relocation. It strengthens\nthe trade partnership and integration of supply chains, increases the flow of investment and trade, stimulates\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 4the transfer of technology and consequently productivity, and promotes economic growth and labor. In\nthe case of U.S.-Mexico nearshoring, both countries greatly benefit. U.S. corporations relocate to Mexico\nproduction plants that have operated overseas and mainly in China to ensure the supply of inputs from a\nvery close partner just across the border, improving logistics and reducing costs. On the other side, Mexico\nreceives increasing flows of direct investments, new technology, the possibility to create more and better-paid\nemployment, and increased trade with its main trading partner and the largest market in the world.\nIn 2023 the flow of foreign direct investment into Mexico increased about 30% from the year before,\ndiscounting the merger and acquisition of two corporations operating in Mexico. Certainly, the U.S. is the\nlargest contributor of FDI to Mexico. This was particularly the case in 2023, when the U.S. represented\naround 45% of Mexico’s total FDI. Looking at the amount of FDI in 2023, one cannot find direct evidence of\nthe contribution provided by nearshoring in terms of new investments coming from abroad. This is because\nan important part of the FDI associated with nearshoring is recorded as reinvestments made by foreign\ncorporations already operating in Mexico, which implies that those firms are using profits to expand their\nplants and capacity in the country. Thus, while reinvestments represented only 40% of total FDI in 2021,\nthey increased their participation to 74% in 2023.\nA number of announcements by foreign companies regarding their plans to invest in Mexico confirm the\nreality of this nearshoring trend. Mexico’s Ministry of Finance estimates that such announcements accounted\nfor around $74 billion of FDI through October 2023,2 including investments in energy, railroads, and trans-\nportation and communication. An update from announcements made through the first three months of\n2024 accounts for another $31.5 billion.3 The automotive sector is a key player in expressions of interest to\nexpand in Mexico by companies such as Tesla, BMW, Ford and GM along with Asian manufacturers including\nBYD and KIA.\nThe main trade-off for Mexico is that it must commit to creating and improving the infrastructure required\nby these global players to ensure that the nearshoring and its benefits materialize. Improved roads, ports,\nairports, and expanded basic infrastructure for water and electricity (particularly from renewable energy)\nare needed as well as improved and expedited business processes.\nInconveniences\nWhile Mexico reaps many benefits from nearshoring, the U.S. also sees gains mainly in terms of ensured\nsupplies of inputs and products from its next-door neighbor at cheaper costs of production and transporta-\ntion. However, nearshoring is also attracting the relocation of non-U.S. plants and investments to Mexico,\nparticularly from countries facing nonpreferential treatment by the U.S. China and some other Asian countries\nthat face tariff restrictions from the U.S. view relocation to Mexico as a way to access the U.S. market under\nthe preferential treatment granted by the USMCA. This could be possible if a Chinese manufacturer relocates or\nopens a production plant in Mexican territory and complies with the established regional content requirements,\nknown as the rule of origin or ROO, in the trilateral agreement.\nAsian automakers already exist in Mexico. However, the U.S. trade policy on tariffs for Chinese products\nseems to be a factor accelerating the relocation of Chinese manufacturers to Mexico. An example of this\nis China’s BYD, which began selling electric cars in Mexico in 2023 and announced intentions to build a manu-\n2 Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público “Comunicado No.68”\n3 Secretaría de Economía “Comunicado de Prensa”, 15 de Marzo, 2024.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 5facturing plant there, even though BYD has said it will focus only on the domestic market.4 Mexican media\nalso has reported about Tesla’s intentions to open a plant in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, with an\nestimated investment of $10 billion, and KIA’s expansion, which will account for $6 billion. Whether these\nplants materialize or not, they are already being taken into account by Mexican authorities, particularly the\nMinistry of Economics.\nMeanwhile, on the U.S. side, there is increased demand to enforce the trade policy to protect domestic\nproducers and to investigate potential unfair trade practices in the auto and steel industries involving Mexico.\nRegarding China’s threat to America’s auto industry via Mexico,5 the most recent example is the Alliance for\nAmerican Manufacturing raising the alarm over China’s plant expansions in Mexico and their access to the\nU.S. market by taking advantage of more favorable tariffs under the USMCA. A second example is the U.S.\nclaim about a potential triangulation of steel and aluminum products via Mexico.6\nSuspicions are increasing about Mexico being used as a back door to redirect Chinese imports into the U.S.\nA recent press release from Xeneta, a platform specializing in ocean freight rate benchmarking and market\nintelligence, reported a “massive increase in container shipping imports from China into Mexico,”7 raising\nsuspicion that some of those Chinese imports could end up in the U.S. as importers try to avoid U.S. tariffs.\nSearching for signs of triangulation\nMexico’s imports from China have maintained a relatively stable proportion of around 19% of the total in\nthe past four years, though they doubled from $5.5 billion in 2016 to $10 billion in 2023. The expansion\nbegan in 2021, when imports from China grew 37%. Growth moderated to 17% in 2022 and contracted 4%\nin 2023. In terms of current-dollar value, the data do not show evidence of a steady Chinese import pen-\netration in Mexico. There is a counterargument, however, that the data reflect the influence of prices. For\nexample, if import prices declined significantly, then the volume of Chinese imports could have increased.\nThe number of containers arriving in Mexico from China is an additional piece of information that supports\nthe argument of a massive arrival of Chinese imports into Mexico. According to Xeneta’s report, the number\nof containers expanded at an annual rate of 60% in January 2024, growing from 73,000 units to 117,000\nunits. Certainly, there has been a significant expansion in the past two years, with the number of containers\nincreasing 3.5% in 2022 and 35% in 2023. Therefore, the analysis must focus on volume of trade, which is\ndefined as trade in constant prices, rather than on current-dollar value.\nAs a first attempt to search for more solid evidence, we perform a two-step data analysis about the volume\nof imports from China to Mexico and the volume of Mexico’s exports of manufacturing products to the U.S.\nThis analysis will help us to gain some insights about the possibility of a triangulation of Chinese imports\ninto the U.S. that are wrapped as Mexican exports. The first step will allow us to determine if there are signs\nof a Chinese import penetration to Mexico in the past few years, and the second will help us to see the\ndegree of correlation between the volume of Mexico’s manufacturing exports to the U.S. and the country’s\nmanufacturing capacity and employment. If the volume of Mexico’s manufacturing exports has expanded\nin an environment of unchanged capacity utilization and employment, that would be an indication that the\nextra volume exported comes from somewhere else. One source may be an improvement in productivity,\n4 Yahoo Finance, “BYD not planning to come to the U.S.”, February 27, 2024.\n5 American Manufacturing Org. On a Collision Course.\n6 USTR, Press Release, September 29, 2023.\n7 Xeneta, Press Release, March 15, 2024.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 6in this case defined as the increase in output using the same number of inputs. If that is the case, then data\nshould not show a decrease in employment. In other words, if employment has decreased and the use of\ncapacity remains the same, then someone is producing the extra volume exported to the U.S. The same\napplies to the case of capacity utilization.\nHas the volume of Chinese imports to Mexico expanded?\nAfter plunging in the first half of 2020 because of the disruptions after the COVID-19 outbreak, the\nvolume of total imports from China recovered to the pre-pandemic level by the third quarter of 2021 and\nremained relatively stable in 2022. Since then, import volume from China has expanded. It grew 22% in the\nsecond quarter of 2023 and averaged around 20% annual growth for the last three quarters of the year. For\nall of 2023, volume surged 14% over the 2022 level (see Chart 3), while the value of imports contracted\n4%. A trend of increased Chinese imports appears to be extending into 2024 as indicated by the signif-\nicant increase in the number of containers reported by Xeneta, and because the value of imports from China\nexpanded 12% annually in January amid a 1% decrease in the total value of Mexico’s imports. It is important to\nremark that most of Mexico’s imports from China are nonoil products, with manufacturing imports being\nan important contributor.\nChart 3: Mexico’s Volume of Imports From China\n2018$ bil, SA\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n19Q4 20Q1 20Q2 20Q3 20Q4 21Q1 21Q2 21Q3 21Q4 22Q1 22Q2 22Q3 22Q4 23Q1 23Q2 23Q3 23Q4\nSources: Central Bank of Mexico, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 3\nSo far, the data show evidence that the volume of imports from China expanded in 2023, even though the\nvalue decreased as mentioned before. One explanation lies in the decrease of import prices resulting from\nthe strength of the Mexican peso during the year. In this case, Mexico bought cheaper products from China\nthanks to the strong peso. Another potential explanation could be that China sold its products at discounted\nprices to Mexico. In this case, China wanted to gain a market in Mexico. The main conclusion here is that the\nvolume of imports from China has certainly expanded and increased its participation in Mexico’s total imports\nby 1.5 percentage points from 2017 when U.S. President Trump took office. This could be explained as a delib-\nerate Chinese policy to diversify its trade markets given the U.S. restrictions imposed on imports from China\n(see Chart 4).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 7Chart 4: Mexico’s Volume of Imports From China\n% of total imports, SA\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nSources: Central Bank of Mexico, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 4\nHas the volume of Mexico’s manufacturing exports to the U.S. expanded?\nThe U.S. is the main market for Mexican exports with the neighboring country a destination for more than\n80% of Mexico’s total sales abroad. Manufacturing exports represent almost 90% of Mexico’s total exports,\nand manufacturing exports to the U.S. market represent 75% of total exports. This makes manufacturing\nexports the main channel for Mexico to increase its export penetration in the U.S. Thus, our focus is to see if\ndata indicate a gain in market participation for Mexico’s manufacturing exports to the U.S. In the past two\nyears, Mexico’s manufacturing exports gained 1.1 percentage points as a proportion of total exports, and\nmanufacturing exports to the U.S. gained 1.7 percentage points in the total. This is an indication that Mexico\nhas exported more volume of manufacturing products to the U.S. in the past two years (see Chart 5).\nChart 5: Mexico’s Volume of Exports of Goods\n% of total exports of goods, SA\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n21 22 23\nTotal manufacturing exports Manufacturing exports to U.S.\nSources: Central Bank of Mexico, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 5\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 8If that extra volume of manufacturing exports is explained by more employment and increased capacity\nutilization, then there is no doubt that Mexico has increased its domestic capacity to produce more exports.\nBy including employment in manufacturing production in the analysis, we see that jobs increased 2.4%\nfrom the end of 2022 to the end of 2023. Thus, the industry has certainly occupied more workers in the\npast year, which in principle could explain the increase in production and consequently in the volume of\nproducts exported. Moreover, capacity utilization by manufacturers decreased 3% in the same period. This\nraises two questions: Why are more workers now using less capacity? And, in the absence of an increase in\nproductivity, would not more workers use more capacity instead of less (see Chart 6)?\nChart 6: Exports, Employment and Capacity Utilization\nY-axes: 2018=100 (L), % of total capacity (R)\n120 120\n110\n110\n100\n100\n90\n90 80\n70\n80\n60\n70\n50\n60 40\n16Q1 17Q1 18Q1 19Q1 20Q1 21Q1 22Q1 23Q1\nManufacturing exports Manufacturing exports to U.S. Manufacturing employment Capacity utilization\nSources: INEGI, Central Bank of Mexico, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 6\nThe insights gained only leave the door open to the possibility that the increase in the volume of\nmanufacturing production, without utilizing more capacity, could be partly explained by products\ngenerated outside of Mexico.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NearshoriNg aNd PoteNtial trade triaNgulatioN 9About the Author\nAlfredo Coutino is a director at Moody’s Analytics.
