The Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, also known as CECL,\nwas released in June 2016 and is in operation for reporting periods after December 15, 2019 (effectively January 2020). The\nguidance enables financial institutions to put aside reserves for the total lifetime expected loss of a financial instrument at the\ndate of origination based on a reasonable and supportable forecast of future conditions. As such, it tries to resolve the “too\nlittle/too late” problem observed during the 2008 crisis, allowing financial institutions to reserve for downturns during good times.\nMarch 31, 2020, was the first quarter end in which all banks that adopted as of January 2020 were to publish their estimates of\nallowance for credit loss for the first time. Unexpectedly, the March 31 time period also coincided with the COVID-19 crisis, which\nturned all macroeconomic forecasts into turmoil, bringing about much-touted volatility in the newly minted measure of\nallowance. All indicators are pointing to a high expected level of volatility as shown by the recent report on global speculative-\ngrade default rate by our sister company Moody’s Investors Service (Figure 2). Thus, executive management needs a well-rounded\nset of measures to understand the range of estimates for the new CECL standard for its own institution as well as its peers.\nGlobal speculative-grade default rate will rise to 9.0% by May 2021\nSource: Moody’s Investors Service1\nWe set out to estimate, based on 14 top financial institutions, a lower- and upper-bound CECL estimate as of March 31, 2020.\nUsing individual institutions’ experiences and a few other heuristics measures, we seek a method that can help triangulate on a\nreasonable range of reserves as of March 31, and establish a methodology that can be used for future quarters. Given that CECL\nprovides for a broad range of assumptions, we want to understand which institutions have built reserves aggressively (higher end\nof the range) versus those that will build over time (lower end of the range). We believe our methodology can be highly useful in\ntimes of uncertainty when events such as COVID-19 cloud the economic outlook. In the next sections, we will:\n» Review a sample set of banks in our dataset\n» Explain methodologies used as benchmarks\n» Establish a triangulation method\n» Review dataset average results\n» Review bank-specific results\n1 MIS – May 2020 Default Report: https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1228751\n3 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Different approaches to triangulate on a range of estimates\nIn our analysis, we will use the disclosed amounts reported by the 14 financial institutions as part of their Q1 2020 Call Report\n(Figure 3).\nTop 14 banks – allowance for credit loss disclosures\nACL Q1\namount\nBank name ($MM) Assets size Total loans ACL Q1 % (3/31)\nJPM 2 ,367,127 948,881 2.50% 25,400\nBoA 1 ,812,976 968,579 1.63% 17,126\nWells 1,708,548 9 38,694 1.19% 12,022\nCiti 1,472,915 659,787 3.14% 22,654\nUSB 477,394 299,090 2.07% 6,590\nTruist 4 51,310 305,651 1.78% 5,446\nPNC 395,783 239,570 1.66% 4,394\nFifth Third 169,489 110,591 2.02% 2,236\nAlly 1 67,073 124,298 2.54% 3,245\nCFG 164,652 119,745 1.73% 2,213\nKey 1 45,184 9 5,273 1.28% 1,520\nRegions 1 27,543 83,334 1.89% 1,665\nM&T 125,041 89,681 1.47% 1 ,380\nHuntington 108,790 75,893 2.05% 1 ,603\nSource: FDIC Call Report Data Q1 2020\nOur aim is to understand (based on a range of measures) which institutions may be taking a more- or less-aggressive approach to\nreserving given current and future conditions as of March 31, 2020.2 We use multiple angles to attack the problem by relying on\nhistorical net charge-off history, Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) exercise results, top-down forecasting models, and macro-\nassumptions–based analysis to triangulate on the expected amount of allowance. Our approach entails computing each of these\nmeasures at an institution level, as well as generating averages to help understand the convergence of results. Once all calculation\nresults are completed, we will use a method to triangulate on upper- and lower-bound range expectations for the March 31 date.\nWe provide the methodology so institutions can evaluate their results, as well as those of their peers, and understand whether\nthey rank on the upper- or lower-bound of expected results at any given time.\nCECL is in its first quarter of adoption. Thus, historical experience will take time to build, and every institution will want to\nunderstand where they stand within their peer group, their own historical experience, and their current portfolio mix. A common\nset of triangulation metrics can help standardize how institutions look at their estimates given where we are in the business cycle.\nWhile economic conditions have deteriorated since March 31, we will do our best to understand if institutions determined whether\nthey had appropriate reserves based on data as of March 31. Also, we should be able to tell which institutions will have to ramp up\nreserves much more aggressively in the coming months.\n2 Moody’s Analytics issued two sets of economic scenarios in March due to the rapidly deteriorating environment. The March V2 scenario represents the mid-\ncycle update to all thematic scenarios in March.\n4 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Methodology for each approach and assumptions\nWe lay out the five different approaches that will help provide some benchmarks and triangulation metrics for the results of each\ninstitution in our analysis. We emphasize that this methodology should be useful to tackle any bank’s triangulation exercise. While\nwe opted to present results at the bank level, portfolio-level analysis would work in the same manner. In brief, we will use:\n» DFAST results: we use the total loss ratio and the DFAST/expected credit loss (ECL) coverage ratio to understand how well-\nreserved banks are. The DFAST losses are based on the nine-quarter cumulative losses under the severely adverse scenarios.\nWe also create a DFAST scaler for added differentiation across DFAST banks.\n» NCO averages for 2007-2010: using net charge-offs (NCOs) observed during the Great Recession, we will estimate, based\non quarterly maximum and average NCO during the Great Recession, how many quarters of coverage are provided for in the\nbank's current estimates.\n» NCO under economic conditions: using NCOs observed at different levels of economic conditions based on unemployment\nlevels (UERs), we estimate potential reserves based on a weighted average life assumption given the forecast UER levels as of\nMarch 31, 2020.\n» Historical CECL – full foresight: using historical full foresight analysis, we compute the maximum, minimum, and average\nobserved lifetime loss through the Great Recession.\n» CECL forecaster: using Moody’s Analytics CECL forecaster,3 we compute the product level NCOs, and based on a set of CECL\nassumptions, compute the lifetime loss estimate as of March 31, 2020.\nWe provide a detailed overview of the calculation methods for each of these approaches and the results that can be easily\nreplicated with a little time and effort.4\n.\nDFAST results\nThe first set of results is used purely as a comparison point with the Q1 allowance for credit losses (ACL) estimate and for\nqualitative commentary in the bank-specific results section. The 2020 DFAST results were used. Although we could have\nintegrated the results within our framework, we decided against it to keep the methodology simpler, especially for smaller banks\nthat may not have similar data to rely on. The DFAST results are very useful to establish a relative measure of portfolio-specific\nriskiness that top-down models do not capture.\nThe DFAST exercise is meant to offer a view of a bank's capital resilience under stressful market conditions. It is used by regulatory\nagencies to gauge a bank's ability to manage its way out of an economic crisis and was instituted after the 2008 financial crisis to\nraise the level of confidence in the largest financial institutions. Since the metric has been around for so long, it has been used as a\nway to understand how well banks are reserved under CECL. Although they are quite different, both provide a measure of coverage\nfor future losses. Even if the macro factor shocks are not of the same magnitude, the DFAST metrics can help determine the\ncomparative riskiness of the bank’s portfolios given the bottom-up nature of the Federal Reserve models. To understand the\nlimitations of the comparisons between the two, one must understand the major differences, as shown in Figure 4.\n3 CECL forecaster is based on Moody’s Call Report Forecast: https://www.economy.com/products/data/forecast-bank-call-reports\n4 ImpairmentStudio and Capital Risk Analyzer were used for some of the approaches.\n5 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Key differences between CECL and DFAST metrics\nCECL DFAST\nPurpose Determine lifetime expected credit Predict losses over the next nine\nlosses within each portfolio quarters as part of capital adequacy\nexercise\nTime frame Contractual and behavioral life Nine quarters\nScenarios used Must consider reasonable and Federal Reserve DFAST Baseline,\nsupportable forecast—no required Severely Adverse, and banks’\nspecific scenario or number of Idiosyncratic scenarios\nscenarios\nNew business/origination As-of date portfolio only As-of date portfolio + new business\nLines of credit Consideration of new draws Consideration of new draws (all)\n(conditional cancellations only—that\nis, no credit cards)\nFocus Accuracy Conservatism\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nThe 2020 DFAST results5 were released on June 25, 2020. Figure 5 presents the 2020 DFAST results used in our analysis. The\ncoverage ratio (Coverage) metrics are the bank’s disclosed CECL ratio as of March 31, 2020 (ACL Q1 %) divided by the DFAST loss\n% (% loans). The DFAST loss ratio is taken directly from the DFAST results, which are the cumulative losses over nine quarters\ndivided by the loan average balances over the forecast horizon for the DFAST exercise. For Citibank, the information from the\ncoverage ratio can be interpreted to mean that its current reserve level would enable it to absorb 47% of the nine cumulative\nnine-quarter losses, or approximately 4.5 quarters’ worth of losses.\nWhen contrasting two banks (for example, Citi and Fifth Third), we observe that both have very high losses in the DFAST exercise,\nyet they are diametrically opposite when looking at their coverage ratio—Citi having one of the highest coverages and Fifth Third\none of the lowest. These indicators alone do not give enough information to render judgment, but when combined with other\nmetrics they will provide insights.\nDFAST coverage ratio for the peer group and portfolio loss rates\nFirst-lien Junior liens Commercial\nmortgages, and HELOCs, Commercial real estate, Other\nBank name ACL Q1 % Coverage % loans domestic domestic and industrial domestic Credit cards consumer Other loans\nJPM 2.50% 38% 6.60% 1.50% 2.00% 11.30% 3.20% 16.10% 3.90% 4.70%\nBoA 1.19% 35% 4.70% 1.20% 2.40% 5.30% 6.60% 16.00% 2.00% 3.00%\nWells 1.63% 24% 4.90% 1.20% 2.50% 6.70% 8.00% 18.70% 5.60% 4.10%\nCiti 3.14% 47% 6.70% 1.90% 6.60% 4.70% 5.70% 16.40% 10.20% 2.30%\nUSB 2.07% 36% 5.80% 1.50% 4.20% 6.90% 7.10% 18.10% 3.70% 4.80%\nTruist 1.78% 35% 5.10% 1.80% 2.80% 6.00% 5.80% 18.10% 7.10% 3.50%\nPNC 1.66% 33% 5.10% 1.30% 1.60% 6.40% 6.30% 19.90% 4.10% 2.70%\nFifth Third 2.54% 30% 6.80% 2.10% 3.90% 7.50% 10.80% 23.50% 5.20% 4.30%\nAlly 1.73% 40% 6.40% 1.30% 4.10% 6.40% 3.70% 0.00% 7.70% 11.10%\nCFG 1.47% 31% 5.60% 1.70% 4.10% 6.20% 8.10% 16.40% 6.50% 4.00%\nKey 2.02% 24% 5.30% 2.40% 3.10% 6.50% 6.80% 18.70% 5.10% 3.00%\nRegions 1.28% 30% 6.30% 2.40% 4.40% 7.80% 9.30% 18.70% 11.80% 3.00%\nM&T 1.89% 27% 5.50% 2.80% 3.40% 6.20% 6.20% 18.70% 6.60% 4.60%\nHuntington 2.05% 40% 5.10% 2.70% 3.10% 6.10% 7.70% 18.70% 4.60% 3.80%\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and Federal Reserve DFAST Results 2020\n5 https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-dfast-results-20200625.pdf\n6 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Figure 6 puts the loss coverage for each bank into perspective, highlighting banks that are either above or below the average for\nthe group, case in point the Citi and Fifth Third example discussed above. The purple line represents the average for the sample\nset.\nBanks on average had a coverage ratio of 33%, with some falling well below (M&T 27%, Wells 24%, and Key 24%) while others\nwere well above (Huntington 40%, Citi 47%, and Ally 40%). The actual DFAST loss estimates gives us a view of the banks'\nportfolio riskiness.\nACL Q1, DFAST loss %, and coverage\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and Federal Reserve DFAST Results 2020\nIn Figure 7, we present the DFAST-based riskiness scaler that will enable us to establish a relative risk ranking of the banks based on\nthe bottom-up DFAST loss estimates computed by the Federal Reserve. For each portfolio, we created a risk scaler based on the\nbank’s loss ratio divided by the overall DFAST loss ratio observed, which gave us the relative riskiness of each portfolio across banks\n(since they were derived using the same Federal Reserve based model). Then, we proceeded to create a bank-level scaler by\nweighting each of the portfolio scalers by ratio of portfolio outstanding balance divided by the total portfolio balances for each\nbank. The rank ordering will be useful when comparing individual bank results and enable us to capture relative risk differences.\nFigure 7 presents the final rank ordering by portfolios prior to weighting for the bank-level portfolio scaler. The total scaler is the\nbank-level scaler.\nOn the portfolio-level scalers, we can observe that since JPM had a first mortgage portfolio DFAST loss rate equal to 1.5% (see\nFigure 5) and the DFAST peer group average was 1.5%, the scaler for JPM was 1.00. On the bank-level scalers, we can see that\nPNC, Citi, and BofA are at the lower end of the spectrum, whereas Regions, Fifth Third, and M&T are on the higher end of the\nspectrum. This signifies that their portfolios as a whole are much riskier than the average DFAST banking group.\n7 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Bank DFAST-based riskiness scaler at product and bank level\nFirst-lien Junior liens and\nmortgages, HELOCs, Commercial Commercial real Other\nBank name domestic domestic and industrial estate, domestic Credit cards consumer Other loans Total Scaler\nJPM 1.00 0.65 1.57 0.51 0.94 0.60 1.31 1.07\nBoA 0.80 0.77 0.74 1.05 0.94 0.31 0.83 0.78\nWells 0.80 0.81 0.93 1.27 1.09 0.86 1.14 0.98\nCiti 1.27 2.13 0.65 0.90 0.96 1.57 0.64 0.86\nUSB 1.00 1.35 0.96 1.13 1.06 0.57 1.33 0.99\nTruist 1.20 0.90 0.83 0.92 1.06 1.09 0.97 0.99\nPNC 0.87 0.52 0.89 1.00 1.16 0.63 0.75 0.84\nFifth Third 1.40 1.26 1.04 1.71 1.37 0.80 1.19 1.18\nAlly 0.87 1.32 0.89 0.59 0.00 1.18 3.08 1.05\nCFG 1.13 1.32 0.86 1.29 0.96 1.00 1.11 1.06\nKey 1.60 1.00 0.90 1.08 1.09 0.78 0.83 0.98\nRegions 1.60 1.42 1.08 1.48 1.09 1.82 0.83 1.29\nM&T 1.87 1.10 0.86 0.98 1.09 1.02 1.28 1.12\nHuntington 1.80 1.00 0.85 1.22 1.09 0.71 1.06 1.04\nDFAST averages 1.50 3.10 7.20 6.30 17.10 6.50 3.60\nSource: Moody’s Analytics, FDIC Call Report and Federal Reserve DFAST Results 2020\nFinally, we put the DFAST and CECL economic scenarios into perspective when comparing the DFAST Severely Adverse scenario to\nthe Moody’s Analytics Baseline CECL scenario as of March 31, 2020 (Figure 8). The latter seems more acute at the onset but\nrecovers more quickly than the DFAST scenarios, whereas the S4 scenario6 is much more severe than the DFAST Severely Adverse.\nWe can intuitively assume that a coverage ratio averaging ~20-40% would be acceptable given the differences between the\nDFAST scenarios and the Moody’s Analytics Baseline as of March 31, 2020.\nMarch 2020 v2 unemployment rate versus CCAR 2020\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and Federal Reserve DFAST 2020 Scenarios\nIn our analysis, we intend to use the DFAST results loss ratio in our upper-bound index and use the DFAST riskiness scaler as a\nmeasure of a bank’s individual portfolio riskiness to provide a distinction between each institution's reserves as of March 31, 2020.\nNCO averages 2007-2010\nWe look at the historical losses experienced during the Great Recession to gauge how long the current level of reserves would last\nif history repeats itself. We know that COVID-19 caused rapid and deep shock to the economy, so this information will help us put\nit into perspective. Under this approach, we compared the historical losses to what each bank recorded for its Q1 2020 allowance.\nThese losses are based on the net loss amounts that the institution charged off for each quarter from Q1 2007 to Q4 2010.\n6 S4 scenario is part of the thematic Moody’s Analytics scenarios; it depicts a protracted slump in the economy where only 4% of possible economic scenarios\nare worse.\n8 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?There are two statistics considered for the 2007-2010 NCO experience (Figure 9):\n» NCO % Max: the numerator is the maximum quarterly charge-off amount and the denominator is the average of total loans\nfrom Q1 2007 to Q4 2010.\n» NCO % average: the numerator is the average of net losses from Q1 2007 to Q4 2010 and the denominator is the average\nof total loans from Q1 2007 to Q4 2010.\nMaximum and average NCO 2007-2010 versus Q1 2020 ACL %\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC Call Report Data\nIf history were to repeat itself and we experienced the same losses today that we experienced during the Great Recession, then\nwould our current lifetime loss estimates have sufficient coverage, and for how long? To answer this, we further analyze the NCO\n% max and NCO % average by calculating the ratio of each institution's ACL Q1 % to the NCO % max or the NCO % average\n(Figure 10).\nUsing JPM as an example, the maximum net charge-off amount recorded between 2007 and 2010 was $5.1 billion. The average\nquarterly net charge-off amount over the 16-quarter time span was $2.4 billion. The average total loan amount over this same\nperiod was $625 billion. The NCO max % is 0.90%. The NCO % average is 0.46%. JPM’s Q1 2020 ACL of 2.5% would provide\ncoverage of 2.79 quarters using a quarterly NCO rate of 0.90%.

We find three institutions (Ally, Fifth Third, and CFG) seem to have outsized NCO experience based on the\nfinancial crisis portfolio composition for these institutions. Thus, NCO max and averages may not represent a good benchmark for\nCECL comparison unless some idiosyncratic adjustments were made to the historical experience.\nQuarterly coverage based on 2007-2010 NCO experience\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC Call Report Data\nFor added perspective, banks have tightened credit standards since the Great Recession. The economic crisis we face today is\nmuch different as it was triggered by the COVID-19 health pandemic. Countries across the globe responded to contain the spread\nof the virus by shutting down substantial parts of their economies. The current crisis was due to external factors and unfolded\nmuch more rapidly than the past crisis in which the financial markets had internal fundamental issues that took years to correct. It\nis possible this downturn may be shorter with more severe negative growth for a few quarters following by a period of rapid\ngrowth. At this point, one thing both crises have in common is the extreme uncertainty of event development.\nNCO based on scenarios’ assumptions and average life (macro unemployment rate assumptions)\nUnder this approach, we have a heuristic method that uses a simple approximation but one that can be quite intuitive. Our goal\nwith this method is to compute an ECL estimate based on the projected level of unemployment over the weighted-average life of\nthe bank’s loan book, with a reversion to the long-term average in a cliff fashion at 18 months for the remainder of the loan book’s\nlife.\nOur assumptions under this method are as follows, and can be adjusted as necessary:\n» Weighted-average life7of total loan book is 2.5 years.\n» Book runoff: N/A.\n» The long-term loss rate is computed based on the average loss rate when unemployment was in the 4-5% range between\n2016 and 2018.\n» The average loss rate is computed for each 100bps bands from 2008-2018.\n» For unemployment rates not seen previously, we used a scaler:\n- If the rate is between 10-11%, then we scale the 9-10% loss rate by using a multiplier of 1.25. We plotted the impact of\nthis assumption, which falls in line with the overall trend in NCO rates for every institution (note that the Ally loss rate in\nthe red circle is the big outlier) (Figure 12).\n7 We assume a 2.5-year average life with no runoff assumptions, which puts the equivalent portfolio weighted average life on an amortizing basis at around\n4.5-5 years.\n10 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Historical and scaled NCO rates versus unemployment forecasted in baseline scenario\n(colors represent each institution)\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nIf the rate is above 11%, then we scale the 10-11% loss rate by using a multiplier of 1.5. We plotted the impact of this assumption\non the resulting loss rate, which is in line with the overall trends for NCO rates for every institution (note that the Ally loss rate in\nthe red circle is the big outlier) (Figure 13).\nHistorical and scaled NCO rates versus unemployment forecasted in S4 scenario\n(colors represent each institution)\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nIn the S4 scenario (Figure 13), the peak unemployment rate is 16.93% (Figure 14) to which we applied a loss rate based on the\nscaler proposed, the resulting loss rate is neither pessimistic nor optimistic based on the recovery assumptions within the scenario.\nWe intuitively know that the loss rate when unemployment reaches 16% is not going to double based on the 8% unemployment\nlevels.\nFor each bank, we compute the average loss rate, apply the appropriate loss rate for the first 18 months of the forecast, and then\nrevert immediately to the loss rate at the 4-5% range for the next four quarters.

The metrics will fit\nwell as an upper-bound estimate based on our sample set of banks.\nTop-down CECL forecaster methodology\nFor this last set of metrics, we relied on Moody’s Analytics CECL forecaster model,14 which is used to compute a reporting date\nECL under different macroeconomic scenarios based on user assumptions. The tool can also be used to forecast ECL at a different\nprojected point in time (stress testing). The following is a summary of the call report forecast (CRF) methodology used to derive\nthe projected loss rates at the portfolio level for each of the 14 net charge-off categories in the call report. Once the loss rates are\nforecasted, we apply our CECL assumptions for each portfolio inclusive of the average life, long-term loss rate, reasonable and\nsupportable period, reversion period, and interest rate (used to determine amortization).\nWe will first describe the high-level methodology to derive the projected loss rate at the portfolio level using the CRF\nmethodology and then provide all assumptions that were applied to derived the individual bank’s allowance under different\nscenarios.\nThe CRF methodology15 is reductive in nature in the sense that we begin with aggregate industry data and identify\nmacroeconomic forces that affect the entire banking system. We then isolate the trend and cycle from each peer or bank’s market\nshare, leaving us with series that reflect the bank’s own strategic decisions, the effects of its peers’ actions, and other idiosyncratic\nbehavior. This two-layer approach to modeling allows us to disentangle macroeconomic and bank-specific effects. Peer groups can\nbe viewed as an intermediate layer. Doing so lets us differentiate between factors that affect the entire industry and factors that\naffect only the peer group of interest, whether because of geography or because of particular portfolio concentrations.\nOnce all net charge-off (NCO) forecast rates are computed using CRF, we proceed to apply our CECL assumptions to compile life\nof loan estimates. We provide two different versions of assumptions to ground ourselves in the impact of those assumptions:\n14 Capital Risk Analyzer: https://www.moodysanalytics.com/product-list/capital-risk-analyzer\n15 In-depth detail can be found for Call Report Forecast (CRF): https://www.economy.com/products/data/forecast-bank-call-reports\n14 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Expected life and reversion period\nIn version 1, the expected loan life and reversion period are borrowed from the industry-level assumptions provided in the paper by\nCovas and Nelson.16 We apply the assumptions laid out in Figure 18 and revert immediately to the long-term net charge-off rate.\nExpected loan life and length of reversion period\nSource: BPI – Staff working paper 2018-1\nIn version 2, for the expected life and reversion period:\n» Expected life remains the same as version 1\n» Reversion starts at Year 1 and ends at end of Year 3\nLong-term NCO rate\nWe applied the NCO weighted average from 2000 to 2020. The NCO rate is the same for both versions.\nResults aggregation\nAll portfolio-level results are aggregated for each bank after applying the assumptions above for each call report asset category.\nFor Version 1 and Version 2 assumptions:\n» We generate four sets of metrics representing the estimate for each scenario and version (CECLFcst, V1, V2, base [S4]).\n» We generate four sets of metrics representing the next three-year average estimate for each scenario and version (CECLFcst,\nV1, V2, base [S4]).\n» Results are shown in Figure 19 as compared to the Q1 2020 ACL reported by the banks in our sample.\n16 BPI: Staff working paper 2018-1 Current Expected Credit Loss: Lessons from 2007-2009: https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CECL-Lessons-2007-\n2009-WP-July-12-2018.pdf\n15 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?As shown in Figure 19:\n» For the Baseline scenario ACL, for each bank based on Version 1 and Version 2 assumptions, we observed that the reversion\nassumptions do not seem to have a large impact on the estimate.\n» On the other hand, the S4 scenario presents estimates that seem to diverge widely due to the reversion assumption\ndifferences. In the S4 scenario, our V1 assumptions provide for a much longer scenario impact than under our V2\nassumptions, where the reversion occurred immediately after the first year of scenario impact.\nWe see these differences manifesting themselves in a more acute way for JPM, Citi, and Fifth Third. This is one of the effects of the\nCECL methodological choices that one can make to reduce the impact of economic volatility when there is too much uncertainty\naround the forecast of certain economic factors.\nTop-down CECL forecaster – Baseline and S4 version 1 and version 2 assumptions\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC Call Report\nFigure 20 provides detailed estimates based on both sets of assumptions, scenarios, and the quarterly average over the next three\nyears.\nTop 14 banks – top-down CECL forecaster estimates\nCECLFcst V1 CECLFcst V2 CECLFcst V1 CECLFcst V2 CECLFcst Avg 3y V1 CECLFcst Avg 3y CECLFcst Avg CECLFcst Avg 3y\nBank name ACL Q1 % base base S4 S4 base V2 base 3y V1 S4 V2 S4\nJPM 2.50% 2.71% 2.75% 6.56% 5.33% 2.31% 2.36% 4.52% 3.18%\nBoA 1.63% 1.60% 1.66% 3.50% 3.19% 1.41% 1.46% 2.41% 1.94%\nWells 1.19% 1.77% 1.74% 4.21% 3.38% 1.55% 1.46% 3.08% 2.06%\nCiti 3.14% 4.88% 4.71% 11.96% 9.20% 4.17% 3.88% 8.18% 5.35%\nUSB 2.07% 2.11% 2.24% 4.72% 4.21% 1.77% 1.93% 3.09% 2.54%\nTruist 1.78% 1.50% 1.60% 5.04% 2.83% 1.14% 1.21% 4.02% 1.73%\nPNC 1.66% 1.34% 1.57% 2.92% 2.93% 1.09% 1.34% 1.81% 1.80%\nFifth Third 2.02% 4.64% 4.26% 9.72% 7.50% 3.86% 3.17% 6.42% 4.09%\nAlly 2.54% 3.52% 3.75% 7.08% 6.59% 2.50% 2.79% 4.48% 4.07%\nCFG 1.73% 3.52% 3.22% 8.59% 6.69% 2.80% 2.30% 5.97% 3.73%\nKey 1.28% 2.17% 2.06% 5.30% 4.01% 1.85% 1.64% 3.80% 2.34%\nRegions 1.89% 3.67% 3.36% 8.07% 6.52% 2.31% 1.06% 4.90% 2.52%\nM&T 1.47% 1.16% 1.12% 2.50% 2.11% 1.02% 0.95% 1.92% 1.30%\nHuntington 2.05% 2.47% 2.46% 6.18% 5.05% 2.03% 1.90% 4.37% 3.00%\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC Call Report\n16 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?In Figure 21 and Figure 22, we isolate V1 and V2 assumptions and compare those to the Q1 ACL 2020. We find that the baseline\nscenario on average is higher than the bank average ECL disclosed as of Q1 (1.98% versus 2.49%) with some banks—notably Citi,\nAlly, CFG, and Fifth Third—falling well below our baseline estimates. The difference between the Baseline and S4 scenarios gives us\na range of potential outcomes if the scenario gets worse over time (as they did in hindsight). The analysis of these benchmarks\noffers the ability to provide a range of estimates based on different points of view. We will discuss this at length in the\ntriangulation section.\nTop-down CECL forecaster – Baseline and S4 version 1\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC Call Report\nUnder the V2 assumptions, we observe the same pattern except for the range between Baseline and S4, which is much tighter\nthan observed for the V1 assumptions—again, due to the R&S period differences discussed.\nTop-down CECL forecaster – Baseline and S4 version 2\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC Call Report\n17 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?In Figure 23, we provide a view of the three-year quarterly average CECL estimate for V2. This enables us to evaluate the impact of\nthe stress scenario over a longer-term period. Given the rapidly changing nature of the scenarios since the beginning of March and\nthe anticipated continuation of volatility, these metrics may be a better, less volatile estimate for the upper bound of the reporting\ndate forecast (or at least should be considered as such).\nFor example, the Citi CECLFcst V1 S4 scenario estimate equals 12.12%, whereas the three-year average falls to nearly 9.2%. In the\ncase of the CECLFcst V2 S4 scenario, the estimate equals 8.65% to 5.14% for the three-year average as seen in Figure 23.\nTop-down CECL forecaster – Baseline and S4 version 2 three-year average\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC Call Report\nThe CECL forecaster methodology provides another good benchmark to understand a range of values for the CECL estimates at\nthe March 31, 2020 reporting date. We found that, on average, the model overestimates the Baseline scenario when compared to\nthe group average, which could be due to a myriad of reasons including assumptions for reversion, weighted average life, long-\nterm loss rate, and so on. This will be a consideration when setting the lower bound in our triangulation index. In the next section,\nwe discuss how to use the different metrics reviewed in this section to determine a lower and upper bound.\nTriangulation methodology\nOne of the most underrated aspects of the CECL process as of March 31 was the need to establish formal benchmarks to\nunderstand the potential variability in the estimate. All stakeholders going in had a “hunch” that CECL was going to be much more\nvolatile than the incurred loss approach. The incurred loss approach, long viewed as a very stable metric, moved in sync with\ndelinquency indicators, but not so for the lifetime estimate of potential loan losses. The behavior of CECL reserves compared to\nactual delinquency can be very unintuitive at the executive management level.\nWe reviewed five different methodologies that are available to triangulate on a range of possible values as a benchmark to our\nCECL estimate. We separate each into the two classes of metrics defined and summarized below (Figure 24):\n» Riskiness indicators\n- These metrics provide a useful way to think about portfolio riskiness at a specific point, but offers limited ways for these\nmetrics to be incorporated as part of an index to determine an ECL range.\n- These metrics can be used to apply an override on the range of ECL moving the lower or the upper bound, creating a\ntighter (looser) range for the estimate.\n» ECL range indicators\n- These metrics directly provide a range for ECL estimates based on historical experience, forecast of future conditions, or a\nmix of both using heuristics measures. For each metric in our analysis, we have a Baseline and a Stressed version (S4) that\ncan be used to model the lower and upper bound of the range of ECL estimates.\n- These metrics can be used directly to create a lower- and upper-bound estimate for ECL, keeping in mind that metrics\nbased on Baseline scenario data would be applied to the lower bound, while metrics based on the S4 scenario would be\napplied to the upper bound.\n18 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Triangulation indicators\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nTo construct our index’s lower and upper bound for the peer group,17 we first computed the weighted-average ECL for the sample\nbanks in our dataset (1.98%) shown in Figure 25. Then, we computed the weighted average for every ECL metric used in the\nindices per Figure 26. Our lower- and upper-bound index constructed from our set of metrics gives us a lower bound of 1.64% and\nan upper bound of 3.24%, which is intuitively commensurate with the values observed from our sample set. Four banks fall below\nthe lower bound based on the peer group averages: Wells, BofA, Key, and M&T.\nTop 14 banks – allowance for credit loss disclosures\nACL Q1\nTotal amount\nBank name ($MM) Assets size loans ACL Q1 % (3/31)\n1JPM 2,367,127 9 48,881 2.50% 25,400\n2BoA 1,812,976 9 68,579 1.63% 17,126\n3Wells 1,708,548 938,694 1.19% 12,022\n4Citi 1,472,915 659,787 3.14% 22,654\n5USB 477,394 299,090 2.07% 6,590\n6Truist 451,310 305,651 1.78% 5,446\n7PNC 395,783 239,570 1.66% 4,394\n8Fifth Third 169,489 110,591 2.02% 2,236\n9Ally 167,073 124,298 2.54% 3,245\n10CFG 164,652 119,745 1.73% 2,213\n11Key 145,184 95,273 1.28% 1,520\n12Regions 127,543 83,334 1.89% 1,665\n13M&T 125,041 89,681 1.47% 1,380\n14Huntington 108,790 75,893 2.05% 1,603\nWeighted Average ECL 1.98%\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nIn the creation of the index, expert judgment plays a role in both the selection of the metrics as well as the weights assigned to\neach metric.

We decided to assign equal weighting of 30% to the first three and a weight of\n5% to the 3-year averages. The lower-bound estimate now gave us a baseline estimate. To truly make it a lower-bound estimate,\nwe then took 70% of the final value. The 70% is based on ensuring that our lower and upper bound are grounded in credit risk\nobserved behavior (asymmetry of credit risk), which we discuss in the last paragraph of this section.\nFor the upper bound, we focused on 10 stressed metrics that gave us a view of worsening economic conditions as of March 31,\n2020. All 10 metrics provided a similar range of worst-case scenarios ranging from a low of 3.5% to a high of 6.3% for the entire\npeer group. We assigned equal weights of 10% to each metric, which were all based on either Moody’s Analytics S4, the Great\nRecession period, or the DFAST scenario. Just as with the lower bound, to make the metric a realistic upper bound and not a worst-\ncase upper bound, we applied a 70% factor to the index.\nCredit asymmetry behavior depicts that downside credit risk is much larger than upside credit risk. Thus, our lower- and upper-\nbound metrics adhere to the principle. Our average for the sample peer dataset average is 2.35%, with a lower bound at 1.64%\nand an upper bound at 3.24%, simply reflecting that the downside difference (3.24%-2.35%) is much larger than the upside\ndifference (2.35%-1.64%).\n20 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Comparison of results – averages\nNext, we applied these weights for each bank to understand where, based on each bank's individual results, they fell within our\nlower- and upper-bound index. Figure 27 presents each bank-specific upper- and lower-bound index as well as the peer group\nupper- and lower-bound average estimate depicted as the red lines on the graph.\nTriangulation of ACL estimates\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC call report data\nBased on the chosen methodology and weights assigned, we produced a range of estimates for each bank, which seems to be\nreasonable given what we know as of March 31, 2020. The banks that aggressively provisioned seem to be over the lower-bound\nthreshold for the peer group (JPM, Truist, Citi, USB, Ally, Fifth Third, and so on), whereas the banks that were seen as being rather\nless conservative fall at or just below the lower bound for the peer group (Wells, Key, M&T). Figure 28 shows the individual banks’\nupper- and lower-bound thresholds.\nTop 14 banks – upper- and lower-bound bank-specific range estimates\nBank name ACL Q1 % Upper Bound Lower bound\nJPM 2.50% 3.32% 1.65%\nBoA 1.63% 2.56% 1.15%\nWells 1.19% 2.81% 1.23%\nCiti 3.14% 6.10% 3.27%\nUSB 2.07% 2.43% 1.45%\nTruist 1.78% 2.85% 1.13%\nPNC 1.66% 2.33% 0.93%\nFifth Third 2.02% 4.02% 2.58%\nAlly 2.54% 3.83% 1.99%\nCFG 1.73% 3.29% 2.03%\nKey 1.28% 3.20% 1.35%\nRegions 1.89% 3.97% 2.10%\nM&T 1.47% 1.45% 0.72%\nHuntington 2.05% 3.15% 1.41%\nWeighted Averages 1.98% 3.24% 1.64%\nSource: Moody’s Analytics and FDIC call report data\nWe discuss the individual banks’ results in the next section, with added commentary based on the riskiness indicators. The riskiness\ndashboard in Figure 29 outlines the banks that have better than average riskiness metrics. This could help add to our interpretation\nwhether any given bank is more or less reserved as of March 31.\nFor example, BofA sits just below the peer group average lower-bound index, but quite a fair bit above the BofA bank-specific\nindex. BofA performed on average much better in a crisis during the last stress test, having the lowest DFAST riskiness scaler for\n21 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?the entire peer group. Hence, we believe that it is better reserved on average than most of its peers, and indicates that BofA is\nprobably being much more aggressive than its peers in reserving for a lower risk portfolio.\nIn another example, M&T sits below the peer group lower-bound index and yet above its bank-specific upper-bound index due to\nvery low net charge-off experience on which our top-down models are conditioned. However, the DFAST riskiness index tells a\ndifferent story, showing that their portfolio is one of the riskiest in the peer group. We believe that even with the added scaler\nadjustment, M&T should be sufficiently reserved compared to its peer group.\nFigure 29 provides a view of the different riskiness indicators.

There is little doubt that given economic deterioration, banks will be increasing their reserves in Q2. We\nbelieve our upper-bound estimate for Q1 2020 to be a good benchmark for what to expect in Q2 2020.\nJPM\nJPM reserved 2.5% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 30). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.65% and 3.32%, which\nrepresents quite a range in their case. We emphasize that the upper bound is based on a worst-case scenario as of March 31, 2020,\nbut as of April/May became the baseline levels—which means that the reserve level required by JPM could be substantial. In fact,\nJPM already mentioned at its investor conference that the company expects to reserve another ~7 billion for Q2 2020.20 JPM’s\nreserve ratio would rise to about 3.4%, which would put it above the upper bound of 3.32% computed for JPM. Given that the Q2\nscenario is very close to our upper-bound metrics, this is right in line with where JPM plans to be. We view JPM as well reserved as\nof March 31, 2020 and expect an allowance build to get them close to or above our current upper bound in Q2.\nBank-specific triangulation - JPM\nBofA\nBofA reserved 1.63% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 31). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.15% and 2.56%. The Q1\nreserve sits between the midpoint of its upper- and lower-bound estimates. BofA is just below the peer group lower bound at\n1.64%—but looking at the riskiness indicator tells us that with a scaler of 0.78, it means that its portfolio is relatively much less\nrisky than the peer group. Compared to peers, BofA has smaller exposure to credit cards and generally tighter lending standards,\nwhich likely contributes to a lower loan loss reserve than most of its peers. We view BofA as well reserved as of March 31, 2020\nand expect an allowance build to get them closer to our upper-bound in Q2.\n19 The comparisons presented here are those of the authors and do not represent the opinion of Moody’s Corporation.\n20 JP Morgan Investor’s Conference: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jp-morgan-dimon/jpmorgan-ceo-bank-will-again-boost-credit-reserves-in-second-\nquarter-idUSKBN2322RH?il=0\n23 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Bank-specific triangulation - BofA\nWells\nWells reserved 1.19% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 32). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.23% and 2.81%. The Q1\nreserve sits close to its lower-bound estimates. The allowance coverage is smaller and below peers. Wells was one of the only\nmajor banks to reduce its allowance with the adoption of CECL, citing a much different loan mix with less credit card exposure.\nOne of the big factors cited in Wells’s reserves being lower was the higher than expected recoveries forecast that is allowed based\non the new CECL guidance. On the riskiness indicator side, Wells had a slightly better than average DFAST riskiness scaler but is\nquite far below the peer group lower bound average, which sits at 1.64%. Because of the subsequent economic downturn due to\nCOVID-19, the company added $3 billion to the reserves after the Day 1 adoption. According to our triangulation analysis, we view\nWells as under-reserved compared to the peer group as of March 31, 2020. A larger build than their peer group in Q2 will place\nthem in a more reasonable range.\nBank-specific triangulation - Wells\n24 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Citi\nCiti reserved 3.14% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 33). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 3.27% and 6.10%. The Q1\nreserve sits below its lower-bound estimate. The allowance is higher on average than its peers primarily due to higher exposures to\ncredit cards and weakness in commercial real estate. Citi does have the highest level of reserves among the peer group. It sits well\nabove the group’s weighted average of 1.98% and well above the lower-bound average of 1.64%. The DFAST riskiness scaler also\nshows that Citi’s portfolio is relatively less risky than the peer bank average with a scaler of 0.86 based on the fact that its asset\nconcentration lies within portfolios that are less risky than its peers. According to our triangulation analysis, we tend to view Citi as\nwell reserved as of March 31, 2020 but we expect a larger than average build in Q2.\nBank-specific triangulation - Citi\nUSB\nUSB reserved 2.07% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 34). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.45% and 2.43%. The Q1\nreserve sits above its midpoint of the upper- and lower-bound estimates. The provision for loan losses for Q1 was low compared to\npeers but the overall allowance is similar or even higher than peers. On a recent analyst call, USB disclosed:21 “Our expectation is\nthat unemployment is going to be pretty significant in the second quarter and then starting to dissipate or moderate as we go\nthrough the rest of the year and into 2021. So, our expectation is that the reserve builds in the second quarter by the industry as\nwell as USB is going to be pretty significant.” USB’s reserve is above that of the peer group lower-bound threshold and the riskiness\nof its portfolio is just slightly better than the peer group average. Thus, we view it as well reserved for the March 31, 2020\nreporting period. According to our triangulation analysis, we expect that USB will have to build substantially in Q2 toward the\nupper end of the peer group average upper bound of 3.24%.\n21 U.S. Bancorp at Sanford C Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference May 28, 2020.\n25 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Bank-specific triangulation - USB\nTruist\nTruist reserved 1.78% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 35). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.13% and 2.85%. The Q1\nreserve sits between the upper- and lower-bound estimates of its own ECL range but just above the peer group average of 1.64%.\nTruist performed better than average on most riskiness indicators, has historically experienced lower NCO through the Great\nRecession, and has a DFAST riskiness scaler that is just below the peer group average. According to our triangulation analysis, we\nbelieve that it is reserved on par as of March 31, 2020. In Q2, we expect Truist to get closer to the upper bound of its current index\nrange.\nBank-specific triangulation - Truist\n26 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?PNC\nPNC reserved 1.66% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 36). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 0.93% and 2.33%. The Q1\nreserve sits at just above the peer group lower-bound estimate of 1.64%. PNC did experience higher levels of NCOs during the\nGreat Recession but this could be behind it. The company is well above its lower-bound index and its DFAST riskiness scaler\nindicates that PNC with a scaler of 0.84 is a fair bit less risky than the average peer. According to our triangulation analysis, we\nbelieve PNC is adequately reserved for economic conditions as of March 31, 2020. However, we look for more reserve build\nheading into Q2 2020 to get very close to the 2.33% upper bound.\nBank-specific triangulation - PNC\nFifth Third\nFifth Third reserved 2.02% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 37). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 2.58% and 4.02%. The\nQ1 reserve sits well below its lower-bound estimates but well above the peer group lower-bound average. Fifth Third cites strong\ncredit quality in the loan book with high exposure to C&I loans, specifically shared national credits that are more resilient in this\ndownturn. However, based on the DFAST riskiness scaler at 1.18, as well as higher than average NCO during the Great Recession,\nwe would expect Fifth Third to be under-reserved compared to its DFAST peer group. According to our triangulation analysis, we\nview Fifth Third as being less well reserved than the peer group as of March 31, 2020 and expect it will have a larger build than the\npeer group in Q2 based on its riskiness indicators.\n27 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Bank-specific triangulation – Fifth Third\nAlly\nAlly reserved 2.54% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 38). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.99% and 3.83%. The Q1\nreserve sits between its upper- and lower-bound estimates. Ally’s riskiness indicators are well above the peer group, except for the\nfact that it has a very good DFAST coverage ratio. It is the second most well-reserved bank in the peer group. According to our\ntriangulation analysis, we believe Ally is appropriately reserved as of March 31, 2020, but look for more aggressive reserving in Q2\n2020 to get closer to our upper bound as of March 31, 2020.\nBank-specific triangulation - Ally\n28 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?CFG\nCFG reserved 1.73% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 39). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 2.03% and 3.29%. The Q1\nreserve sits below its lower-bound estimates but above the peer group lower-bound average. CFG riskiness indicators are very\nvolatile; it has a much higher than average max NCO but a lower average NCO. This reflects the few quarters of low NCO when\nthe unemployment rate was above 8% during the Great Recession. The DFAST riskiness scaler is slightly worse than the peer\ngroup’s. According to our triangulation analysis, we believe CFG is one of the institutions that will have to do much more reserving\nthan its peers in the coming quarters—but its level of reserves for Q1 is still above our lower bound for the peer group, so we\nconsider CFG well reserved as of March 31, 2020 with the potential to be one of those institutions that produce a larger than\naverage build in Q2.\nBank-specific triangulation - CFG\nKey\nKey reserved 1.28% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 40). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.35% and 3.20%. The Q1\nreserve sits slightly below its lower-bound estimates and well below its peer group lower-bound estimate. Key, like CFG, seems to\nhave done the minimum ramp-up on the reserve side based on both its ECL range and the peer group. We believe Key will need to\nget more aggressive in reserving over the next quarter. Its DFAST riskiness indicator at 0.98 indicates that it ranks as below average\nrisk within the peer group by only a slight margin. Key and Wells are the only two banks that fall below the peer group lower-\nbound estimate. According to our triangulation analysis, we view Key as being well below its peers in reserving for March 31, 2020\nand expect it will have a larger than average build in Q2.\n29 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Bank-specific triangulation - Key\nRegions\nRegions reserved 1.89% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 41). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 2.10% and 3.97%. The Q1\nreserve sits below its lower-bound estimates but above the peer group lower-bound. Regions performs better than its peer group\nover the Great Recession, but the DFAST metrics are showing it as having the riskiest book in the DFAST peer group with a DFAST\nriskiness scaler of 1.28. According to our triangulation analysis, we believe Regions will have to ramp up reserves more aggressively\nthan its peers in Q2 2020 and see it as having adequately reserved for March 31, 2020.\nBank-specific triangulation - Regions\n30 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?M&T\nM&T reserved 1.47% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 42). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 0.72% and 1.45%. The Q1\nreserve sits near its upper-bound estimates. M&T sits well above its lower bound, yet falls below the peer group lower-bound\nindex. It is the one in the peer group that reserves more than its upper-bound index, which is probably due to its low historical loss\nexperience. However, its DFAST riskiness scaler tells us it is one of the riskiest bank peers in the group. According to our\ntriangulation analysis, we believe that M&T is well reserved enough as of March 31, 2020 but we expect some more build for Q2.\nThe key with M&T is the historical experience and whether or not the future looks like the past with a repeat of low levels of\nNCOs.\nBank-specific triangulation – M&T\nHuntington\nHuntington reserved 2.05% of loans for Q1 2020 (Figure 43). Our lower- and upper-bound estimates were 1.41% and 3.15%. The\nQ1 reserve sits near the midpoint of the upper- and lower-bound estimates. Huntington’s DFAST riskiness scaler is very near the\npeer group’s average in all categories. The DFAST exercise tells us the mortgage portfolio is riskier on average than that of the peer\ngroup and could suffer if a second wave of the COVID-19 virus starts affecting that market. According to our triangulation analysis,\nwe believe it is well reserved for Q1 2020, but based on our upper-bound index estimate, it will still need to increase reserves for\nQ2 by a fair amount.\n31 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Bank-specific triangulation - Huntington\nSummary and takeaways\nThe main reason for undertaking this research was to understand whether there was a practical way to produce an upper- and\nlower-bound index that could provide a reasonable indicator of the level of reserves across a set of peer banks. We found evidence\nthat by combining top-down methodologies and riskiness indicators, we can better understand the position in which each\nindividual bank finds itself among its peer group. Based on current developments in the macroeconomic environment, we expect\nmost banks in the peer group analyzed to move much closer to the upper bound in Q2 2020, which has been confirmed by\nanecdotal evidence of statements from JPM and USB.\nThe lower-bound index for the peer group as of March 31, 2020 sits at 1.64% and the upper-bound index for the peer group is\n3.24%. Our expectation based on the research, the banks’ current portfolios, and the evolution of the economic environment is\nthat the lower-bound index will move well above 2% and the upper-bound index will move into the low 4% range, but time will\ntell. Based on our analysis, we expect a few banks in the peer group to ramp up reserve in Q2 more aggressively than the rest—\nnamely Wells, Key, Fifth Third, CFG, and Regions. The latter three have a riskier loss profile than the peer group average and Wells\nrelies perhaps too heavily on its expected recoveries forecast in Q1.\nWe will conduct this research again based on Q2 2020 results and will publish results shortly after the Q2 2020 call report data\nbecomes available to help refine and confirm the weights of the triangulation index developed in this paper.\nThe same methodology can be repeated using portfolio-level call report information to narrow the index range even more and to\nrefine the precision level. In times of rapidly developing and extreme uncertainty, we find that combining heuristics can offer\nmuch-needed reassurance when trying to look for a range of possible outcomes. The tools used in this paper to conduct this type\nof benchmarking are available from Moody’s Analytics. They can give executive management a point of view on the range of\npossible outcomes, especially when internal model reliance is brought into question.\n32 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?Additional resources from Moody’s and Moody’s Analytics\n» Moody’s Topic Page on COVID-19\n» Forecasting the Impact of the COVID-19 Recession on Consumer Credit Losses\n» Moody’s Analytics – CECL And IFRS 9 Recommendations: Handling Shifting Economic Scenarios\n» Moody’s Analytics – Severe Pandemic, a Protracted Economic Slump, and Commercial Real Estate Forecast Scenarios\n» Moody’s Investors Service - Worldwide, Coronavirus Aid Will Benefit Financial Institutions, But Could Raise Long-Term Risks\n33 JUNE 2020 CECL BUILD - IS IT ENOUGH?© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
