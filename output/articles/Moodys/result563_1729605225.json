There are legal distinctions between a lease with an option-to-purchase\nagreement and a lease-to-purchase agreement. The former obligates the seller to sell during the leasing period at the option of the renter, who is not obligated to\npurchase the home. A lease-to-purchase agreement commits both parties to the sale, “barring breach of contract or the buyer’s inability to secure a mortgage.” The\ncompanies we reviewed generally do not formally identify which of the two types of rent-to-own agreements they utilize.\n4 According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the median credit score of newly originated mortgages in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2021 was 786. https://\nwww.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc_2021q2.pdf\n5 The max front-end DTI (inclusive of housing-related expenses) is 31% for the FHA and the maximum back-end DTI (inclusive of all personal debt obligations) is 50%\nfor the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n6 Home Partners provides live rental rates on partner brokerage websites, including Coldwell Banker, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, Century 21, and other select\nbrokerage firms.\n7 Double-digit year-over-year rent growth through June 2022 is evident in nearly all markets across the country.\n8 Credit score is the average credit score of all household members who will contribute to rent, weighted by the amount each household member’s income makes up of\nthe total income of the household.\n9 The numerator is the number of residents within a given acquisition (move-in) year who purchased their home, and the denominator is the number of all residents\nwho exited the program (number who purchased + number who left the program without buying).\n10 Trailing 12-month home values are based on a Zillow indexed value. Population includes homes owned for at least 18 months as of March 31, 2022.\n11 Choice Lease was originally launched on a pilot basis in three test markets in 2019. Following Home Partners’ acquisition by Blackstone in July 2021 as well as the\nmoderation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Choice Lease was formally relaunched in January 2022, at which time it was expanded to 17 markets. Black-\nstone and Home Partners have committed to acquire at least $1 billion in homes through the Choice Lease program over the next two years, with the goal of enabling\n3,000-4,000 low- and moderate-income households to become homeowners.\n12 The Trio program includes a number of features designed to help households achieve sustainable homeownership while also protecting the FHA’s Mutual Mortgage\nInsurance Fund and taxpayers by extension. These include:\nRequirements for pre- and post-closing housing counseling (paid for by Trio);\nCash reserves (posted by Trio);\nMortgage Protection Policy (an insurance product Trio adds to provide gap coverage to FHA and Ginnie Mae investors, paid for at closing, that adds 128%\npayment default coverage);\nHealthy home inspections (every six months);\nHome warranty throughout the lease term;\nHazard policy; and\nRenters policy.\n13 This information was obtained from firsthand interviews of individuals who participated in this program.\n14 See 12 U.S.C.A. § 1709(g).\n15 This is added by this white paper’s authors.\n16 For example, Goodman and Zhu (2021) used past mortgage payments as a proxy for rental payments, estimating that they predict future mortgage performance even\nbetter than credit scores.\nLEASE-TO-PURCHASE: HOW TO BUILD HOMEOWNERSHIP 13Lease-to-Purchase: How to Build Homeownership\n17 Elsewhere on its website, Dream America says if after renting for 12 months the renter decides not to buy the home, they can ask Dream America to sell it. The com-\npany says that if it is able to recoup its costs, earnest money will be returned to the renter after the house is sold.\n18 The purchase price in the right-to-purchase agreement, as set at the time the customer enters into the lease, includes an adjustment equal to $2,500 for what Home\nPartners calls a “Maintenance Adjustment.” If the customer chooses to purchase the home, and the maintenance costs covered by the Maintenance Adjustment\nactually incurred by Home Partners during the lease are less than the Maintenance Adjustment, the purchase price of the home at closing will be reduced by the un-\nused amount of the Maintenance Adjustment.\nLEASE-TO-PURCHASE: HOW TO BUILD HOMEOWNERSHIP 14About the Authors\nMichael Stegman is a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute, a visiting professor at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy,\nand a distinguished professor emeritus and founding chair of the Department of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill.
