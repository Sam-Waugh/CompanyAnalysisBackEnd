Access to industry\nJapan +81.3.5408.4100 data and dynamic dashboards of credit and market performance improves credit risk benchmarking,\nportfolio management, credit loss estimation, and credit risk modeling. This article will focus on three\ndifferent approaches to credit risk benchmarking, which provides context for measuring portfolio\nperformance and brings objectivity to the exercise.\nPortfolio Benchmarking\nPortfolio benchmarking of a financial institution’s historical data provides trend analysis throughout\ntime. For example, portfolio and risk managers can look at their own portfolio for year-over-year\ntrends or before and after a major event, such as an acquisition. Benchmarking your portfolio can help\nyou identify and monitor trends within particular industries, geographies, or product lines to spot\nopportunities for growth or pinpoint areas that can require remedial attention.\nPortfolio Benchmarking: In this graph, a risk manager can observe this portfolio’s risk trend through time and an increase\nin the portfolio’s probability of default (PD), or EDF™ (Expected Default Frequency), in 2015 and 2016. The next step is to\npinpoint the root cause by looking into financial ratio drivers causing the increase in risk. It is also worth looking into specific\nsegments of the portfolio with higher risk exposure.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nPeer Benchmarking\nPeer benchmarking is a critical step to strategic planning for an institution. By comparing your portfolio to\nthat of a peer institution, you gain a broader overview of where you stand on risk metrics, such as probability\nof default (PD), loss given default (LGD) or expected loss (EL). For the comparison to be meaningful, you\nshould benchmark yourself against a comparable peer. For example, a financial institution that operates\nprimarily in the agriculture business or in commercial real estate will want to compare itself to a similar bank\n(roughly the same size, geography, and concentration). When benchmarking internal ratings to an external\nsource, it is best practice to map all ratings to a standard scale.\nPeer Benchmarking: A portfolio is compared with peer portfolios in the Credit Research Database (CRD™), Moody’s Analytics\nproprietary database of private firm financial statements and defaults. This graph shows whether a portfolio aligns with the wider\nindustry experience. A deeper investigation is necessary if an anomaly arises from what is observed in the benchmark data.\nIndustry Benchmarking\nIndustry benchmarking compares a portfolio to a representative portfolio constructed from benchmark data\nbased on borrower characteristics, such as industry, region, or size. This approach provides more in-depth\nknowledge on industry performance, risk sensitivities, and emerging trends to improve commercial credit\nanalysis. Industry benchmark data can be obtained from different industry consortia. The advantage is that\nan external data vendor can aggregate, clean, and normalize data from multiple sources and institutions. This\nconsistency ensures that credit risk metrics being benchmarked are comparable.\nIndustry Benchmarking: The graph above shows the EDF trends of an institution’s Mining, Oil and Gas portfolio compared to indus-\ntry data from Moody’s Analytics Credit Research Database. It is prudent to identify early signals of industry distress by comparing a\nspecific industry, with a broader data set. This timely insight allows risk managers to observe trends, reshape their lending strategy in\ncertain industries or regions, and also reevaluate their investment strategies.\n2 JANUARY 2017 THE POWER OF CREDIT RISK BENCHMARKING: INCORPORATING BENCHMARK DATA INTO PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENTMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nSummary\nThe credit environment is becoming more dynamic and interconnected across global markets and asset\nclasses.
