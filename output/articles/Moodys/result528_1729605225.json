Loss models have\ntraditionally considered two main factors of credit risk: the profile of the borrower—credit\nhistory, leverage, property and loan type—and the economic cycle. Severe weather events brought on by\nclimate change can be considered a third credit risk. Hurricanes, wildfires and floods, among other climate\nevents, have the potential to disrupt household cashflows, increasing the likelihood that borrowers fall\nbehind on their mortgage payments. In addition, severe weather events are destructive and property values\ncan be negatively impacted in the wake of a major incident. Borrowers are sensitive to the value of their\nhome when making payments; there is little financial incentive to pay back a mortgage for a home that has\nbeen destroyed. In addition, lenders closely monitor house prices as declining values reduce their return on\nany defaulted properties that are repossessed and liquidated.\nWhile conceptualizing the impact of severe weather events on mortgage credit risk is straightforward, quantifying\nthe effect for the purposes of risk management is more complicated. This paper outlines an approach for incor-\nporating climate events’ influence on mortgage credit losses in the context of the Moody’s Analytics Mortgage\nPortfolio Analyzer platform, or MPA, which is a loan-level model that forecasts expected loss as the product of\ndefault, prepayment and severity rates. It includes a discussion of the climate data used, the linkage to traditional\nmeasures of mortgage credit risk, and the impact on expected losses for a portfolio of residential mortgages.\nClimate data\nClimate data was sourced from Moody’s RMS, a market leader in climate risk analysis. RMS develops and\nmaintains a host of simulation models across multiple climate events and multiple geographies. For the\ncurrent exercise, the analysis was focused on flood events in Florida over a one-year time horizon. Each\nevent within the simulation set occurs at a specified rate; 50,000 events were considered, with each event\nhaving a 0.002% chance of occurring over a one-year period. Each simulated event includes the total prop-\nerty exposure for that geographic region as well as the resulting damage in dollars for the impacted loca-\ntions. Sample simulation data is presented in Table 1.\nThere are multiple ways events can be sorted; one intuitive approach is to order events by the total amount\nof damage, or loss, caused by a given event. This is a sensible approach in the context of credit loss model-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate impaCt on mortgage Credit losses–a portfolio example 2Table 1: Sample Simulation Data\nEvent ID Loss, $ Value, $ Event ID Loss, $ Value, $\n2876927 70,572,092 564,370,000 2871509 53,863,810 297,630,000\n2848618 69,376,181 470,030,000 2876754 52,825,858 286,290,000\n2859769 64,491,320 550,110,000 2875099 47,493,026 104,850,000\n2860780 58,591,269 517,560,000 2864480 47,387,739 493,610,000\n2858406 58,537,531 549,370,000 2864996 44,708,656 276,850,000\n2864996 44,708,656 276,850,000\nSource: Moody's Analytics\ning, as it is the total magnitude of damages that will impact collateral values. One nuance is that this\nmethod orders events on the absolute level of damage caused; sorting on the relative amount of damage, mea-\nsured as the percentage of losses in relation to the total property exposure, will lead to a different ordering.\nThe most extreme event in the sample data had a total loss of $224.8 million on a pool of properties valued at\n$643 million. This ratio of total losses to total property values can be referred to as the damage ratio; this metric\ncaptures the percentage of property value that is lost, in the present analysis, in the wake of a severe flood event.\nFor the most extreme event in the sample, the damage ratio is 35%. The top 100 most extreme simulated flood\nevents are plotted in Chart 1.\nChart 1: Flood Impact Is Nonlinear\nTop 100 simulated flood events ranked by total loss\n800 48%\n700 42%\n600 36%\n500 30%\n400 24%\n300 18%\n200 12%\n100 6%\n0 0%\nLoss, $ mil (L) Value, $ mil (L) Damage ratio, % (R)\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 1\nWhile the level of losses across events declines in a smooth nonlinear fashion, the relative damage caused\ndecays in a less orderly manner. Several events are more destructive, on a relative basis, than the most\nsevere event in the sample, but the overall dollar loss is more modest.\nFor the purposes of the credit risk application, we can assume that the aggregate loss distribution is well\ndescribed by the annual maximum. This assertion that the annual maximum explains the aggregate loss\ndistribution can be quantified in a rigorous way. In the terminology of catastrophe modeling, the annual\nmaximum loss distribution is called the “occurrence” loss distribution, and its exceedance probability\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate impaCt on mortgage Credit losses–a portfolio example 3function is the OEP. Under a Poisson assumption, and independent frequency and severity, applicable to\nour case of interest, the equation for the OEP is given as:\nOEP(l) = 1 – exp(-EEF(l))\nwhere the loss threshold of interest is l and EEF(l) is what we call the event exceedance frequency evaluated\nat loss threshold l. Clearly, the cumulative probability of the annual maximum loss is:\nOCP(l) = exp(-EEF(l))\nwhich we label as the occurrence cumulative probability. Individual events can be from this cumulative probability\ndistribution. While all events in the sample caused some measure of damage, many were modest and unlikely to\nhave a significant impact on mortgage credit performance. As a result, the analysis focused on the more extreme\nportion of the event distribution, specifically at three thresholds: the 0.01, the 0.1 and the 1 percentile events. Events\nbeyond the 1 percentile were ignored as the level of total losses is immaterial. There were 503 events that fell at or\nbeyond the 1 percentile; the three events selected are plotted in Chart 2.\nChart 2: Selected Events\nOccurrence cumulative probability; X-axis=total event damages, $ mil\n100.2\n0.01th percentile\n0.1th\n100.0 percentile\n99.8\n99.6\n99.4\n99.2\n99.0\n1st percentile\n98.8\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 2\nThe analysis now moves from the event level to the location level. Within each event, there are a set of impacted\nlocations. Each location represents a given property, and similar to the analysis at the event level, each location\nhas an associated loss figure tied to the given flood event and a measure of the structure value. The current\nanalysis included 1,356 total locations for each event, though only a subset of properties experienced non-zero\nlosses in any given event. Table 2 includes descriptive statistics for the selected events.\nSimilar to the analysis performed at the event level, a location-specific damage ratio can be constructed.\nThe ranked damage ratios for the 0.01 percentile event are plotted in Chart 3.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate impaCt on mortgage Credit losses–a portfolio example 4Table 2: Selected Climate Events\nAvg loss on impacted Avg collateral value for\nEvent (percentile) Total locations Impacted locations Share impacted, %\nlocations, $ impacted locations, $\n0.01th 1,356 556 41.0 180,260 126,182\n0.1th 1,356 426 31.4 52,333 36,633\n1st 1,356 308 22.7 11,301 7,911\nSource: Moody's Analytics\nChart 3: Climate Damage Varies at the Location Level\nLocation-level damage ratio, % of structure value lost to extreme climate event, 0.01thpercentile event\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 3\nWhile all properties in a given event are impacted, the shocks are not evenly felt across locations. Many\nlocations realize losses of less than 5%, even under the most impactful events. Further, the share of signifi-\ncantly impacted locations diminishes quickly as the analysis moves from the 0.01 percentile to the 1 per-\ncentile. However, across events, a few locations experience a relatively severe level of damage. Further, this\nshare of significantly impacted locations, as a percentage of the total number of locations, increases as the\nanalysis moves from the 1 percentile to the 0.01 percentile; in the case of the most extreme event, losses\nfor a handful of locations are total.\nThe next step involves translating climate event losses to updated property values via location-specific damage\nratios. Given a damage ratio, the structure value of the post-climate event can be updated based on the percent-\nage of losses expected to occur during that event. An additional consideration is the market value, or the com-\nbination of the structure value and the land value, of any given property. Even if a severe climate event destroys\na structure, in most cases, the land retains value. The ratio of the structure value to the property value is mainly\ndriven by property type—single house versus condos—building age and location. Single houses have higher struc-\nture value relative to condos and the ratio is lower for older buildings. Location is another important factor. In\nhigh-price areas like San Francisco and New York City, land is more valuable and, as such, the ratio is lower. For\nthe current exercise, it is assumed that 70% of the total market value can be ascribed to the structure with the\nremaining 30% assigned to land. As a result, the location-level damage ratios are scaled by a factor of 0.7.\nThe adjusted damage ratios are then applied to the structure value to get an updated post-climate event collat-\neral value. In practice, home insurance policies, whether privately or publicly supported, can cover a substantial\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate impaCt on mortgage Credit losses–a portfolio example 5part of the losses. In this research, it is assumed the losses are not covered by any insurance. The ratio of updated\nand original collateral values is plotted in Chart 4; this represents the percentage change in property values across\nlocations in the immediate aftermath of a severe climate event. Further, this field, the updated post-climate\nevent collateral value, is the mechanism through which climate impacts interact with MPA’s credit loss models.\nChart 4: Most Structure Values Decline in Wake of Climate Event\nUpdated collateral value ratio, % of post-climate event structure relative to original value, 0.01 percentile event\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 4\nUpdated appraisal values in MPA\nThe relationship between severe climate events and property values was established in the prior section.\nTo assess the impact on mortgage credit losses, a set of analyses were run in MPA. The expected loss\nforecasts are conditioned on individual loan characteristics such as the FICO score, loan-to-value ratio,\nproperty and loan type, as well as economic drivers, including the change in house prices, interest rates\nand unemployment.\nA significant risk driver in MPA is a borrower’s updated combined LTV, or CLTV. This field is the sum of first-\nand second-lien obligations relative to the value of the underlying collateral. The “loan” portion of the LTV\nratio is updated over time based on the instrument’s amortization schedule; the “value” portion is updated\nvia the house price forecast for the market where a given loan is located. Updated CLTV is a determinant of\ndefault, prepayment, and loss-given default. Borrowers are cognizant of the equity they have acquired over\nthe life of a loan and this metric factors into their mortgage payment decisions. Lenders also track CLTV, as\nit represents the balance owed and the value of the collateral held against the unpaid principal. Further, the\nimpact of CLTV on borrower behavior is nonlinear. Borrowers tend to prepay at an accelerated rate as CLTV\napproaches zero and default at an accelerated rate as CLTV exceeds various thresholds. These dynamics are\ncaptured explicitly within MPA’s models.\nMPA projects collateral values over time based on local house price forecasts. Individual loans are mapped to\nthe corresponding house price forecasts based on their ZIP Code values. However, updated appraisal values\ncan also be fed into the tool. For the present exercise, the calculated collateral value in the aftermath of a se-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate impaCt on mortgage Credit losses–a portfolio example 6vere climate event—the change in a property’s value after applying a given damage ratio and accounting for\nthe structure versus land-value split—is imported into MPA as an updated appraisal value. The loan’s CLTV will\nbe updated as a result, reflecting the post-climate event credit risk profile.\nImpact on mortgage credit losses\nA set of analyses were run in MPA using the unaltered CLTV values and the updated post-climate event\nCLTV values. Of note, within each portfolio, only a minority of loans experience losses and see a change in CLTV,\nwith the number of impacted locations rising as climate events become more extreme. Further, in order to con-\ntrol for borrower characteristics, each loan was assumed to have the same profile, with the only changes made to\nthe updated CLTV. The synthetic loans analyzed in the present exercise are 30-year fixed-rate first-lien mortgages\nwith a 5.5% interest rate, an LTV of 80, FICO score of 740, and partial income and asset documentation originat-\ned in September 2022. Forecasts were run using the October 2022 baseline forecast over a 30-year horizon with\na date of October 31, 2022. The impact of climate between the two analyses can be measured by comparing the\nclimate-adjusted rate of expected losses to the nonclimate-adjusted rate of expected losses (see Table 3).\nTable 3: Forecast Results\nEvent No climate expected No climate expected Climate expected Climate expected Climate Impacted Portfolio\n(percentile) loss rate, % loss balance, $ loss rate, % loss balance, $ impact ratio locations exposure, $\n0.01th 0.389% 2,845,919 2.038% 14,890,336 5.23 556 730,775,760\n0.1th 0.389% 2,845,919 0.592% 4,324,469 1.52 426 730,775,760\n1st 0.389% 2,845,919 0.399% 2,918,715 1.03 308 730,775,760\nSource: Moody's Analytics\nExpected mortgage credit losses increase across the three simulated climate events. This is not surprising;\nwhile a share of properties within each severe event experienced zero losses, no locations saw an increase\nin value. Further, the impact is substantial for the events at the 0.1 and 0.01 percentiles, where lifetime\nexpected losses, after accounting for the impact of severe climate events, increase by 52% and 423%, respec-\ntively. However, even under the event at the 1 percentile, lifetime expected losses increase by roughly 3%\nwhen climate events are accounted for.\nSignificant variation exists at the location level. A small share of loans within each event experience lower\nlifetime expected loss rates after adjusting for climate; the shock to CLTV causes prepayment rates for these\nloans to rise in the forecast period. However, the majority of impacted locations experience an increase in ex-\npected loss rates when climate is accounted for. Some results are extreme (see Table 4). The loan-level variation\nreflects the granularity of the simulated climate data.\nTable 4: Loss Comparison for a Single Loan\nPost-climate\nExpected Prepayment Default Severity Balance on Expected loss Origination Updated\nScenario Loan ID event property\nloss rate, % rate, % rate, % rate, % as-of date balance, $ CLTV CLTV\nvalue, $\nClimate FL_53826 25.02% 31.51% 45% 55% 4,378,000 1,095,241 1,675,536 80.00 261.29\nNo climateFL_53826 0.13% 46.79% 14% 1% 4,378,000 5,640 5,500,000 80.00 79.68\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate impaCt on mortgage Credit losses–a portfolio example 7Conclusion\nSevere climate events impact mortgage credit performance. This can be observed in the historical data. Further,\nregulators have begun to emphasize the need for quantifying climate risk across financial institutions. The process\noutlined in this paper is a reasonable approach for quantifying the impact of severe climate on residential mort-\ngage performance. While the current exercise focused on flood events in Florida, the approach can be extended\nto include other regions and climate events like wildfires, hurricanes and earthquakes. The research can be\nextended by including home insurances that alleviate losses.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate impaCt on mortgage Credit losses–a portfolio example 8About the Authors\nKyle Hillman is an economist with the Business Analytics group of Moody’s Analytics in West Chester PA.
