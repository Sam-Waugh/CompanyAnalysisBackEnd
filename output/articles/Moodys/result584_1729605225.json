Two years after the pandemic first struck, much of the world has\nrecovered the output and employment lost during the severe recession suffered at the start\nof the pandemic and is well on the way to returning to full employment. This strong performance\nis due in significant part to the vaccines and other therapies rapidly developed to fight the virus,\nbut also to the quick and massive global monetary and fiscal policy response.\nIn this paper, we focus on the contribution of the global fiscal policy response to the pandemic. We\nuse the Moody’s Analytics Global Macroeconomic Model to construct a counterfactual scenario in\nwhich governments in the world’s 10 largest economies—accounting for more than two-thirds of\nglobal GDP—do not provide economic support to households and businesses during the pandemic\n(see Chart 1). We compare this counterfactual scenario to our baseline, most likely, scenario, which\nincludes the macroeconomic impact of fiscal policies implemented by governments.\nChart 1: Governments Step Up\nFiscal support during COVID-19 pandemic, % of 2019 GDP\nU.S.\nU.K.\nCanada\nGermany\nItaly\nJapan\nFrance\nBrazil\nChina\nIndia\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 1\nThe macroeconomic consequences of governments failing to help their economies during the\npandemic would have been devastating. Global real GDP would have fallen twice as much in\n2020, and while the economy would have begun to recover in 2021, growth would have been half\nof what it actually was (see Chart 2). There would have been 40 million additional unemployed\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 2workers in 2021 and stubbornly high joblessness thereafter (see Chart 3). And the global economy\nwould forever be diminished, never fully recovering the output lost during the pandemic.1\nChart 2: Deeper Fall, Weaker Recovery\nGlobal real GDP, 2012$ tril, SAAR\n100\nBaseline forecast\n95 Counterfactual scenario\n90\n85\n80\n75\n19 20 21 22 23 24\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 2\nChart 3: Severe Contractions Everywhere\nPeak impact on real GDP, %\nN/A\n<-10\n-10 to <-7\n-7 to <-5\n-5 to <-3\nWorld avg=-7.4\n-3 to <0\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 3\nWhat if?\nThe counterfactual scenario we have constructed assumes national governments never imple-\nmented the emergency discretionary fiscal measures they have actually put in place since the\npandemic hit at the start of 2020. This includes a wide range of policies that broadly encompass\n1 This is known as hysteresis, which is a reduction in the economy’s potential due to a significant economic shock such as a pandemic. This occurs\nbecause of the large number of business failures and bankruptcies, permanent job loss, credit problems, and reduced mobility of labor and capi-\ntal. Once hysteresis sets in, it is difficult to reverse. Hysteresis effects are built into the Moody’s Analytics model of the global economy.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 3transfer payments to households and businesses, tax cuts, aid to subnational governments, and\npublic infrastructure and other direct spending.\nTo quantify this counterfactual scenario, we have simulated the Moody’s Analytics Global Mac-\nroeconomic Model.2 The model links more than 70 countries through international trade, global\nfinancial markets, exchange rates, consumer sentiment, and capital flows. The model is simulated\nassuming an absence of fiscal support for each country by itself, and for all 10 countries at once.\nBy so doing, we are able to determine the spillover effects from one country’s policies on the rest\nof the world. Nearly half the countries benefited more from fiscal support provided by other coun-\ntries than they did from their own fiscal support (see Chart 4).\nChart 4: Fiscal Policy Knows No Borders\nCumulative real GDP impact, % of GDP, 2020-2024\nU.S.\nBrazil\nCanada\nU.K.\nGermany\nChina\nItaly\nJapan\nDomestic fiscal support\nFrance\nExternal fiscal support\nIndia\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 4\nWe make several simplifying assumptions in these simulations. First, we assume the course of the\npandemic and the development and rollout of vaccines proceeded as they did. Second, monetary\npolicy is determined endogenously in the model. That is, global central banks set interest rate and\nbalance sheet policies based on their reaction functions that account for the economy’s perfor-\nmance, inflation, inflation expectations, and financial conditions.3 Finally, we restrict the scope of\nfiscal measures to include only those that explicitly address the fallout from the pandemic.4\nUnited States\nNo other nation responded more aggressively to the pandemic than the U.S. (see Table 1). In total,\nthe fiscal support was well over $5 trillion, equal to nearly 25% of GDP. This compares with less\n2 This analysis is based on the February 2022 vintage of the Moody’s Analytics global macroeconomic forecasts.\n3 A central bank’s reaction function is the estimated historical relationship between the bank’s monetary policy and the economic, financial and\nother variables that monetary authorities use to set monetary policy.\n4 Fiscal legislation that broadly seeks to invest in an economy’s long-run potential was excluded. Some examples are the Build Back Better agenda\nin the U.S. and the Recovery and Resilience Facility in Europe. We even left out a handful of measures from pandemic-era legislation in Japan\nthat were not explicitly tied to the virus. Additionally, our analysis includes only fiscal measures that have a direct impact on budget deficits.\nLiquidity supports, which were substantial in many countries, for example, were excluded.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 4Table 1: U.S. Fiscal Response to COVID-19\nLegislation Actions $ bil\nCoronavirus Preparedness and Response Funding for healthcare agencies and testing, funding for vaccine and other therapies across various 8.3\nSupplemental Appropriations Act agencies, subsidized SME loans.\nFamilies First Coronavirus Response Act Tax credits to firms for COVID-19-related paid sick leave and paid family medical leave; food assis- 192.0\ntance via Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program\nfor Women, Infants, and Children; federal assistance for increased state unemployment insurance\nbenefits; expand Medicare and Medicaid coverage to COVID-19 tests.\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Household cash transfers, federal assistance to expand state unemployment insurance benefits, 1,756.0\nSecurity Act grant-convertible loans to SMEs under the Paycheck Protection Program, grants to states and munic-\nipalities via $150 bil Coronavirus Relief Fund, student loan deferrals, expand Medicaid coverage to\ntelehealth services, various tax deferrals and credits.\nPaycheck Protection Program and Health Addition of $320 bil to Paycheck Protection Program, loans to smaller financial institutions, grants 484.0\nCare Enhancement Act for hospitals, additional funding for states/municipalities for COVID-19 testing.\nPresident Trump’s Executive Orders Extension of plus-up to federal unemployment insurance benefits amounting to $300 per week, with 174.0\nan additional $100 to be provided by states.

The pandemic slammed the U.S.\nin February 2020, the massive CARES Act was passed into law in late March, and no more than one\nmonth later over $1 trillion in fiscal support was already disbursed to households and businesses.\n5 N.

The economy would have also\nsuccumbed to a double-dip recession in early 2021 (see Chart 6). A recovery begins in earnest in\nthe second half of 2021, but even then, the economy never fully returns to its pre-pandemic path,\nas real GDP is permanently reduced.\nChart 6: Double-Dip Recession in the U.S.\nU.S. real GDP, 2012$ tril, SAAR\n22\nBaseline forecast\n21\nCounterfactual scenario\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n19 20 21 22 23 24\nSources: BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 6\nThe impact on the U.S. job market would have been equally grim. The economy is currently on track\nto recoup all the jobs lost during the pandemic recession by late this year. Without government\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 6support, this milestone would not have been achieved until summer 2026. Low-wage workers, who\nhave suffered most financially during the pandemic, would have been set back even further, since\nthey work in industries that have desperately needed government support during the pandemic.\nThis includes administrative and support services, healthcare, retail trade, and leisure and hospi-\ntality (see Chart 7). The weaker job market means that unemployment remains stuck in the double\ndigits through 2021, declines only slowly thereafter, and ultimately never returns to its pre-pan-\ndemic full-employment unemployment rate (see Chart 8).8 Moreover, with the economy operating\nwith high unemployment for an extended period, wage growth sharply slows to an all-time low.9\nChart 7: Low-Wage Industries Most Hurt\nU.S., jobs lost without government support, mil, 2021\nAdmin. & support & waste srvcs $48K\nHealthcare $56K\nConstruction $69K\nRetail trade $38K\nManufacturing $74K\nLeisure & hospitality $28K\nProf., scientific & technical srvcs $109K\nState & local government $58K\nFinancial activities $108K\nTransportation & warehousing $59K\nWholesale trade $86K\nOther services $54K\nEducation $50K\n-2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0\nSources: BEA, BLS, Moody’s Analytics Note: Figures are avg industry wage in 2020.

However, it falls back be-\nlow the Federal Reserve’s inflation target by the second half of 2022. The Fed is not struggling with\nuncomfortably high inflation as it is now. Rather, it contends with uncomfortably low inflation, as\nin the decade after the financial crisis (see Chart 9).\nChart 9: Return of Too-Low Inflation\nU.S. core PCE deflator, % change yr ago\n5\n4\n3\n2\nBaseline forecast\n1\nCounterfactual scenario\nFederal Reserve's target\n0\n19 20 21 22 23 24\nSources: BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 9\nHousehold finances have benefited enormously from government support. Thanks mostly to stim-\nulus checks, enhanced unemployment insurance, and rental and food assistance, personal incomes\ndeclined only briefly at the very start of the pandemic (see Chart 10). If households had not re-\nceived this help, real disposable income would have plunged in 2020 and would not fully recover\nuntil summer 2023.\nChart 10: Household Incomes Get Boost\nU.S. personal income, $ tril, SAAR, change from 2019Q4\n5\nRental and interest income Dividend income\nProprietors' income Labor income\n4\nAdvance Child Tax Credit Enhanced UI benefits\nStimulus checks Net effect\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n20Q1 20Q2 20Q3 20Q4 21Q1 21Q2 21Q3 21Q4\nSources: BEA, U.S. Treasury, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 10\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 8Household wealth would also have been significantly diminished, as the Standard & Poor’s 500\nstock price index would have plunged, cut in half peak to trough (see Chart 11).

The ARP has been criticized as being too\nlarge, overstimulating an already fast-improving economy and significantly contributing to the\ncurrently uncomfortably high inflation.\nThis perspective is not consistent with our results. Without the ARP, the U.S. economy would have\ncome close to suffering a double-digit recession in spring 2021. Based on a simulation of our mac-\nro model assuming no ARP, real GDP declines in the second quarter of 2021 and ekes out only a\nsmall gain in the third (see Table 2). Because of the weakened economy, unemployment rises back\nover 7% in summer 2021 and remains materially higher after that (see Chart 12).10\nThe ARP is responsible for adding well over 4 million more jobs in 2021, and the economy is cur-\nrently on track to recovering all the jobs lost in the pandemic by the second quarter of this year.\nIf there had been no ARP, it would have taken another year for the economy to recover all of\nthese jobs.\nThe ARP has contributed to the acceleration in inflation by supporting increased consumer de-\nmand, but this occurred almost entirely in the first half of 2021 when higher inflation was not\nconsidered a problem (see Chart 13). Indeed, at the time it was even viewed positively, as many\nbusinesses were simply re-establishing the prices they had previously cut when the pandemic\n10 Because of the much weaker economy, the Fed keeps the federal funds rate target at the zero lower bound and engages in quantitative easing\nthrough the end of 2022.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 9Chart 12: More Unemployment Without ARP\nU.S. unemployment rate, %, SA\n13\nBaseline forecast\n11\nNo American Rescue Plan\n9\n7\n5\nFull employment\n3\n19 20 21 22 23 24\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 12\nChart 13: Don’t Blame ARP For High Inflation\nConsumer price inflation, annualized % change\n12\n10\n8 Federal Reserve Target\n6\nOmicron\n4 Wave\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\nPandemic Vaccine ARP Delta\n-6\nRecession Rollout Wave\n-8\n-10\n2019 2020 2021 2022\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 13\ncaused the economy to shut down. Moreover, inflation had been much too low for comfort since\nthe global financial crisis more than a decade earlier. The Federal Reserve and other global central\nbanks had been struggling to lift inflation back up to their targets.\nInflation only became uncomfortably high when the Delta wave of the pandemic hit in late sum-\nmer last year. This inflation was a surprise, but so too was the Delta variant, as it came immediate-\nly on the heels of the vaccine rollout and widespread optimism that the pandemic was more-or-\nless behind us.\nDelta slammed consumer demand, as it prompted renewed self-quarantining and border restric-\ntions, which by itself would moderate inflation, but it also severely disrupted supply.

This is largely why so many open posi-\ntions have gone unfilled, particularly for lower-wage jobs in industries where workers are in close\ncontact with their patrons, such as retailing, restaurants, healthcare and education and childcare\nservices. Wage growth has sharply accelerated, as employers struggled to keep their businesses\nstaffed, especially for these type of jobs. The Omicron wave further complicated efforts to get\nworkers back on the job, as in January at the peak of that wave, some 12 million people told Cen-\nsus they weren’t working because of the virus.\nAlthough the ARP was costly to U.S. taxpayers, without it, the ultimate cost to. them would have\nbeen equally as large. Because of the weaker economy and automatic fiscal stabilizers, tax reve-\nnues would have been lower and government outlays higher. By the end of this decade, the na-\ntion’s debt burden would have been as large as it will end up being with the ARP (see Chart 14).\nChart 14: Debt Burdens As Heavy Without ARP\nU.S. public debt outstanding, % of GDP, fiscal year\n110\nBaseline forecast\n90\nNo American Rescue Plan\n70\n50\n30\n00 04 08 12 16 20 24 28\nSources: BEA, U.S. Treasury, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 14\nCanada and Mexico\nCanada’s and Mexico’s economies have benefited enormously from the massive fiscal support\nprovided by the U.S. The Canadian and Mexican economies are closely linked to the U.S. economy\nthrough trade, investment and immigration flows. These links are particularly important for the\nNorth American vehicle industry, because autos dominate trade between the U.S. and the rest of\nthe continent. Without the fiscal support provided in the U.S., nearly 6 million fewer new vehicles\nwould have been sold in the U.S. in 2021, which, combined with an overall reduction in U.S. goods\nconsumption, would have slammed the Canadian and Mexican economies.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 12Without pandemic-related fiscal support in the U.S., real GDP in 2021 would have been 8% lower\nin Mexico and 6% lower in Canada (see Chart 15).\nChart 15: Spillovers From U.S. Fiscal Policy\nReal GDP, 2019Q4=100\n110 110\nMexico\nCanada\n105\n105\n100\n100\n95\n95\n90\n90\nBaseline forecast 85 Baseline forecast\nNo U.S. fiscal support No U.S. fiscal support\n85 80\n19 20 21 22 23 24 19 20 21 22 23 24\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 15\nAdvanced economies\nGovernments in other advanced economies have also marshaled substantial fiscal support in re-\nsponse to the pandemic (see Table 3). Job retention schemes have been an especially favored poli-\ncy. These schemes helped cover the wages paid to workers who, instead of being laid off, were put\non furlough or had their hours cut. Germany, France, Italy and Japan already had short-time work\nschemes but either increased eligibility or boosted the generosity of benefits, or did both. The pan-\ndemic spurred the U.K. government to stand up a new scheme, while Canadian policymakers intro-\nduced a new wage subsidy covering a fixed percentage of wages regardless of hours not worked.\nThese job retention schemes not only maintained incomes and supported consumer demand but\nalso significantly limited the rise in unemployment. With the exception of Canada, jobless rates\nincreased meaningfully less in these advanced economies than in the U.S., where expanded unem-\nployment insurance benefits were the primary mechanism to support beleaguered workers.11\nKeeping more workers on payrolls also ensured fewer difficulties getting people back to work as\neconomies reopened, limiting disruptive labor shortages and the resulting wage and price pres-\nsures. Though inflation has increased substantially in most advanced economies, this helps explain\nwhy it has been less than in the U.S.\nAdvanced economies also did not hold back in buttressing household incomes via other social\nsafety net programs. Most notably, the Japanese government issued cash payments to residents\nand an extra child allowance.\n11 U.S. small businesses, those with 500 or fewer employees, did receive grants to maintain their payrolls through the Paycheck Protection Program.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 13Table 3: Fiscal Response to COVID-19 in Other Advanced Economies\nEuro Zone Provisions USD bil\nGermany Supports for firms and workers (STW benefits, grands, transfers, etc.) 283.5\nSupports for public agencies and services 143.1\nTax cuts and deferrals 63.7\nPublic investment 15.9\nGermany total 506.2\nFrance Supports for firms and workers (STW benefits, grands, transfers, etc.) 117.6\nPublic investment 87.2\nTax cuts and deferrals 30.1\nFrance total 234.9\nItaly Supports for firms and workers (STW benefits, grants, transfers, etc.) 142.1\nTax cuts and deferrals 32.5\nPublic investment 24.6\nSupports for public agencies and services 16.8\nItaly total 216.0\nJapan Provisions USD bil\nCash payment of ¥100K to Japanese residents and extra child allowance of ¥10K per child 138.5\nEmployment adjustment subsidies 97.4\nContainment measures for COVID-19 51.7\nRevitalization to cope with COVID-19 and other business supports 42.3\nSupport affected sectors in the form of discounts and vouchers 30.5\nSupporting medical treatment providers 27.6\nMeasures to prevent the spread, build out medical treatment, and develop pharmaceuticals 23.1\nCash payments to SMEs and sole proprietors 21.2\nEstablishing rent support grant for SMEs 18.7\nAdditional payments to low-income single parent households 1.3\nDeferred taxes and social security contributions and easing of property taxes for SMEs -0.0\nJapan total 452.2\nU.K. Provisions USD bil\nFunding for National Health Service 207.9\nCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme 101.7\nSelf-Employment Income Support Scheme 37.0\nAdditional transfers to devolved administrations 35.2\nDirect grants to small businesses in most affected sectors 25.2\nProperty tax (business rate) holiday for firms in affected sectors 24.2\nExpanded Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit Schemes 13.4\nVAT reduced at 5% for hospitality, accommodation, and attractions until the end of Sep 2021, at 12.5% until Mar 2022 9.6\nTemporary cut on stamp duty land tax until June 2021 6.6\nFuel Duty: one year freeze in 2021-22 5.6\nRent support by increasing the Local Housing Allowance 5.6\nPublic sector and social housing decarbonization and Green Homes Grant 5.3\nBring forward public infrastructure spending to FY2020/21 5.3\nBoost of active labour market policies 3.8\nWaiver of VAT and customs duties on critical medical imports 2.9\nSupport for culture, charities and sport 2.9\nFunding to cover the National Minimum Wage for 25 hrs a wk for 6 mos 2.7\nAlcohol Duty: one year freeze in 2021-22 2.1\nDeferral of VAT for 2020Q2 until June 21 2.0\nEat Out to Help Out 1.1\nDeferral of income tax (self-assessment) of the self-employed until the end of January 2021 0.9\nExtension the window for starting deferred payments through the VAT New Payment Scheme by up to 3 mos 0.6\nFunding of 40,000 traineeships and 27,000 job coaches 0.6\nStatutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme 0.5\nU.K. total 502.7\nCanada Provisions USD bil\nCanada Emergency Wage Subsidy 76.9\nCanada Emergency Response Benefit 64.0\nSupport to Health System 46.5\nCanada Recovery Benefits 17.7\nCanada Emergency Business Account 11.2\nEnhancements to Employment Insurance 7.9\nEnhanced GST Credit 4.3\nCanada Emergency Rent Subsidy and Lockdown Support 3.4\nOther Measures to Support Vulnerable Canadians (Transfers) 2.9\nOther Direct Support Measures 2.8\nCanada Emergency Student Benefit 2.3\nWage Top-Up for Essential Workers 2.3\nIncome Tax, Sales Tax, and Customs Duty Payment Deferrals 2.3\nOther Support for Businesses (Direct Govt Outlays) 2.0\nOther Support for Businesses (Transfers) 2.0\n10% Temporary Wage Subsidy 1.9\nOne-Time Payment for Seniors Eligible for OAS and GIS 1.9\nCanada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for Small Business 1.6\nEnhanced Canada Child Benefit 1.5\nRegional Relief and Recovery Fund 1.1\nAir Sector 1.0\nOther Measures to Support Vulnerable Canadians (Direct Govt Outlays) 0.8\nSupport for Persons with Disabilities 0.7\nSupporting Community Service Organizations 0.6\nSupport for Innovative Businesses 0.5\nSupport for Workers in the Live Events and Arts Sectors 0.2\nCanada total 260.4\nSources: Bundesministerium der Finanzen, Department of Finance Canada, HM Treasury, IMF, Kantei, Ministère de l’Économie et des Finances, Ministero dell’economia e delle Finanze, Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 14Some advanced economies were somewhat hampered by budget constraints in providing support.\nItaly, for example, had less fiscal space for direct spending and therefore relied more heavily on\nloan guarantees. The EU was able to work around budgetary constraints through joint stimulus\nmeasures that were funded by mutualized debt obligations. Our analysis does not include the im-\npact of Europe’s Recovery and Resilience Facility, but these plans supported market confidence,\nwhich in turn kept interest rates low and allowed countries to spend more than would have other-\nwise been the case.\nAdvanced economies also benefited from fiscal support in other countries. In Europe, these spill-\nover effects were most evident in Germany, where the country’s fiscal measures were not much\ngreater, as a share of GDP, than those in France and Italy. German exports, particularly of vehicles,\nhave been significantly buoyed by global demand that would have been substantially diminished\nwithout the fiscal help provided around the world (see Chart 16).\nChart 16: German Exports Are Crushed\nReal German exports, 2015€ bil, SAAR\n1,700\n1,600\n1,500\n1,400\n1,300\nBaseline forecast\n1,200\nCounterfactual scenario\n1,100\n19 20 21 22 23 24\nSources: Destatis, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 16\nThe fiscal support has also helped Japan avoid a much more serious bout of deflation. Like the U.S.\ndollar, the Japanese yen is a safe-haven currency that generally appreciates when global investors\nare nervous. In the counterfactual scenario without government support, investors are substantial-\nly more skittish and thus flock to the yen, pushing up its value by over 10% on a trade-weighted\nbasis. This puts severe downward pressure on Japanese prices (see Chart 17).\nEmerging markets\nEmerging markets have been hit hard by successive waves of the virus, and a world without fiscal\nstimulus would have been far less kind. Although the three largest emerging economies—China,\nIndia and Brazil—traced different paths with respect to the magnitude and composition of fiscal\nsupport, the consequences of not providing fiscal support are similarly clear: weaker economic re-\ncoveries, higher unemployment, and diminished long-run growth (see Table 4).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 15Chart 17: Deflation for Longer in Japan\nJapanese consumer price index, % change yr ago\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\nBaseline forecast\n-1.0\nCounterfactual scenario\n-1.5\n-2.0\n-2.5\n19 20 21 22 23 24\nSources: Japan Statistics Bureau, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 17\nTable 4: Fiscal Response to COVID-19 in Emerging Markets\nChina Provisions USD bil\nSupport for employment, incomes, reductions in taxes and fees for small businesses 299.7\nInfrastructure spending 239.7\nExemptions from social insurance payments, reduction or exemption of value-added tax 74.9\nWaiving of toll roads, reduction in commerical electricity tariffs 50.5\nChina total 664.8\nIndia Provisions USD bil\nFood aid and cooking gas 30.8\nFertilizer subsidy 10.8\nFinancial assistance for construction workers 4.3\nCash transfers to female heads of household 4.1\nIncrease in cash transfers for rural households 3.7\nInfrastructure investment 3.4\nAdditional spending on public health 3.1\nTravel and consumption vouchers 2.6\nSubsidies for construction industry 2.4\nAdvance payments to farmers 2.4\nJob support for rural economy 1.4\nSupplemental health insurance for hospital workers exposed to COVID-19 1.3\nCash transfers to senior citizens 0.4\nPayroll support program 0.3\nResearch and development funding for vaccine 0.1\nIndia total 71.0\nBrazil Provisions USD bil\nEmergency family income 67.1\nAid for state and local governments 14.8\nAdditional spending on public health 13.0\nPayroll support program 9.1\nVaccine procurement 4.6\nCredits for machinery and equipment 0.9\nAid to tourism industry 0.7\nAid to energy sector 0.2\nExpansion of Bolsa Familia 0.1\nBrazil total 110.4\nSources: Government of India’s Ministry of Finance, National People’s Congress, Tesouro Nacional, Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 16For China, the severe hit to global trade in the counterfactual scenario precipitates a double-dip\nrecession, with the economy contracting again in the first half of 2021. The subsequent economic\nrecovery is also materially slower. Global trade is a critical driver of China’s recovery, and with less\ntrade, the Chinese economy would have stumbled well into 2021.\nThough Chinese officials spent less on direct fiscal support than they did during the global finan-\ncial crisis, the timing and composition of spending were critical. Most of the support was delivered\nin the third quarter of 2020, when the recovery in global trade was nascent. While a large share\nof spending went toward infrastructure, almost half of the support was directed toward relief for\nconsumers and businesses in a departure from China’s traditional infrastructure-heavy playbook.\nWithout this boost, the economic recovery would have been cut short.\nAs in the rest of Latin America, the pandemic ripped through Brazil. But Brazil spent more on direct\nfiscal support to its economy than almost any other emerging economy. Without this support,\npublic health and economic outcomes would have been substantially worse. The Brazilian econo-\nmy would have fallen back into recession in the first half of 2021 and would not have recouped its\npre-pandemic peak until the second half of 2024.\nIndia’s economy benefits the least from fiscal support, since overall government spending was\nlimited. Even with the extension of cash transfer programs during the Delta wave of the pan-\ndemic, which hit India especially hard, cumulative spending in the past two years was just over\n2% of GDP. Global fiscal support also played a role in India’s recovery, though to a lesser extent\nthan in China and Brazil. This is because India’s economy is less reliant on trade overall and global\nfiscal policy was more effective at reviving trade in goods than in services, for which India has a\ncomparative advantage.\nConclusion\nThe massive global fiscal policy response to the pandemic deserves significant credit for limiting\nthe severity and length of the recession that occurred when the pandemic struck, and for the sub-\nsequently strong global economic recovery (see Table 5).\nThere has been criticism of global policymakers for going overboard on the fiscal support, with crit-\nics pointing to recent concerns over high inflation and bigger government deficits and debt loads.\nBut as we show, even without the fiscal support, inflation would still be a worry. Not because in-\nflation would have been too high, but too low—as it had been since the financial crisis. Many glob-\nal central banks would have nervously watched as their economies flirted with or suffered outright\ndeflation in 2020. Though global inflation would have picked up in 2021 because of base effects of\nprices being depressed a year earlier, its rebound would have been slower.\nFurther, the fiscal situation of most countries already would have been even worse if they had not\nprovided the fiscal support, as their much-weakened economies would have caused tax revenues\nto plummet and government expenditures to automatically increase (see Chart 18). The case is the\nsame for the U.S., although it will take a bit longer for this to become clear.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 17Chart 18: More Debt Was Unavoidable\nDebt-to-GDP ratio, ppt increase from 2019Q4 to 2021Q4\nBrazil\nChina Baseline forecast\nGermany Counterfactual scenario\nIndia\nItaly\nFrance\nCanada\nU.K.\nU.S.\nJapan\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 18\nThus, second-guessing the aggressive fiscal policy response of governments to the pandemic is\nmisplaced. Governments had no choice but to act quickly and massively. Perhaps some of the\nspecific policy steps taken during the crisis could have been better designed, at least in hindsight.\nHowever, policymakers’ decisiveness in pushing forward with substantial government support has\nbeen an economic game changer.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic 18MOODY’S ANALYTICS Global Fiscal Policy in the Pandemic
