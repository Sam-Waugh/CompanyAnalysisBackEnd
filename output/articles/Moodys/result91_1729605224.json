PCAF has already developed a widely adopted standard for\nclientservices.emea@moodys.com financed emissions (emissions associated with lending and investments)1. They\nAsia (Excluding Japan) have since set up an Insurance-Associated Emissions Working Group to develop\n+85.2.2916.1121 equivalent standards for emissions associated with underwriting. The first PCAF\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com\nInsurance-Associated Emissions Standard2 follows a period of public consultation\nJapan where feedback was sought on various methodology options proposed by the\n+81.3.5408.4100\nWorking Group3.\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com\nMany insurance companies have acknowledged the urgent need to account for\nunderwriting activities in the transition to net-zero. A growing number are joining\nthe Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA); a group of insurers who have made the\ncommitment to transition their underwriting portfolios to net-zero GHG\nemissions by 2050. The NZIA was formed in July 2021 by eight large European\ninsurance groups: AXA, Allianz, Aviva, Generali, Munich Re, SCOR, Swiss Re, and\nZurich Insurance Group. It has grown rapidly since, with 29 members (at\nNovember 2022) and increasing diversity in company location and size. The NZIA\nset itself an ambitious objective to publish a target-setting protocol by January\n2023, with members committed to individually making intermediate targets\npublic within six months of that date. Version 1.0 of the NZIA’s Target-Setting\nProtocol was published on 31 October 2022 for a period of public consultation.\nOn emissions accounting, this document specifies that “NZIA members shall use\na recognized and consistent IAE accounting approach (e.g. PCAF Insurance-\nAssociated Emissions Standard) for setting and tracking progress towards their\ntargets.”4 The publication of the PCAF IAE Standard thus represents a key\nmilestone in meeting insurers’ broader efforts to set emissions targets and\ntransition their underwriting portfolios to net-zero.\n1 The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, PCAF (2020)\n2 The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard Part C: Insurance Associated Emissions, First Version, PCAF (November 2022)\n3 Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Insurance Industry, Progress Report for Consultation, PCAF (14 July 2022).\n4 Net-Zero Insurance Alliance Target-Setting Protocol, Version 1.0 for public consultation, UNEP FI Principles for Sustainable Insurance (2022).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INSURANCE-ASSOCIATED GHG EMISSIONS: THE PCAF MEASUREMENT STANDARD 1PCAF measurement methodology: Commercial insurance\nThe initial PCAF IAE Standard covers two lines of business: personal motor lines, and commercial lines. In each case, the\ninsurance-associated emissions for a specific insurance policy are calculated by taking the total emissions of the insured\ncustomer or asset, and multiplying by an ‘attribution factor’. The attribution factor reflects the proportion of emissions\nassociated with the insurance cover provided.\nIn particular, for commercial insurance, the IAEs for an individual policy are calculated as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\nEmissions of the insured entity should cover Scope 1 and 2 emissions at a minimum. Where their Scope 3 emissions data is\navailable and reliable, this should be reported separately.\nThis choice of attribution factor depends on two sources of data: the insured entity’s financial data (revenue) and the insurer’s\ninternal data (premiums). This contrasts with an alternative method considered in the progress report for consultation, where\nthe attribution factor depended only on the insurer’s internal data. The final choice of attribution factor shown in Figure 1\nmeans that revenue data, in addition to emissions data, will need to be sourced either directly from the insured entity or via\nthird party data providers.\nThis choice of attribution factor also means that revenue is a source of volatility in IAEs that must be considered when\nanalyzing movements over time. With this choice of attribution factor, movements in IAEs may occur not only due to changes\nin the underlying entity’s emissions, but also in their revenues, and changes in premiums due to insurance market cycles.\nGiven the numerous potential sources of change, insurers will need to interpret IAE dynamics with care.\nIn addition to commercial lines, similar formulae are defined for personal motor lines. Further lines of business may be added\nin future iterations of the standard.\nNote that IAEs are a distinct category of an insurers’ Scope 3 emissions, separate from financed emissions. PCAF highlight that\nInsurance-Associated Emissions and financed emissions are not directly comparable, should be reported separately, and\nshould not be aggregated.\nChallenges and opportunities\nOne of the major challenges in calculating IAEs will be the collection and management of emissions data. Availability,\ncompleteness, reliability, and timeliness of emissions data are recognized challenges with other sources of Scope 3 emissions\nincluding investments. However, these challenges are likely to be acute for the emissions associated with the underwriting\nportfolio. Company emissions data is often challenging to obtain; particularly for the Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises\n(SMEs), who typically make up a large proportion of commercial insurance portfolios. PCAF has acknowledged this lack of\nreported data, and in such cases estimates or proxies may be required. There is an expectation that data quality scores are\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INSURANCE-ASSOCIATED GHG EMISSIONS: THE PCAF MEASUREMENT STANDARD 2calculated and reported alongside emissions, with PCAF defining scores on a 1-5 scale depending on the type of data used.\nThis approach recognizes that data quality is not binary, and data limitations should not prevent insurers from getting started\non their net-zero underwriting journey. Insurers should use the highest-quality data that is available, but improve data quality\nover time where possible.\nThis collection of data - company emissions (both reported and estimated) and revenues, along with the insurers internal data\n(premiums) - must be aggregated across the entire underwriting portfolio. This requires automated name-matching to ensure\nthat external and internal data sources are correctly aligned. Data quality must also be quantified and aggregated.\nDespite these challenges, the resulting collection of data provides insurers with an opportunity to understand their emissions\nexposures in detail, and to use this information to effectively engage with customers on their transition to net-zero. Insurers\nmay perform detailed attribution and what-if analyses. In particular, they can measure how emissions can be attributed to\ndifferent sectors and sub-portfolios, how they have changed over time, and how those changes are attributed between\nchanges in underlying emissions and changes in portfolio composition. Insurers may also seek to measure the marginal\ncontribution of new accounts, or more generally how their IAEs might change in future under different assumptions. For\nexample, they may explore the impact of potential reductions in customers’ emissions based on the customers’ own targets.\nWhile the PCAF standard is focused on GHG emissions, there are a host of other Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\nconsiderations that are increasingly being factored into insurance companies’ strategies and underwriting workflows5. Insurers\nmay also take this opportunity to build a broad analytical capability for their underwriting portfolios, allowing them to\nmeasure and manage a range of ESG factors in addition to GHG emissions.\n5 Integrating ESG into portfolio management and underwriting workflows: the state of the market, Moody’s Analytics (2022)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INSURANCE-ASSOCIATED GHG EMISSIONS: THE PCAF MEASUREMENT STANDARD 3© 2022 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
