More auto loans were delinquent\nin January than at any point since mid-2005. Additionally, recent vintages of loans have been\nunderperforming, a trend that has frequently been blamed on the failure to account for inflated credit\nscores in the population after the pandemic’s cash windfalls and loan accommodations. However, loan\nbehavior is more complex as a bifurcation has emerged between new and used vehicles.\nLenders hit a bumpy road with used cars\nBefore the pandemic, delinquency rates among new and used vehicles moved in tandem. During the pan-\ndemic, delinquencies on both types of auto loans decreased because of stimulus payments, reduced spend-\ning and forbearance programs. Earlier this year, delinquencies1 on used-vehicle loans surpassed pre-pan-\ndemic levels, while delinquencies on new-vehicle loans remained lower. As pandemic conditions normalize\nand used-car prices decrease, delinquencies are increasing more severely for used vehicles than new ones\n(see Chart 1).\nAuto lenders have faced a challenging situation during the pandemic as the average age of vehicles in their\nloan books has increased. Because of the shortage of new vehicles and the high prices of used ones, buyers\nhave opted for older and less dependable vehicles to save on costs. This has put them at a higher risk of un-\nexpected expenses in the future. Consequently, lenders’ exposure to these risky assets has increased, mak-\ning it a cause for concern.\nAll used up\nThe rise in used-car delinquency rates can be attributed to several factors. For one, the pandemic disrupted\nthe supply chain for new cars, leading to a shortage. As a result, more people have turned to much older\ncars as a substitute, causing the average age of vehicles in a portfolio to increase (see Chart 2). This poses\na challenge for lenders, as the age of a vehicle at the time of purchase is usually a reliable indicator of the\nlikelihood of defaulting on an auto loan. Ultimately, the risk of default is linked to the vehicle’s value, which\nis determined by its age. Older cars are more susceptible to breakdowns and do not come with warranties.\n1 Data from EDGAR.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Driving to Default in unafforDable useD Cars 2Chart 1: Two Cars Diverge at a Yellow Light…\nDelinquency rate, % of $, 3-mo MA\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n18 19 20 21 22 23\nUsed vehicles New vehicles\nSources: SEC, Moody’s Analytics\nChart 2: …And Old, Used Cars Are the Ones More Traveled By\n54 47\n53 46\n45\n52\n44\n51\n43\n50\n42\n49\n41\n48 40\n18 19 20 21 22 23\nAvg age of used vehicles, mo (L) Used-vehicle share of all loans, % (R)\nSources: SEC, Moody’s Analytics\nThe fast lane to buyer’s remorse\nUsed-car price increases blew past those of new vehicles during the pandemic, making them particularly\nexpensive purchases. While inflation especially hurts lower-income borrowers, it can be challenging for\nany borrower to justify making payments on a rapidly depreciating asset. Used-vehicle prices, once rapidly\noutpacing broader inflation pressures and new-vehicle prices, have now fallen 9% to 15% from their peak,\ndepending on the month of observation (see Chart 3). They are expected to continue dropping, save for an-\nother shock to production such as an auto worker strike. A significant share of buyers who purchased used\nvehicles at the peak in late 2021 and early 2022 will be underwater on their loans by now.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Driving to Default in unafforDable useD Cars 3Chart 3: Are Used Cars Worth the Ride?\nUsed-car CPI/new-car CPI\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nWatch for disabled vehicles ahead\nUsed-car owners are feeling the pinch of soaring maintenance and insurance costs, which may cause some\nborrowers to reevaluate whether it is worth keeping the loan altogether. One of the consequences of the\nprevious surges in vehicle prices is the increase in ownership costs, excluding fuel. Since the end of 2019,\nthe CPI for motor vehicle maintenance and repair has increased more than 29%, and motor vehicle insur-\nance experienced an increase of more than 25% (see Chart 4). As used vehicles are less reliable, used-ve-\nhicle borrowers should be more sensitive to these costs. By comparison, the overall CPI rose 17.7% at the\nsame time.\nChart 4: Higher Maintenance and Insurance Drive Used-Car Borrowers to Default\nCPI, % change yrago\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\nJan-21 Apr-21 Jul-21 Oct-21 Jan-22 Apr-22 Jul-22 Oct-22 Jan-23 Apr-23 Jul-23\nMotor vehicle maintenance and repair Motor vehicle insurance\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Driving to Default in unafforDable useD Cars 4Expensive auto parts and labor have contributed to the rise in repair costs for borrowers and insurers. Addi-\ntionally, the increase in the value of vehicles since the pandemic began has not only reinforced higher repair\ncosts but also led to higher replacement costs for cars and trucks. It is worth noting that there is an almost\nyear-long delay between the peak in new-vehicle price inflation and the highest level of cost pressures ob-\nserved in motor vehicle maintenance, repair and auto insurance. There is not much relief in sight for cost of\nownership, either. Maintenance costs are labor-dependent and believed to have stronger price momentum\nthan used-vehicle prices. Further, it is important to mention that the CPI for motor vehicle insurance is reac-\ncelerating, possibly because of a significant increase in accidents and fatalities since the pandemic began.2\nLimited credit visibility\nConventional wisdom suggests that lenders would adequately control the risks of high prices in efficient\nmarkets. Some risks are easily quantifiable. Indeed, we did see the average loan-to-value ratio decline by\nabout 5% as lenders implemented stricter requirements. Some risks are harder to measure, such as the de-\ngree of desperation inherent in a buyer who decides to purchase a used vehicle during a period of extreme\novervaluation and when the need to rely on a car to hold a job is vastly reduced in the wake of the pandem-\nic. Whether or not lenders recognized the problems of adverse selection and overvaluation of vehicles, the\ndegree of tightening of lending standards over the past couple of years now appears insufficient for used\ncars (see Chart 5).\nChart 5: Not Enough Tightening in Used-Vehicle Origination Credit Standards\nCredit score Loan term, mo\n750 68.5\n730 68.0\n710 67.5\n690 67.0\n670 66.5\n18 19 20 21 22 23 18 19 20 21 22 23\nLoan-to-value ratio, % Payment-to-income ratio, %\n108 25\n104\n20\n100\n15\n96\n92 10\n18 19 20 21 22 23 18 19 20 21 22 23\nUsed vehicles New vehicles\nSources: SEC, Moody’s Analytics\nThe only portfolio average credit metric among used-car loans that is noticeably tighter versus one year\nprior is LTV. An oft-cited justification for the poor credit performance is inflated credit scores. If lenders\nwere not accurately assessing credit scores, we would see an increase in delinquencies in both new and\nused vehicles. Lenders did not even appreciably tighten standards on new vehicles, as average credit scores\nincreased slightly and LTV ratios remained flat, and yet new-vehicle delinquencies have not jumped in the\nsame way as with used vehicles. An additional explanation for rising auto delinquencies is that used-car\n2 Statistics from NHTSA show a 7.3% and 10.1% increase in traffic fatalities in 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Driving to Default in unafforDable useD Cars 5borrowers appear to have taken on loans they could not afford as payment-to-income increased at least\n50% since 2019. As conditions have not yet normalized since the pandemic, lenders need to monitor other\naspects of the credit box beyond credit scores, including collateral value and ability to pay, to obtain a more\nrobust view of credit risk.\nCaution: Rough road ahead\nAuto lenders are right to be cautious. Industry expectations for declining used-car prices coupled with el-\nevated risk in borrower profiles are a dangerous combination. Indeed, our quantitative models like that in\nour Portfolio Analyzer product point to significant expected losses on current portfolios, particularly on the\nolder used vehicles. For each additional year of wear and tear on a used car, we expect projected loan losses\nto increase by 11%.\nAn uncomfortably high risk of economic contraction further contributes to the possibility of severe losses.\nA severe recession, like the one in our S4 scenario, would cripple already-struggling used-vehicle borrowers,\nincreasing expected losses on 2023 originations by an additional 34% (see Chart 6). New-vehicle loans,\nstill the bright light in a concerning consumer credit sector, would not escape a recession unscathed either.\nLoans for newer vehicles typically are to more established borrowers. They are relatively more sensitive to\nan economic downturn than less established borrowers who are more likely to experience job loss through-\nout the entire business cycle. As last year’s borrowers have seen car values fall since they purchased their\ncar, losses on 2022 loans are even more sensitive to a downturn. We could expect to see losses increase by\nmore than 40% from baseline among this population.\nChart 6: Recession Would Lead to Greater Losses\nExpected lifetime loss under S4, % increase from baseline\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n2022 vintage 2023 vintage\nUsed vehicles New vehicles\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nAccording to the third-quarter Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank Lending Practices, the net percentage of\nbanks tightening standards on auto loans continues to increase. Although some aspects of the vehicle mar-\nket, such as auto production, show signs of normalization, caution is warranted.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Driving to Default in unafforDable useD Cars 6About the Authors\nDavid Fieldhouse is a director in Predictive Analytics who oversees the development of retail and municipal loan\nperformance models for financial lending institutions.
