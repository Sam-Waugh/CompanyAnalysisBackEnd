Introduction\nModeling new origination is an important part of forecasting a portfolio’s future dynamics. These modeling processes are\nbecoming more and more prevalent for capital and risk management, stress testing, and strategic planning. As the originated\namount and other loan characteristics depend on the macro environment, banks have been focusing more in recent years on\nmodeling the relationship between new origination and the macro environment. These types of origination models are important,\nparticularly in light of recent regulatory stress testing frameworks\nFor example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve implemented the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Test (“DFAST”) to assess the capital adequacy of large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs). As part of the\nassessment, BHCs must develop models that estimate how Pre-Provision Net Revenue (“PPNR”) and portfolio losses respond to\nvarious macroeconomic shocks. Portfolio loss and interest income, an important component of PPNR, strongly depend upon loan\norigination forecasts under different macroeconomic scenarios. Building models for new origination is often challenging due to the\nlack of sufficient internal and external historical data on loan origination with appropriate levels of granularity.\nThis paper studies C&I loan origination dynamics for different segments. We create the loan origination historical time series\nbased on the Loan Accounting System (CRD/LAS) data extracted from Moody’s Analytics Credit Research Database (CRD™). The\nCRD/LAS data includes quarterly, loan-level variables such as loan type, loan origination and maturity dates, interest charged and\noutstanding balance, as well as borrower-level information such as industry, credit rating, and size. The data covers multiple U.S.\nbanks from 2000–2015 and allows for customized segmentation. An important question for new origination models is what type\nof data segmentation is important. To answer this question, we segment our data into different subsets according to borrower-\nand loan-level characteristics, such as credit rating and tenor. We then compare the loan origination dynamics across segments\nand examine whether their cyclical patterns, if any, differ sufficiently enough to warrant modeling them separately.\nNote, the time span of data coverage for different banks in the CRD/LAS dataset depends on when each bank begins contributing\ndata and when it stops. Without adjustment, when the data period for a particular bank begins or ends, the aggregated loan\norigination amount typically jumps or drops sharply. Similarly, when an existing bank in the dataset experiences an M&A event,\nthe loan origination amount can also jump. In our analysis, we adjust the aggregate loan origination growth rates to remove the\nimpact of these events — we only account for the “organic” growth of loan origination, typically what stress testing models\nattempt to capture. We then adjust the growth rates to create loan origination indices, the focus of our study.\nWhile there is very limited public data to compare, we use Call Report and FR Y-9C data to show that the CRD/LAS data\nrepresents the C&I portfolio of the contributing banks well. The data also matches the aggregated portfolio dynamics for all CCAR\nbanks. Given the dataset’s size and the similarity in new origination dynamics across banks, we find that the CRD/LAS data also\nreasonably represents the aggregate portfolio dynamics for all banks (i.e., all depository institutions).\nResults show that some segmentation is important when modeling C&I loan origination. A few examples:\n1. Lending to short-term loans grows primarily during the recession and remains stagnant after the crisis. Post-crisis lending\nto investment-grade borrowers recovers more strongly than to non-investment-grade borrowers. When segmenting the\ndata by both credit quality and tenor, we further find that tenor seems to explain the origination dynamics better than\ncredit quality.\n2. The financial sector experiences a stronger decline in loan origination during the crisis and stronger growth during recent\nyears compared to the non-financial sectors. For the Mining, Oil & Gas sector, loan origination is correlates highly with\nthe price of crude oil. This finding explains 2014’s sharp drop in loan origination, unique to this sector.\n3. Lending to credit lines increases significantly at the beginning of the recession. Separating term loans from credit lines\nallows accounting for the income from the undrawn amount.\nWe organize the remainder of the paper as follows:\n» Section 2 describes and validates the CRD/LAS data.\n» Section 3 discusses the methodology for constructing indices of loan origination amount.\n» Section 4 shows the loan origination indices we construct for different segments and examines their cyclical patterns.\n» Section 5 concludes.\n3 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATA2. Data Description\n2.1 Data Source – Moody’s Analytics CRD/LAS Data\nWe extract the data used for this study from Moody’s proprietary Credit Research Database (CRD), the world’s largest private firm\ndatabase of middle market borrowers. It consists of data contributed by more than 75 financial institutions (including 19 U.S.\nBanks) and various vended data sources. Total assets of these institutions range from $20 billion to $2 trillion USD. CRD\nparticipants provide quarterly portfolio snapshots with obligor- and loan-level data.\nThe CRD/LAS dataset used in this study is one component of the CRD. It contains quarterly loan-level data with observations\nbeginning in the second quarter of 2000 and ending in the fourth quarter of 2015. There are more than 50 fields for the CRD/LAS\ndataset. At the borrower level, the data includes size, region, rating, and industry. At the loan level, fields such as balance,\ncommitment, tenor, and spread are available.\nThe CRD/LAS dataset is uniquely suitable for modeling new origination for a few reasons. First, it is large and representative. As of\nthe end of 2015, the balance of the loans in the final data set (after data cleaning and filtering) is around 350 Billion USD, which\nrepresents about 20% of the entire US banking industry as illustrated in Figure 1. Second, the dataset comes from multiple U.S.\nbanks, and the idiosyncratic data noise of individual banks is largely washed out when the data is aggregated. Third, it is the only\ndataset available in the market that includes detailed origination, as well as interest rate information, on individual C&I loans.\nMore importantly, the dataset includes both borrower- and loan-level information, which provides flexibility in custom\nsegmentation, based on borrower or loan characteristics. For example, the dataset contains loan type information to separate\nterm loans from credit line, important for PPNR modeling, as capturing the dynamics of both drawn and undrawn amounts of\ncredit lines allows forecasting the income generated from the undrawn amount. Additionally, the data covers a full economic\ncycle, imperative for accurately estimating the historical relationship between loan origination and the macroeconomic\nenvironment.\nFigure 1 The CRD/LAS C&I Loan Balance represents a significant percentage of the National C&I Loan Balance.\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n2.2 Data Cleaning and Validation\nThe contributing banks self-report the CRD/LAS data, and it may contain errors. To ensure the quality of the data used to\nconstruct loan origination time series, we compare individual bank’s C&I loan balance seen in the dataset to the bank’s C&I loan\nbalance, reported in the FR Y-9C report.1\nWe conduct the data validation at the balance level, because there is no public data source for loan origination at the bank level.\nSince there may be differences between the C&I portfolio a bank contributes to the CRD/LAS dataset and the C&I portfolio the\n1 Since we are only interested in the C&I loans in this study, we remove from the CRD/LAS dataset non-C&I loans, such as CRE loans and loans lent to non-\nprofit organizations.\n)%(\negatnecreP\n13213002 13904002 13605002 13306002 13216002 13907002 13608002 13309002 13219002 13900102 13601102 13302102 13212102 13903102 13604102 13305102 13215102\n4 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAbank reports in its FR Y-9C, we do not expect the two balances to match precisely. However, we validate that the CRD/LAS\nportfolio represents the bank’s C&I portfolio well by making sure its balance does not differ too much from that reported in the FR\nY-9C report, and that it moves together (i.e., in parallel) with the FR Y-9C balance over time, exhibiting a similar relationship with\nthe macro environment.\nWe remove periods where the loan balance seen in the CRD/LAS dataset does not move in parallel with that reported in the bank’s\nFR Y-9C report from the dataset. The resulting CRD/LAS dataset contains data from 18 contributing U.S. banks, with 670,293\nborrowers and 1,398,955 facilities2 and a total of 20,494,726 loan-level observations. Figure 2 shows the sample coverage over\ntime, including the number of contributing banks, unique borrowers, and unique facilities.\nFigure 2 Sample Coverage of the CRD/LAS Dataset.\n16 500,000\n450,000\n14\n400,000\n12\n350,000\n10\n300,000\n8 250,000\n200,000\n6\n150,000\n4\n100,000\n2\n50,000\n0 0\nFor confidentiality reasons, we cannot show individual bank’s data. Instead, we construct an aggregated C&I loan balance index to\nillustrate how representative the CRD/LAS data is of the contributing bank’s C&I portfolios. Figure 3 compares the C&I loan\nbalance index constructed from CRD/LAS dataset with that reported in corresponding bank holding companies’ FR Y-9C. In both\ncases, we adjust the aggregated growth rates for banks’ entry, exit, and mergers and acquisitions. We can see that the indices from\nthe two sources largely resemble each other.\n2 In the CRD/LAS dataset, a facility contains a set of loans, possibly with different characteristics such as loan type and maturity, under a formal agreement\nbetween the banks and the borrowers to help companies obtain operating capital. The agreement details the lending amounts, interest rate, payment terms,\nand conditions. A facility may apply to different projects or departments in a business.\ntnuoC\nknaB\ntnuoC\nytilicaF/reworroB\nBank Count (left) Borrower Count (right) Facility Count (right)\n5 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAFigure 3 CRD/LAS C&I Loan Balance is Representative of the Contributing Banks’ Aggregate C&I Balance.\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nFigure 4 compares the C&I loan balance index constructed from CRD/LAS dataset with that reported in the CCAR banks’ FR Y-9C.\nThe orange line represents the index of aggregated outstanding C&I loan balance of the 33 CCAR banks.

Methodology for Constructing Loan Origination Indices\n3.1 Loan Origination Index\nBanks’ entries and exits can result in sudden jumps in the aggregated new origination amount. Similarly, banks’ mergers and\nacquisitions may result in similar jumps and require adjustments. Using the unadjusted data for modeling would wrongly attribute\nthese jumps to the macro environment and result in a misleading model. Figure 6 illustrates accounting for mergers and\nacquisitions. The green line represents the total C&I loan balance of one participating bank. The blue line represents the C&I loan\nbalance excluding the loans from mergers and acquisitions. Unlike the green line, the blue line does not show a sudden increase at\nthe time of mergers and acquisitions, especially during 2007, and better represents the intrinsic growth of the loan balance.3\nNew origination models aim to capture organic loan origination growth. We begin by estimating the growth rate in new\norigination during each quarter, clean of the effects of banks’ entries/exits and M&A. To better illustrate the dynamics of new\norigination over time, we then translate these growth rates to level indices that represent the new origination dynamics for the\naggregate set of banks. The index level at a given quarter t is computed as\nwhere New Orig QoQ Growth is the𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼q𝐼𝐼ua𝐼𝐼r𝐼𝐼te𝑡𝑡r -=ov𝐼𝐼e𝐼𝐼r𝐼𝐼-q𝐼𝐼u𝐼𝐼a𝑡𝑡r−t1er∗ g(r1ow+t𝑁𝑁h i𝐼𝐼n𝑁𝑁 t h𝑂𝑂e𝑂𝑂 a𝑂𝑂d𝑂𝑂j u𝑄𝑄st𝑄𝑄e𝑄𝑄d n𝐺𝐺e𝑂𝑂w𝑄𝑄 𝑁𝑁or𝐺𝐺igℎin𝑡𝑡)ation amount, discussed in detail in\nSection 3.3. All the indices begin from 100 at Q4 2004 due to the scarce data during the early part of the sample.\n𝑡𝑡\nFigure 6 Effect of Accounting for Mergers and Acquisitions.\n3.2 Identifying Loan Origination\nIn this study, a loan-level observation is identified as new origination when it represents the first appearance of the loan in the\ndataset and the date of this appearance is in the same or the following quarter as its recorded origination date. The qualification\ncriteria on the consistency between first observation date and recorded origination date is placed to avoid mistaking existing loans\nwith missing data history for newly originated loans.\nWe define the origination amount as the outstanding balance amount, since the origination amount is typically equal to the\nbalance amount at origination. We aggregate the origination amount based on the time the loans originate. For example, for a\nloan whose origination date is in the quarter prior to the quarter of its first appearance, the origination amount is counted in the\nquarter of its origination date.\n3 We use the balance to illustrate the effect of mergers and acquisitions but the impact to the loan origination is similar.\necnalaB\nnaoL\nI&C\n403002 204002 404002 205002 405002 206002 406002 207002 407002 208002 408002 209002 409002 200102 400102 201102 401102 202102 402102 203102 403102 204102 404102 205102 405102\nCRD/LAS (M&A Unadjusted) M&A Date\nCRD/LAS (M&A Adjusted) SDI Call Report (M&A unadjusted)\n8 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAFor the purposes of studying loan origination dynamics, we filter out all snapshots of each loan, except for its original snapshot at\norigination. The resulting dataset contains origination data from 18 banks. The dataset includes 697,685 observations — each\nrepresenting a loan snapshot.\nFigure 7 shows the distribution of the size of a single loan origination. The median size of a new origination is around S100,000\nUSD.\nFigure 7 Distribution of the Size of Individual Loan Origination.\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nbelow 25K 25K-100K100K-250K250K-1MM1MM-5MM above\n5MM\n3.3 Method for Computing New Origination Growth Rates\nThe timespan of data coverage for different banks in the CRD/LAS dataset depends on when each bank begins submitting data and\nwhen it stops. When the data period for a particular bank begins (referred to as “bank entry”) or ends (referred to as “bank exit”),\nthe aggregated loan origination amount can exhibit a sharp jump. Similarly, when an existing bank in the dataset experiences an\nM&A event, the loan origination amount can also exhibit a jump. In our analysis, we adjust the quarterly growth rates of aggregate\nloan origination to remove the impact of these events. In other words, we only account for the “organic” loan origination growth,\ntypically what stress testing models aim to predict. We then use the adjusted growth rates to create loan origination indices to\ndemonstrate the origination dynamics over time.\nTo account for bank entry and exit, we make sure that we use the same set of banks for the beginning and end of each quarter\nwhen calculating the growth rate. Specifically, for a quarter where a bank entry occurs, we only have information for a particular\nbank at the end of the quarter, but not at the beginning. For consistency, we calculate the total new origination amount at both\nthe beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter, excluding data from the newly entered bank. We use these two values of\nnew origination amount to compute the new origination growth rate for this quarter. For the following quarter, we already have\nthe bank’s data for both the beginning and end of the quarter, so we include the newly added bank’s data in the growth rate\ncalculation.\nFor a quarter where a bank exit occurs, we only have information for this particular bank at the beginning of the quarter, but not at\nthe end. For consistency, we calculate the total new origination amount at both the beginning and end of the quarter, excluding\ndata from the exiting bank. We use these two values of new origination amount to compute the new origination growth rate for\nthis quarter.\nSimilarly, when a contributing bank has an M&A event4 in a quarter, we exclude the bank’s data when calculating the growth rate\nfor the quarter. In addition, since we allow the first observation date to be one quarter later than the recorded new origination\ndate when identifying new origination, we also exclude the bank’s data when calculating the aggregated growth rate in the\n4 We obtain M&A event dates from the list of mergers and acquisitions that have occurred since 1976 provided by Federal Reserve.

Dynamics of New Origination\n4.1 Aggregated New Origination\nBased on the methodology described in the previous section, we construct new origination indices. Figure 8 shows the aggregate\nnew origination index. In general, loan origination shows a significant decline during the Great Recession followed by a strong\nrecovery. Since 2012, growth has been more sluggish.\nNote, a strong seasonality effect is present in the origination growth rate. The growth rate tends to be much higher in the second\nand fourth quarters of each year than in the first and third quarters. To remove the seasonal variation, we smooth the new\norigination growth rate by using a backward-looking, four-quarter moving average value. Figure 8 also plots the resulting\nsmoothed new origination index. We can see that both the smoothed and unsmoothed indices exhibit the same general pattern\nover time. Because the seasonality effect typically has little to do with the macroeconomic environment, it is usually not the focus\nof stress testing models. Therefore, to allow the data patterns to show clearly, the following sections only provide smoothed new\norigination indices, with seasonality effects removed.\nFigure 8 New Origination Indices for All Loans.\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nBanks use various ways to mitigate their lending risk in response to macroeconomic shocks. For example, risk can be limited by\nshortening the contractual maturity of the loans or by lending to safer borrowers. Demand for loans may also vary. For these\nreasons, we segment loans according to loan and borrower characteristics such as loan tenor, borrower’s industry, and credit\nquality to study the dynamics of loan origination to different segments.\n4.2 Segmentation by Loan Type\nTerm loan and credit lines are two different financing tools. With a term loan, the borrowers must repay the full amount at\nmaturity. Lines of credit allow borrowers to draw down, repay, and redraw as needed within an agreed upon period. The repaying\nand re-borrowing features provide businesses with the flexibility to fund capital needs. This type of financing can be especially\nhelpful during times of income/expense uncertainty. This motivates us to segment our sample based on loan type in order to\nexplore whether the new origination of different loan types have different dynamics over time. Figure 9 plots the new origination\nindices for term loans and lines of credit.\nIn general, loan origination to both term loans and l credit lines grows gradually before the financial crisis, with lending to credit\nlines increasing more significantly at the beginning of the recession. Lending to both loan types decreases sharply during the\nrecession and recovers after the crisis. One explanation for these dynamics may be that the flexibility of credit lines allows\nborrowers to obtain the funds quickly, in order to meet their short-term capital needs. A few quarters into the recession, lending\nto both term loan and lines of credit decreases when banks begin tightening credit.\n)001=4Q4002(\nnoitanigirO\nweN\n404002 205002 405002 206002 406002 207002 407002 208002 408002 209002 409002 200102 400102 201102 401102 202102 402102 203102 403102 204102 404102 205102 405102\nNew Origination Index\nSmoothed New Origination Index with Four Quarters Moving Average\n11 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAFigure 9 New Origination Indices for Term Loans and Lines of Credit.\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n4.3 Segmentation by Borrower’s Industry\nThe CRD/LAS dataset includes NAICS codes for borrowers, which can be used for a detailed segmentation by industry. To illustrate\nthe importance of segmentation by industry, we examine the origination dynamics for two sectors as examples: the financial\nsector and the Mining, Oil & Gas sector. We compare separately the loan origination of the two sectors with the rest of the\nsectors.\nWe begin by segmenting the data into financial and non-financial sectors. This step is mainly due to the observation that some\nmacro-environments can have a different impact on financial and non-financial firms. For example, the most recent recession was,\nat its core, a financial sector crisis, which propagated to other sectors. Figure 10 plots the new origination indices for loans given to\nborrowers in the financial sector and the non-financial sector.\nIn general, loan origination to both the financial and non-financial sectors begins to decline around the same time and decreases\nsharply at the beginning of the Great Recession. During the financial crisis, lending to both industry segments decreases, with the\nfinancial segment experiencing significantly more decline. Lending to financial firms continues to decline until Q2 2010, while\nlending to non-financial firms begins recovering one quarter earlier. In recent years, loan origination to financial firms has seen\nstronger growth.\n)001=4Q4002(\nnoitanigirO\nweN\n404002 205002 405002 206002 406002 207002 407002 208002 408002 209002 409002 200102 400102 201102 401102 202102 402102 203102 403102 204102 404102 205102 405102\nTermLoan LOC All\n12 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAFigure 10 New Origination Indices for Loans Lent to Financial and Non-Financial Industries.\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nThe sharp drop in oil prices around 2014 had a significant impact on several industries. While some industries benefit from lower\nprices, others are severely affected by it. This industry-specific reaction to oil price change is a good example for the importance of\nsegmentation by industry when modeling new origination. We illustrate this point by comparing new origination to Mining, Oil &\nGas versus all other industries.\nFigure 11 plots the new origination indices for loans made to borrowers in the Mining, Oil & Gas sector and the rest of the sectors.\nLoan origination to Mining, Oil & Gas sector (plotted in red) is highly correlated with the crude oil price (plotted in green). The\nsignificant decline of lending in 2015 corresponds to the oil price drop. For other industries, origination remains stable after\nrecovering from the financial crisis. Results show the unique dynamics of the Mining, Oil & Gas sector and suggest the need for\nindustry segmentation.\nFigure 11 New Origination Indices for Loans Made to Mining, Oil & Gas vs. Other Industries.\n)001=4Q4002(\nnoitanigirO\nweN\n404002 205002 405002 206002 406002 207002 407002 208002 408002 209002 409002 200102 400102 201102 401102 202102 402102 203102 403102 204102 404102 205102 405102\nFin NonFin All\n800 140\n700 120\n600\n100\n500\n80\n400\n60\n300\n40\n200\n100 20\n0 0\n)001=206002(\nnoitanigirO\nweN\necirP\nliO\nedurC\nWTI Crude Oil Prices Mining, Oil&Gas\nOther Industries\n13 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATA4.4 Segmentation by Tenor\nTwo of the main uses of C&I loans are to finance borrowers’ short-term liquidity needs and to fund long-term investments. During\ndifferent macroeconomic environments, the demand for short-term and long-term funding is likely different. For example, during\nan economic crisis, borrowers’ needs for short-term liquidity may spike, which can increase origination of short-term loans.\nSimilarly, during an economic boom, the funding needed for long-term investments may become relatively more important. In\naddition, banks may use loan tenor as a way to control for risk, and they are more willing to extend shorter-term loans during\neconomic downturns. As a result, we expect origination of short-term and long-term loans to exhibit different cyclical patterns.\nWe segment our origination data by loan tenor to explore the new origination dynamics of short-term and long-term loans over\ntime. Specifically, we classify all loans into two segments: those with less than two-year tenor at origination (referred to as “Short-\nTenor” loans) and those with more than two-year tenor at origination (referred to as “Long-Tenor” loans). Figure 12 plots new\norigination indices for these tenor segments.\nPrior to the crisis, loan origination of the Long-Tenor segment experience steady growth while lending to Short-Tenor segment\nonly starts to increase at the beginning of the crisis. A few quarters into the recession, both segments experience significant decline\nin origination with Short-Tenor segment declining slower initially. The drop is more severe for Long-Term lending. After the\nrecession, the origination of Long-Tenor loans bounces back quickly exceeding the pre-crisis level, and then stays at a high level. In\ncontrast, new origination of Short-Tenor loans remain stagnant post-crisis.\nThe different dynamics observed for short- and long-tenor lending remain consistent with the idea that in times of crisis, banks use\nshort-term lending as a way to mitigate credit risk, as well as to meet the increase in demand for short-term borrowing from firms\ntrying to stay afloat. In good economic times, firms look for longer-term loans to fund investments, and banks are more open to\nlend for longer term when they are less worried about credit risk, resulting in a sharp increase in long-term loan originations. The\nstark differences in origination dynamics across tenor segments suggests that this type of segmentation is extremely important to\ncapture when modeling new origination.\nFigure 12 New Origination Indices Segmented by Loan Tenor.\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n4.5 Segmentation by Credit Quality\nA bank’s internal rating captures its assessment of borrower credit quality. Banks use internal ratings for credit approval and\nportfolio monitoring. When the economy is expanding, banks tend to lend more to riskier firms to increase the revenue. During an\neconomic downturn, banks are more concerned with credit risk, and tend to lend more to safer firms. As a result, we expect\noriginations of different credit quality segments to exhibit different cyclical patterns. In this section, we separate our sample based\non borrower’s rating to study how credit quality affects new originations. Figure 13 plots the new origination indices for loans with\ninvestment-grade ratings versus those with non-investment grade ratings.\nLoan origination to non-investment-grade borrowers grows faster in the years leading to the Great Recession. During the crisis,\nloan origination to both rating segments exhibits a sharp decline. Percentage-wise, it appears that loan origination to investment-\ngrade borrowers declines relatively more during the crisis. We believe this sharper decrease is partly due to the effect of credit\nmigration. During the crisis, the credit quality of many firms deteriorates, resulting in many rating downgrades from investment-\n)001=4Q5002(\nnoitanigirO\nweN\n405002 206002 406002 207002 407002 208002 408002 209002 409002 200102 400102 201102 401102 202102 402102 203102 403102 204102 404102 205102 405102\nLong Short All\n14 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAgrade to non-investment grade. These downgrades make the universe of investment grade borrowers smaller, causing a further\ndecrease in new origination to investment-grade borrowers during downturns. Last, post-crisis lending to investment-grade\nborrowers recovers more strongly than to non-investment-grade borrowers and passes its pre-crisis level.\nFigure 13 New Origination Indices for Loans Segmented by Credit Quality.\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n4.6 Segmentation by Both Credit Quality and Tenor\nCredit quality and tenor seem to be the main two levers banks use to mitigate risk in their lending. In an effort to separate the\neffects of these two factors, we segment loans by both credit quality and tenor to examine one while controlling for the other.\nFigure 14 plots the indices of new origination segmented by both credit quality and tenor. While both are important, it appears\nthat tenor plays an even bigger role than credit quality in explaining loan origination dynamics. This is likely driven by banks issuing\nshorter-term loans during downturns as a way to mitigate liquidity and credit risk, and borrowers looking for longer-term loans in\ngood economic times to fund longer-term investments. New origination of long-term loans (both investment grade and non-\ninvestment grade) begins to decrease at the beginning of the crisis, while lending to short-term loans declines slightly for two\nquarters and then drops sharply. The increase in short-term loan origination is especially stark leading into the crisis, as banks try\nto limit risk. After the crisis, origination of Long-Tenor loans recovers and grows faster than Short-Tenor loans. In fact, it looks like\nshort term lending has not recovered much since the crisis. The dynamics of new origination are more similar across different\ncredit quality segments of the same tenor, than across different tenor segments of the same credit quality. In other words, it\nappears that segmenting new origination by tenor explains the origination dynamics better than segmenting by credit quality\nalone.\n)001=4Q4002(\nnoitanigirO\nweN\n404002 205002 405002 206002 406002 207002 407002 208002 408002 209002 409002 200102 400102 201102 401102 202102 402102 203102 403102 204102 404102 205102 405102\nInvestment Grade Non-Investment Grade All\n15 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAFigure 14 New Origination Indices for Loans Segmented by Credit Quality and Tenor.\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nFigure 15 shows the composition of new origination across segments over time. Specifically, we compute the percentage of new\norigination amount attributed to each individual segment as a portion of the overall origination amount in each quarter. We can\nsee that the portion of new origination of short-tenor loans increases during financial crisis. After the crisis, origination of long-\ntenor loans begins to dominate, accounting for almost 80% of total origination from Q2 2011–Q4 2015. During this period, the\nproportion of investment grade loans with long tenor grows from 20% at the end of 2010 to 40% as of the end of 2015. This\nincrease in long-term lending to investment-grade borrowers post crisis is partly due to an improvement in credit quality of many\nborrowers during this period, increasing the overall size of the investment-grade segment.\nFigure 15 Composition of Loan Origination through Time.\n)001=4Q4002(\nnoitanigirO\nweN\nLong_IG Short_IG Long_NIG Short_NIG\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nShort_IG Long_IG Long_NIG Short_NIG\n16 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATA5. Summary\nThis study describes the Moody’s Loan Accounting System (CRD/LAS) dataset and constructing aggregated quarterly indices of\nloan origination using the data. The CRD/LAS dataset includes loan-level and borrower-level information, which provides flexibility\nfor customized segmentation and building granular models. Fields such as origination date and origination amount allow for better\nmodeling of new origination. This study is the first to provide large sample dynamics of loan origination to U.S. middle-market\nborrowers.\nWe validate the contributed C&I portfolio of each bank against its C&I loan balance reported in FR Y-9C. We also validate the\naggregate data against FR Y-9C and Call Reports of the contributing banks, CCAR banks, and the entire banking industry (i.e., all\ndepository institutions), and conclude that the CRD/LAS data is highly representative of all these groups.\nTo illustrate the importance of data segmentation when modeling C&I loan origination, we examine the origination dynamics for a\nfew segments. We look at segmentation by loan types, credit quality, loan tenor, and borrower’s industry. In general, new\norigination exhibits a decline during the financial crisis and recovery after the crisis, in-line with expectations. The severity of the\ndecline and the recovery speed varies by segment, as does the precise timing of the decline and recovery. For example, lending to\nthe Mining, Oil & Gas sector is highly correlated to the price of crude oil, and the sector should be modeled separately from other\nindustries in order to capture that factor.\nThe study suggests that tenor may be the most important dimension for segmentation. Lending to short-tenor loans does not\ndecline as much at the beginning of the recession when origination of long-tenor loans decreases significantly. After the crisis,\nlong-tenor lending recovers much faster, as borrowers look to fund long-term investments, and banks are less concerned with\nliquidity and credit risks. When segmenting the data by both credit quality and tenor, we further find that tenor seems to explain\norigination dynamics better than credit quality. In addition, segmenting by tenor provides better tenor estimates for newly\noriginated loans, which leads to better runoff projections and overall balance projections.\nThe study clearly shows that different segments of the C&I portfolio respond differently to the macro environment, and it is\nexceedingly important for loan origination models to capture these differences.\n17 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATAReferences\nChicago Federal Reserve, BHC Merger Data,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/Home/banking/financial-institution-reports/merger-data\nChicago Federal Reserve, FR Y-9C Data,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/banking/financial-institution-reports/bhc-data\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, SDI data, https://www2.fdic.gov/SDI/\n18 FEBRUARY 2017 WHAT DO 20 MILLION C&I LOAN OBSERVATIONS SAY ABOUT NEW ORIGINATION DYNAMICS? — INSIGHTS FROM MOODY’S ANALYTICS CRD DATA© 2017 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
