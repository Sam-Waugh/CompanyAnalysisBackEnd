These inflated appraisals have been identified as a\nsignificant contributing factor to the subsequent collapse in the mortgage market. The accuracy of appraisal values plays a\npivotal role in credit loss prediction, primarily because the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio significantly influences the probability\nof loan default and also has a notable impact on Loss Given Default (LGD) forecasts.\nLTV holds a central position in the assessment of borrowers' credit risk by underwriters. It directly contributes to\ndetermining the interest rates associated with mortgages. Lower LTV ratios not only enhance one's likelihood of securing\na mortgage but also result in more favorable interest rates.\nAppraisals are performed by licensed professionals known as appraisers, who typically determine a property's value by\ncomparing it to recent similar transactions. This process possesses a degree of subjectivity since appraisers must choose\nwhich comparable transactions to consider and make adjustments based on their assessments of property differences.\nFurthermore, there is a notable bias toward appraising properties at higher values because appraisers are typically hired by\noriginators. A low appraisal can jeopardize mortgage transactions, leading to a higher likelihood of transaction failure. The\npresence of moral hazard within the appraisal process elevates the potential for fraudulent activity in loan origination. The\nissue of moral hazard in home appraisals has long been recognized by researchers and professionals in the mortgage\nindustry.\nCho and Megbolugbe (1996) is one of the research papers that using Fannie Mae data shows in 80% of the cases appraisal\nis around 5% above the transaction purchase price. Agarwal, Ben-David, and Yao (2015) identify appraisal inflation in\nconforming mortgages and find out that the bias for refinance loans is above 5% and higher for transactions mediated\nthrough a broker and mortgages with inflated valuations default more often. Related evidence from Ben-David (2011) and\nCarrillo (2013) indicates that in some cases transaction prices are also biased upward due to fraud and collusion between\nbuyers and sellers. Griffin and Maturana (2016b) estimate that as many as 45% of non-agency securitized loans have\noverstated appraisals. Eriksen et.al (2020) find that on average there were 4.2% to 8.3% higher appraisals than the purchase\nprice. Kruger and Maturana (2020), using loan level data from New Century Financial Corporation, showed that there is a\ndifference between property purchase price and Automated Valuation Model (AVM). Based on their analysis, they find that\nnon-agency securitized loan appraisals are on average 5% higher than AVM valuations.\nIn this research study, we analyze sales price data for properties that have undergone the foreclosure process. It's important\nto note that the sale prices of these homes may differ from market expectations, primarily because banks and lenders are\noften motivated to expedite loan liquidation. Additionally, properties subjected to foreclosure proceedings may not have\nreceived proper maintenance. Nevertheless, these sales prices serve as dependable indicators of property values.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS 3 Uncovering Deceptive Practices1 DATA\nWe analyzed a dataset consisting of 1,036,980 homes that were liquidated from Fannie and Freddie between January 2005\nand February 2021. This dataset contains information on various aspects, including the sales price at the time of liquidation,\nas well as associated costs such as foreclosure expenses, unpaid property taxes, maintenance costs, and accrued interest.\nThe sales price recorded in the dataset reflects the property's value at the point of liquidation, which we consider to be a\nreliable indicator of its worth at that time. However, it's important to note that properties liquidated in this manner may\noften have lower values compared to well-maintained homes, primarily due to neglect and the lenders' urgency to recoup\ntheir losses. It is also anticipated that these lenders typically offer these properties at significant discounts in order to\nfacilitate a quicker sale.\nThe Home Price Index (HPI) is a crucial tool for assessing home price trends in the United States, at both the national,\nstate, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) levels. This valuable data, sourced from the National Association of Realtors,\nis meticulously refined and analyzed by Moody's Analytics. Spanning 371 MSAs throughout the United States, the HPI\noffers a granular perspective, enabling a detailed exploration of home price fluctuations in diverse regions. This granularity\nis particularly beneficial for discerning the variations in HPIs across different geographic areas within the country.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS 4 Uncovering Deceptive Practices2 MODEL AND RESULTS:\nThe dependent variable used in the model is the home price change since origination in percentage. The appraisal value at\norigination and the sales price at liquidation has been used to derive the home price change since origination and it is\ncompared with HPI growth rate since origination. This is the model estimated:\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑅𝑅 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅 𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔ℎ 𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅\n=𝛼𝛼0+ 𝛽𝛽1 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔ℎ 𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅 𝑠𝑠𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅 𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅𝐻𝐻𝑠𝑠+ 𝛽𝛽2 𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹+ 𝛽𝛽3 𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝𝑔𝑔 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅\n+ 𝛽𝛽4 𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑂𝑂𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠+ 𝛽𝛽5𝐻𝐻𝑂𝑂𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻𝑠𝑠𝑅𝑅 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠\n+ 𝛽𝛽6 𝑆𝑆𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠 𝑓𝑓𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝 𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑅𝑅𝑔𝑔𝑅𝑅𝐻𝐻𝑠𝑠 𝑏𝑏𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅 2012\nEach of the model's variab+le s𝛽𝛽 m7 a𝑆𝑆y𝑔𝑔 e𝑅𝑅x𝑔𝑔h𝑅𝑅i b𝑅𝑅i𝑂𝑂t i𝐻𝐻nd𝐻𝐻ic𝑅𝑅a𝑅𝑅t𝑠𝑠io 𝑓𝑓n𝐻𝐻s 𝑝𝑝o f𝐻𝐻 in𝑝𝑝f𝑅𝑅l𝑔𝑔a𝑅𝑅t𝑠𝑠ed𝑅𝑅 𝑔𝑔a𝑅𝑅p𝐻𝐻p𝑠𝑠ra 𝑅𝑅is𝑓𝑓a𝑔𝑔ls𝑅𝑅, 𝑝𝑝w 2h0ic1h2 c o+ul d𝛽𝛽 b8 e 𝐿𝐿 i𝑇𝑇nd𝐿𝐿ic 𝑅𝑅a𝑔𝑔ti v𝐻𝐻e𝑝𝑝 𝑅𝑅o𝑔𝑔f 𝑅𝑅f𝑠𝑠ra𝑅𝑅u𝑔𝑔d𝑅𝑅u𝐻𝐻l𝑠𝑠en+t a p𝜀𝜀praisal\npractices. Existing literature has highlighted that fraudulent appraisals tend to elevate the risk of loan default. Given that\nthe dataset employed in our research comprises loans that have all undergone foreclosure proceedings, it is anticipated\nthat the model will reveal a heightened prevalence of indicators associated with fraudulent appraisal practices.\nTo address the issue of inflated property appraisals, Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) and the Federal Housing\nFinance Agency (FHFA) introduced the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC) as part of the Dodd-Frank regulations.\nHVCC aimed to enhance the accuracy of property appraisals by creating a clear separation between appraisers and lenders,\nthereby reducing the potential for undue influence by lenders.\nThe impact of HVCC is evident when we examine the difference between the actual home prices realized from the time of\norigination to liquidation for loans originated before and after 2012. Notably, for loans originated before 2012, there was\na significant 46% reduction in realized prices compared to for loans originated after 2012, the reduction was 28%. This\n18% disparity suggests that inflated appraisals were more prevalent in loans issued prior to 2012. The model is trying to\nexplain the drop in home values from origination date (measured as appraised value) till the liquidation date (which is the\nsales value of the property at liquidation)\nMoreover, this disparity in price reductions varies across different states captured by state dummies in the model, as\ndepicted in Figure 1. For example, in Florida, loans originated before 2012 showed around 14% higher haircut (after\ncontrolling HPI changes) relative to loans originated after 2012. Notably, states like Florida (FL), Arizona (AZ), California\n(CA), and Nevada (NV) experienced the most substantial changes in price reductions after the implementation of HVCC.\nThese states were also the epicenters of the subprime mortgage bubble during the Great Recession.\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nFL AZ SC PR RI IA IN CO MI ID MDOR VT TN NE KYMONYNMKS MS LA CT MTME HI VI\n-2\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS 5 Uncovering Deceptive Practices\nstucriah\nneewteb\necnereffiD\nerofeb\ndetanigiro\nsnaol\nrof\n2102\nretfa\ndna\nFigure 1: Difference change in haircuts for loans originated before and after 2012\nStatesThe model indicates a clear positive correlation between realized home price changes and the original Loan-to-Value ratio\n(LTV). While home price change and LTV seems to be irrelevant but his relationship exhibits statistical significance,\nparticularly demonstrating a notably steeper impact around the 80% LTV mark. It suggests that liquidated loans with lower\nLTVs that ended up with foreclosure might have experienced a higher incidence of fraudulent activities leading to defaults.\nThis relationship is depicted in Figure 2.\nMoreover, other studies have highlighted potential fraud instances, such as the underreporting of secondary liens, falsely\ncategorized as primary liens within the loan records. This misrepresentation could mislead lenders and investors. Notably,\nthe abrupt change observed at the 80% LTV threshold suggests a deliberate adjustment of many loans to reduce LTV\nvalues, possibly to evade mandatory mortgage insurance payments or receiving a higher mortgage rate.\n0\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50\n-60\n-70\n-80\nCredit score is another variable that exhibits a significant statistical association with realized changes in home prices. In\nFigure 3, we present a comparison of actual and predicted home price changes in relation to the credit score at the time\nof origination. Notably, subprime borrowers experience a more substantial decline in home prices, which is attributed to a\ngreater prevalence of fraudulent activities and overinflated appraisals during the origination process.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS 6 Uncovering Deceptive Practices\nnoitanigiro\necnis\negnahc\necirp\nemoH\nOriginal LTV\n-40\n500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850\n-42\n-44\n-46\n-48\n-50\n-52\n-54\n-56\nnoitanigiro\necnis\negnahc\necirp\nemoH\nFigure 2: Realized home price change versus original LTV\nFigure 3: Realized home price change versus original FICO score\nCredit score at origination\nActual\nPredictedAnother significant variable supporting the findings of various researchers is the loan purpose. It has been observed that\nmortgages intended for refinancing existing loans carry a higher risk of fraudulent activity. The model indicates that loans\naimed at rate refinancing exhibit a 5.4% greater discrepancy in their appraisal values compared to loans intended for\nproperty purchase. This discrepancy is attributed to the fact that loans for property purchase are associated with a specific\npurchase price, making it more challenging to inflate the property's appraisal.\nMoreover, loans for cash-out refinancing demonstrate an even higher appraisal discrepancy, standing at 7.8% when\ncompared to purchase loans. This heightened difference in appraisal values can be attributed to the incentive for borrowers\nto seek higher appraisals in order to extract more money from their homes during a cash-out refinancing.\nWithin the realm of property types, it's noteworthy that loans utilized for purchasing manufactured housing have\nexperienced a 10% greater decline in home prices compared to single-house properties. This disparity could potentially be\nattributed to the elevated depreciation rates associated with manufactured housing. Furthermore, the practice of\nincorporating land value into the property valuation, particularly when the land is not owned by the borrowers, may serve\nas an additional potential avenue for fraudulent activity. In summary, it is apparent that manufactured housing presents a\nheightened risk of inflated property appraisals when compared to other property types.\nDifferences in occupancy types have revealed varying impacts on home prices. Investment properties experienced a more\nsubstantial decline in home values, approximately 10% lower than owner-occupied homes. Second homes also saw a\nnotable decrease, with prices falling 4% more than owner-occupied residences. This suggests that investment properties\nwere at a greater risk of having inflated appraisals, while second homes also exhibited elevated risk levels. These particular\nmarket segments exhibit a heightened level of risk in the real estate market.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS 7 Uncovering Deceptive Practices3 CONCLUSION\nThis research delves into the factors influencing changes in home prices, particularly focusing on variables indicative of\ninflated property appraisals and fraudulent practices. To conduct this analysis, a dataset comprising liquidated homes from\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is utilized. It is important to note that the reported sales prices in this dataset\nare considered a reasonably accurate representation of property values.\nDespite post-Great Recession regulatory actions and anti-fraud initiatives, the data reveals that the incidence of fraudulent\nactivities has decreased, yet not been entirely eradicated. Among the key variables under examination, Loan-to-Value (LTV)\nratios, which hinge on property appraisals, stand out as a primary measure of borrowers' credit risk. These ratios play a\npivotal role in credit risk modeling. However, a biased or inaccurate LTV can result in an overestimation of credit losses for\nboth lenders and portfolio managers.\nCredit risk models should carefully account for indicators that suggest an elevated risk of fraud. Variables such as occupancy\ntypes, property classifications, and credit scores serve as key indicators of potential inflated appraisals, thereby increasing\nthe likelihood of default. These factors are systematically assessed and quantified in Moody's Mortgage Portfolio Analyzer,\nensuring a comprehensive evaluation of their impact on credit risk within mortgage portfolios.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS 8 Uncovering Deceptive Practices4 REFERENCES\nAgarwal, Sumit, Itzhak Ben-David, and Vincent Yao, 2015, Collateral valuation and borrower financial constraints: Evidence\nfrom the residential real estate market, Management Science 61, 2220–2240\nBen-David, Itzhak, 2011, Financial constraints and inflated home prices during the real estate boom, American Economic\nJournal: Applied Economics 3, 55–87.\nCarrillo, Paul E., 2013, Testing for fraud in the residential mortgage market: How much did early-payment-defaults overpay\nfor housing?, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics 47, 36–64.\nCho, Man, and Isaac F.
