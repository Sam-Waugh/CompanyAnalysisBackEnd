Introduction\nThe topic of ESG is omnipresent in the world of business and finance today. There are currently more than $35 trillion assets under\nmanagement in sustainable investments.1 Executive pay is being tied to ESG performance.2 Firms are being held responsible for the\nESG quality of their supply chains.3 In the age of social media, ESG-related events can reach a global audience overnight.\nThe moral component of ESG is certainly a strong argument for its relevance. Yet, many business and finance decision makers are\ntasked with a focus on more tangible outcomes in their day-to-day work, and it is not always clear why they should care about\nESG. How does ESG actually affect the metrics that they are responsible for?\nIn this paper, we show that ESG performance is very relevant for firms’ financial results and value. While this may not be a surprise\nfor global events (such as the Volkswagen emissions scandal), our study is broad-based, taking into account 13,000+ ESG events\n(“controversies”) worldwide collected by Moody’s ESG Solutions. Measuring ESG performance using a Controversy Frequency\nScore (CFS) varying between 0 and 100, based on the events a firm experienced over the past two years, we find that a\ndeterioration in performance driven by an increase in controversies is significantly related to stock market losses, both in the short-\nrun and over a return horizon of one year.\nThe effects we find range from meaningful for events that happen rather frequently, to dramatic for the most severe, rarer events.\nHaving at least one ESG controversy of any kind during a given month leads to an abnormal stock return (measured using a\nmarket model) of −0.37% over two months. Monthly increases in the CFS by 30 or more points generate statistically significant\nabnormal returns of −0.91% over two months, and −1.88% over twelve months. CFS jumps of this magnitude occur 1,732 times in\nour sample of 3,468 firms, so that, statistically, over half of firms are affected once during our analysis period January 2015 to\nJanuary 2019. Overall, moderate to severe ESG events generate abnormal stock market losses of −1.3% to −7.5% over twelve\nmonths. With the median market capitalization of firms in our sample at $11.7 billion, the typical dollar value lost over one year is\napproximately $400 million.\nIn addition to the analysis based on Moody’s ESG Controversies, we also run tests using data provided by RepRisk, a Swiss ESG\nanalytics firm. RepRisk calculates a score, the RepRisk Index (RRI), based on ESG incidents that they gather. The results reported in\nthe Appendix confirm the strong relationship between ESG performance and stock returns over a horizon up to one year.\nWe also investigate whether a firm’s prior ESG performance history has a bearing on our results. Large deteriorations in the\nControversy Frequency Score occur more frequently for firms with few or no recent events recorded about them, because\nsubsequent events do gradually less to raise the CFS. We find that firms with existing ESG concerns (CFS > 0) are less vulnerable\nto losses from ESG events, controlling for the degree of performance deterioration. Stock investors seem to be pricing further\nevents in for firms with a known ESG history, which remains in line with findings by Pineiro et.al (2021), that there is persistence in\nESG incidents.\nWhile there are differences in overall controversy rates across sectors, sizeable CFS jumps occur in all of them. However, we find\nvariation in the impact on stock returns. In Construction, Consumer Products, Energy & Natural Resources, and Finance, firms\nsuffer large negative abnormal returns over twelve months, ranging from −3.17% to −5.72%. We also find evidence of a negative\nvalue impact in Business Products, Utilities, Hi-Tech, and Trade, but, in the remaining sectors, there is little measurable effect of\nCFS increases.\nThe Controversy Frequency Score that we create summarizes controversies a firm has experienced during the past two years into a\nquantitative measure of the current ESG performance of a firm. ESG controversies are outcomes influenced both by the exposure\nof a firm to ESG risk as well as their ESG policies, and thus represent a direct measure of ESG performance.4 The construction of\nthe score is based on a number of intuitive principles, such as that more recent and more severe controversies receive a higher\n1 https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/esg-assets-rising-to-50-trillion-will-reshape-140-5-trillion-of-global-aum-by-2025-finds-bloomberg-\nintelligence/\n2 https://www.ft.com/content/b1bb86d9-40c1-44c1-86b2-11a57c9cbc49\n3 https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2021/07/overview-of-the-german-supply-chain-due-diligence-act\n4 Pineiro et.al. (2022) show that by adopting ESG policies, firms can influence the number of ESG controversies that they suffer.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 3weight, and that the marginal contribution of events is decreasing. Our key use case of the CFS in this paper is measuring\ndeteriorations in ESG performance.\nESG events can affect firm value through a number of channels. A firm’s balance sheet can be directly affected if an event involves\nproperty destruction or a fine. Many events entail costs, such as a product recall or a labor dispute involving a strike. Reputation\ncan play a role, both with customers lowering demand for the firm’s products, as well as with possible business partners reducing\nthe firm’s opportunities. Finally, market value can also be affected if morally-minded investors sell the stock.\nVarious approaches can be employed to create a quantitative score based on information regarding a firm’s ESG events. For the\nControversy Frequency Score, we use a weighted moving average (WMA) approach, taking into account events going back a fixed\ntime interval and weighting recent events more strongly. WMA is a standard technique in quantitative finance, with applications\nincluding technical analysis and volatility modeling. Other quantitative scoring approaches include statistical models to predict\nfuture ESG events (see Pineiro et.al. (2022)) or event count-based measures.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After a review of the literature in Section 2, we discuss the Moody’s ESG\ncontroversies data in Section 3, and the event study methodology and our equity return data in Section 4. In Section 5, we\ninvestigate the stock market effects of individual ESG controversies, independent of firms’ ESG history. In Section 6, we introduce\nthe Controversy Frequency Score, before employing changes in the score as a measure of ESG performance deterioration in event\nstudies in Section 7. Section 8 concludes. In the Appendix, we present an analysis using RepRisk incidents data.\n2. Literature Review and Contribution\nVarious questions around the relationship between ESG and business outcomes have been studied in the literature. These include:\nDoes a portfolio constructed using ESG criteria generate alpha? Glossner (2018) shows this to be true for a portfolio of high-risk\nfirms. Serafeim (2018) finds significant alpha for a factor that goes long on firms with good ESG performance and negative\nsentiment momentum. Are firms with good ESG risk management more successful? Khan, Serafeim, and Yoon (2015) show that\nfirms with strong performance on ESG criteria material to their business have superior stock returns. Eccles, Ioannou, Serafeim\n(2014) show that firms who adopted ESG policies early on did well in the long run. Is ESG performance relevant for a firm’s credit\nrisk? Devalle, Fiandrino, and Cantino (2017) show a positive effect on credit ratings for social and governance issues, but not for\nenvironmental ones.\nThere are a few papers which, like ours, focus on identifying the effects of ESG events on firm value. Krueger (2015), the work most\nsimilar to ours, uses ESG events based on public sources like news or NGO reports. In an event study of abnormal returns\ncalculated with a market model, he finds an average effect of −1.3% over 21 days. Events are classified into six categories, and\nKrueger finds the biggest effects (over −3%) for the stakeholder issues Community and Environment, smaller ones for Product and\nEmployee Relations, and none for Human Rights and Diversity. Finally, he calculates the median cost over the 1,500 events studied\nto be $76m. Another closely related paper is Lundgren and Olsson (2010), who study abnormal stock returns around\nenvironmental events, and find significant effects for European firms. Glossner (2018), even though the main focus of his paper is\nalpha, also provides evidence of the negative direct stock market effect of ESG events, with magnitudes similar to our findings\nbelow. La Torre, et.al. (2020) run firm-level monthly time-series regression of stock returns on changes in components of the “ESG\nOverall” score. They find significant relationships only for a small number of the 47 firms that they study, often in the energy and\nutilities sectors. Finally, Frooman (1997) in a meta-analysis of 27 studies reports that “illegal and illicit behavior” shifts abnormal\nreturns by a full standard deviation.\nOur present paper extends the literature in a couple of dimensions. In contrast to previous papers, we study the return impact of\nESG events over a horizon of up to one year. We consider effects across different event qualities, ranging from “smaller” to the\nmost serious, rare events. Last, our study is conducted on a global sample covering the majority of existing listed firms. While\nthere is general agreement that ESG events can have a negative effect on shareholder value, open questions remain regarding how\nmuch damage which type of event does, over what time horizon, whether the effect is persistent, and which firms are most\nstrongly affected. By quantifying the effects that ESG events can have on shareholder value along various dimensions, we aim to\nprovide answers to these questions.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 43. ESG Controversies Data\n3.1 Moody’s ESG Solutions Controversies\nMoody’s ESG Solutions is a business unit of Moody’s Corporation that serves the growing global demand for ESG and climate\ninsights. Moody’s identifies companies’ involvements in ESG controversies, defined as public information or contradictory opinions\nfrom reliable sources that incriminate or make allegations against an issuer regarding how it handles ESG issues. Each controversy\nmay relate to several facts or events, to their conflicting interpretations, legal procedures or non-proven claims. Moody’s screens a\npre-defined population of companies on a daily basis, currently covering 10,000+ companies regarding their involvement in ESG\ncontroversies across 38 ESG issues. The dataset currently contains over 22,000 entries with coverage going back to 2007.\nMoody’s identifies controversies from a daily newsfeed that includes company sources, news, and stakeholder sources. Potential\ncontroversies are evaluated for their impacts on both companies and stakeholders. Once identified, each controversy is classified\nregarding severity and responsiveness. Severity is defined based on the scale, the scope, and the remedial/irremediable nature of\nthe controversy for both stakeholders and companies, and possible values are “Minor,” “Significant,” “High,” and “Critical.”\nResponsiveness refers to a firm’s reaction to a specific event, including measures to remedy the specific case and prevent\nreoccurrence in the future, with possible values “Proactive,” “Remediative,” “Reactive,” “Non-communicative.” The research team\nmonitors each controversy’s evolution and provides updates about significant developments.\nIn addition to firm name and identifier, date, severity, and responsiveness, the dataset contains the following information about\neach controversy:\n» Title (usually one sentence)\n» Description (usually multiple paragraphs)\n» Sources (publication name, date, title)\n» Location (list of countries)\n» Related topics (combination of E, S, and G)\n» Related detailed topics (combination from list of 171 topics)\nWhenever Moody’s provides updates to a controversy, there are multiple entries in the database for the same controversy\nidentifier. For our analysis, we use the first entry for each controversy by date, with a tie-breaking logic for the rare event of two\nentries on the earliest date. Our final dataset contains 22,253 controversies for 3,486 firms between January 2008 and October\n2021. Figure 1 shows the distribution by year.\nFigure 1 Distribution of ESG controversies over time\nNote: Controversies are dated by the first related entry in Moody’s ESG Solutions’ database.\n3.2 Selected Controversies\nControversies encompass a broad range of different events connected by the common theme of ESG, which we view as inclusive\nof any issues impacting a firm’s stakeholders. By their nature, some controversies have a more direct relationship to a firm’s equity\nholders than others. For example, a plant explosion constitutes a destruction of value, and a levied regulatory fine constitutes a\ncash outflow. Whereas an alleged water well contamination or a union’s petition to address unhealthy working conditions may\nultimately result in costs to the firm, but these are less direct. Our aim is to test the hypothesis that controversies of the former\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 5kind have a greater impact on firm value than the latter. We are not aware of an accepted classification of ESG events with respect\nto their “financial relevance” and expected negative impact on shareholders.\nMoody’s assigns related topics to each controversy out of a list of 171 possible topics. To test our hypothesis, we classify these\ntopics in an ad-hoc way based on our intuition into two groups, “direct financial impact” and “indirect financial impact.” Our\napproach is based on the assumption that for a large number of these topics such a categorization will be rather obvious. We\nbelieve that most people would understand that “Fraud” or “Product Recall” are directly financially relevant, while “Impact on\nBiodiversity” or “Damages for Local Employment” may have a more indirect financial impact. If our assumption is true, then an\nintuition-based distinction will generate a meaningful classification and allow us to test our hypothesis, even if for a number of\ntopics the classification is debatable.\n4. Event Study Methodology and Stock Return Data\nIn order to measure the effects of ESG-related events on firm value, we conduct event studies using firms’ abnormal stock market\nreturns. This approach is well-established in financial econometrics (see e.g. Campbell, Lo, MacKinlay (1997)). Stock market value is\na forward-looking measure that gauges firm value in real time, making it suitable for event studies, since it allows good association\nbetween timed events and firm value, limiting the effects of confounding factors. Furthermore, event studies rely on a\nsophisticated and well-established theoretical machinery that produces expected equity returns, against which observed value\nchanges can be compared.\n4.1 Abnormal Returns\nIn a factor model, the expected return of a firm is a function of its exposures, or betas, to systematic risk factors. In this paper, we\nwork with the so-called market model (see MacKinlay (1997)), which has as only risk factor, the overall market return (termed\nin the following). We match the market factor to the location of the headquarters of the firm by region.5\n𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀\nWe conduct our analysis monthly, and we estimate the parameters in rolling 60-month regressions. A firm’s exposure to the\nmarket factor will thus vary from one month to the next. Specifically, firm ’s exposure at time , , is estimated using individual\nstock returns and factor observations in periods in the time-series regression\n𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖\n𝑅𝑅 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝜏𝜏=𝑡𝑡−60,…,𝑡𝑡−1\n𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖.\nAll returns are log returns, and the regressions are estimated using OLS, requiring a minimum of 30 observations.\nAbnormal returns are then calculated “out-of-sample” as the difference between a firm’s stock return and its expected value,\ncalculated using the ex-post realized market return and estimated coefficients. Following each rolling estimation window, returns\nare calculated for multiple subsequent months using the same estimated exposures. Specifically, we calculate the abnormal return\nin each period as follows:\n𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡+1,𝑡𝑡+2,…\n𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥 =𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥−�𝛼𝛼�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽̂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥�, for 𝑥𝑥 =0,1,2,…\nwhere and are the estimated coefficients. The subscript refers to the return from the start to the end of month ,\ne.g., is the abnormal return of firm in the third month after the end of the estimation period.\n𝛼𝛼� 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝑡𝑡+𝑥𝑥 𝑡𝑡+𝑥𝑥\n𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+2 𝑖𝑖\nCumulative abnormal returns (CAR) are obtained by adding up over multiple months, e.g. the three-month return from to\nis\n𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡+2\n𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+2 = 𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+1+𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+2\n5 The market return time series were obtained from Kenneth French’s website, which distinguishes between five regions: North America, Europe, Japan, APAC\nex Japan, Emerging markets.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 6Where, for a given CAR, only one set of estimated exposure parameters is used, namely the ones estimated using observations\nuntil the month prior to the return period.\nWe incorporate an adjustment to abnormal returns to ensure that they have an overall mean of zero in our sample. To achieve\nthis, we subtract, at each return horizon, the overall mean CAR across the entire sample (or for size and sector groups), so that we\nhave\n∗\n𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥 = 𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥−�𝐶𝐶��𝐴𝐴��𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥\nIn the following, we will always be working with , which, for convenience, we simply refer to as “abnormal returns.”\n∗\n𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅\n4.2 Statistical Tests\nOur tests of statistical significance use standard errors around the average cumulative abnormal returns, where the average is\nalways taken over returns that follow a certain type of event (to be defined below). Specifically, we look at returns from the\nbeginning of the month in which an event occurs over a holding period of up to 12 months, and then calculate averages of\ncumulative abnormal returns (ACAR). The standard error for a given ACAR is calculated as\n𝑥𝑥 2\n𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 =� 2 �𝜎𝜎�𝑖𝑖 ,\n𝑁𝑁 𝑖𝑖\nwhere is the return horizon, is the number of firm-months in which events are observed, and is the estimated variance in\nthe rolling regression used for the cumulative return starting in firm-month . Standard errors thus ac2count for the estimated\nvolatilit𝑥𝑥y of each firm contribu𝑁𝑁ting to the average. The t-statisti𝑖𝑖c for the test of an ACAR is 𝜎𝜎�𝑖𝑖\n𝑖𝑖\n∗\n𝐶𝐶��𝐴𝐴���𝑅𝑅��\n𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = ,\n𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴\nwhere is the average adjusted CAR, as discussed above.\n∗\n𝐶𝐶��𝐴𝐴���𝑅𝑅��\n4.3 Stock Return Data\nWe include in our empirical analysis all publicly listed firms that had a controversy since January 1, 2008.6 We obtain monthly\ninformation on firms’ equity returns, total assets, sector, and country of headquarters from Moody’s Analytics public firm\ndatabase, as well as region-matched stock index returns from Kenneth French’s website.\nAll returns used in this study are log returns, and firm-level monthly raw equity returns are winsorized at . The rolling\ntime-series regressions for the market model are estimated every month, generating a new set of intercepts and exposures\nwhenever sufficient data for a firm is available. With each set of estimated parameters, we calculate cum±ulalotigve(2 a)bnormal returns\nover 1 to 12 months following the estimation period. We exclude observations in the 12 months after a default event. Our final\ndataset contains all firm-month observations with available 12-month abnormal return starting in the period, which are 147,731\nobservations for 3,486 firms spanning the period January 2015 to December 2019.\n4.4 Return Statistics\nIn our event studies, we investigate both the short-run effect of ESG events (two-month return), as well as the long-run effect (12-\nmonth return). Table 1 documents the overall return distributions for the two horizons. Both returns are constructed to have a\nmean of zero across the entire sample (compare Section 4.1).\n6 We are not taking into account firms that were in principle covered by Moody’s ESG Solutions but never had an incident. This is not an issue, because the\nabnormal returns methodology compares realized returns against a firm-specific expected return.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 7Table 1 Statistics on full-sample average cumulative abnormal log-returns\nMINIMUM PERCENTILE MAXIMUM MEAN\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nMoments of 2-month abnormal returns\n-1.42% -0.14% -0.08% -0.05% -0.02% 0.00% 0.02% 0.05% 0.08% 0.14% 1.43% 0.00%\nMoments of 12-month abnormal returns\n-4.12% -0.39% -0.23% -0.13% -0.06% 0.01% 0.07% 0.14% 0.23% 0.38% 3.95% 0.00%\nNote: Based on the final sample of 147,731 observations January 2015 to December 2019.\n5. The Value Impact of Individual Controversies\nIn this section, we study the business impact of ESG controversies directly by using monthly controversy counts by severity and\nresponsiveness as input to our event study methodology. In particular, our tests are independent of the previous ESG controversies\nthat a firm may have experienced. We also define event counts for E, S, and G controversies separately, where a controversy is\nincluded if its topics include the respective one (so that a given controversy may be included for multiple topics).\nWe focus on abnormal returns over a horizon of 2 months to measure the short-run impact of controversies, and of 12 months to\nmeasure the long-run, persistent impact. In both cases, the return period starts in the event month. We use two months for the\nshort-term impact to allow some time for details to emerge and for any stock market overreaction to fade.\n5.1 Short-Run Effects\nWe find that ESG events lead to significantly negative returns in the short-run (Table 2 and Figure 2). If an ESG event of any kind\noccurs, firms, on average, experience a statistically significant abnormal return of −0.37% over two months. During our sample\nperiod, this happens in 7,670 firm-months. The effect is generally greater the more events occur, at −0.73% for two or more, and\n−1.40% for four or more controversies.\nTable 2 Average 2-month abnormal returns.\nPanel A.

Panel B requires at least one event (with any responsiveness) in a month.\nLooking at E, S, and G events separately we observe differences. Even though always negative, average abnormal returns for E and\nG are quite small and not statistically significant. In contrast, the effect of S controversies is large and statistically significant. Firms\nthat experience three or more S events in a month have an average abnormal return of −2.11%.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 8Figure 2 also shows results using selected controversies (see Section 3.2). In most cases, the negative average abnormal returns are\naround 40% larger when only considering selected controversies. E.g., the effect of having at least one selected controversy in a\nmonth is −0.62%.\nWe also investigate the role of controversy characteristics. While effects are largely independent of responsiveness (unreported), a\nhigher severity is associated with lower returns. E.g., having an event of the highest severity on average leads to an abnormal\nreturn of −1.39%. The effect is most pronounced for S controversies, where having an event of the highest severity (4 = critical)\nleads to an average 2-month loss of −6.36%.\nFigure 2 Average 2-month abnormal returns.\nPanel A.\nPanel B.\nNote: We require a minimum of 20 firm-month observations in each group (thus missing bars).\n5.2 Long-Run Effects\nStock markets often quickly react to news. As more time passes, more information is revealed, and assessment of the impact of a\ncontroversy is updated. Even if in the short-run a given stock suffers a negative impact, there may be no difference in the long-run,\nbecause effects fade or are small relative to other value-relevant factors. In order to test whether ESG controversies have a\nnegative effect on stocks beyond the short-run reaction, we investigate abnormal returns over a period of one year (Table 3 and\nFigure 3).\nWe find persistent negative valuation effects, when multiple ESG controversies occur. If three or more controversies occur in a\nmonth, firms on average have an abnormal return of −1.18% over one year. For five or more controversies, losses are −6.47%.\nLarge losses are observed for G and S events. Controversies selected for their expected strong financial impact (see Section 3.2)\nindeed lead to more negative abnormal returns.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 9In contrast to the short-run, results over a one-year horizon do not show worse abnormal returns for higher severity (Panel B in\nFigure 3). A possible explanation for this finding is that firms that experience a controversy of the highest severity often have a\nhistory of previous ESG controversies, which may be muting the stock return impact. In our sample, when a firm experiences a\ncritical (highest severity) controversy, the median number of previous controversies it has had is more than double compared to\nthe case when a controversy with lower severity occurs. Furthermore, firms in our sample that ever experience a controversy with\nseverity “high” or “critical” have more than five times as many controversies per period overall (0.11), compared with all other\nfirms (0.02). In order to account for these factors, we study the valuation effects of ESG controversies considering firms’ ESG\nhistory in Section 7.\nTable 3 Average 12-month abnormal returns.\nPanel A.

Using Events to Measure ESG Performance: A Controversy Frequency Score (CFS)\nA company’s occurrence of ESG controversies reflects both the ESG risk exposure from its area of activity (industry, geography,\netc.), as well as its ESG culture and policies aimed at mitigating these risks. We define ESG risks as negative effects of ESG\ncontroversies on a firm’s financial performance and economic value. The frequency and characteristics of controversies represent\ntangible outcomes that can be used to assess firms. We aggregate the information about a company’s recent ESG controversies\ninto a score, the Controversy Frequency Score (CFS), which measures the company’s current ESG performance.\nThe CFS is calculated daily on the individual-firm level, and calibrated to vary between 0 (optimal performance characterized by no\nrecent controversies) and 100. The score’s construction is guided by the following key considerations, each of which discussed in\ndetail below: 1) Controversies that occurred longer ago are less relevant for the current performance assessment, 2) Controversies\nwith higher severity and lower responsiveness have greater influence on measured ESG performance, and 3) The marginal effect of\nevents on performance is decreasing.\n6.1 Construction of the CFS\nThe core logic employed in constructing the CFS is expressed in the equation below. Individual controversies are assigned an event\nscore based on their characteristics. The scores of all controversies on a given day are added up, and the sum is discounted based\non the time period between the event day and the current score date. Summing up the discounted day scores produces a “raw”\nscore, which is then transformed into the CFS using a concave function, incorporating the idea that events contribute less, the\nmore (current and prior) events the firm has had.\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆(𝑀𝑀)=𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡� � 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡(𝑡𝑡)⋅� � 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒(𝑑𝑑) ��\n𝐷𝐷𝑎𝑎𝐷𝐷𝐶𝐶 𝑖𝑖 𝑓𝑓𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑓𝑓 𝑇𝑇−730 𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶 𝑇𝑇) 𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑐𝑐 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖\n6.1.1 Controversy Characteristics\nWe assign a score to individual controversies based on their severity and responsiveness provided in our data. Intuitively, both\nthese characteristics are relevant for measuring ESG performance. Severity directly measures an event’s scale and scope, but the\nultimate impact on the firm, on its stakeholders, and on third parties is also affected by the firm’s response and subsequent\nbehavior.\nMoody’s evaluates both severity and responsiveness on 4-degree scales. We use the numerical representation from 1 to 4, with 4\nbeing the worst. We experimented with different ways of combining the two characteristics into an event score (sum, product,\ntransformations, severity only), and ultimately found that applying a square root transformation to both factors works well.\n𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 =�𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 . 𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 11The concave transform attenuates the effect of characteristics relative to the number of controversies, in line with the findings in\nSection 5.\n6.1.2 Time Discounting\nWe need to decide on the shape and time span of the discounting function. Convex discounting is appropriate, since it ensures\nthat changes in measured performance will primarily arise due to new controversies, rather than from old controversies “dropping\nout.” The speed of discounting aims to strike a balance between not ignoring relevant information (by discounting too quickly, e.g.,\nignoring controversies more than six months ago) and missing to detect changes in firms’ ESG risk exposure and culture over time\n(by discounting too slowly). We opt for a maximum relevance of two years, based on internal research regarding the time it takes\nfor firm policy changes to affect controversy numbers. Panel A in Figure 4 illustrates the discount function.\nFigure 4 CFS construction: Discount function and final transformation.\nPanel A. Discount function. Panel B. Final transformation.\n6.1.3 Decreasing Marginal Contribution\nWe design the CFS to be concave in events, meaning that the score increase (i.e., performance deterioration) resulting from a\ncontroversy with given characteristics will be smaller if the firm has more (previous or concurrent) other controversies. This setup\nis intuitive, because an event should affect the ESG risk assessment more strongly if it is a first for the firm, than if the firm has had\na hundred or more prior controversies.\nConcavity is achieved through the final transformation, which quantifies the marginal contribution of additional controversies. We\ncalibrate it so that a number of simple quantitative relationships hold:\n» If a firm’s first event (in two years) is lightest (severity = responsiveness = 1), then the CFS jumps from 0 to 24\n» If a firm’s first event (in two years) is gravest (severity = responsiveness = 4), then the CFS jumps from 0 to 40\n» If a firm has three gravest controversies (first in two years), then the CFS jumps from 0 to 59\nPanel B of Figure 4 shows the final transform.\n6.2 Distribution of the CFS\nAs discussed in Section 3, Moody’s controversy coverage is strong, with more than 1,500 controversies reported on per year since\n2013. As the CFS takes into account events going back up to two year, we calculate CFS values starting in December 2014. In order\nto remain in line with our returns, which exclude the Covid period, in the following study, we document CFS until January 2019.\nWe also exclude CFS values for firms that defaulted up to one year before the CFS month.\nTable 4 documents the distribution of CFS. In over one half of firm-months the score is 0, meaning that firms did not have any\ncontroversy recorded in the two years prior.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 12Table 4 Distribution of Controversy Frequency Scores, percentiles.\nMINIMUM 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% MAXIMUM\n0 0 0 0 0 0 10 20 28 36 91\nNote: An observation is a firm-month. The period considered is January 2015 to January 2019.\n6.3 Average CFS Values by Size and Sector\nPanel A of Table 5 documents average CFS values by size quartiles (formed on year-month book assets in USD), and shows that\naverage CFS levels vary strongly with size, indicating a poorer overall ESG performance by large firms. This finding is driven by the\ngreater number of ESG controversies for large firms in our database. There are several reasons for this pattern. Large firms receive a\ngreater public interest because are better known, and therefore receive more coverage. Events concerning large firms also have a\ngreater extent on average, making them more noteworthy. It is debatable whether more recorded events of large firms are an\naccurate reflection of the poorer ESG performance of these companies, or whether it is a data and measurement artifact that\nshould be remedied, e.g., by measuring performance relative to similar-sized peers.\nTable 5 Average CFS by size and sector.\nPanel A.

Average CFS values range from 8.3\nin Agriculture to 15.2 for Utilities. As Panel B of Table 5 indicates, some of this variation is related to differences in firm size.\n7. Stock Price Effects of a Deterioration in ESG Performance\nWe employ our Controversy Frequency Score to investigate the stock price effects of deteriorations in ESG performance in the\nevent-study framework of Section 4, with events defined as monthly increases in the CFS by different thresholds. The approach\nresembles the controversy count studies in Section 5, in that events are driven by the controversies that a firm experiences over a\nmonth, but it differs, as using changes in CFS take into account firms’ ESG histories.\nAfter describing the data characteristics of CFS changes, we present results using the full sample. We then explore the dependence\nof our findings on the start-of-month CFS level, which reflects previous ESG events a firm has experienced. We also present results\nwithin specific groups of firms, focusing on size and sector as two important dimensions.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 137.1 The distribution of CFS Changes\nFigure 6 documents the distribution of monthly changes in CFS for our sample between January 2015 and January 2019.\nFigure 5 Distribution of changes in the Controversy Frequency Score.\nNote: Based on 147,731 firm-months of 3,486 firms during the period February 2015 to January 2019.\n7.2 Changes in CFS and Abnormal Returns\nTable 6 and Figure 7 present average cumulative abnormal returns, measured starting in the month when a change in the CFS\nhappens, and extending over a period of up to twelve months. We look at a range of successively higher thresholds for CFS\nchanges. The dominant pattern in the results is that increases in CFS are associated with negative abnormal returns, and that\nreturns are more negative the larger the CFS jump. Furthermore, for CFS increase thresholds of 15 points or higher, stock losses\ngrow bigger with return horizon. At the 12-month horizon, the effects we find range from −1.15% for CFS jumps of 15 or more, to\n−11.74% for jumps of 44 or more.\nAs a benchmark, we focus on CFS increases of 30 or more. Such events happen 1,732 times in our dataset, thus statistically\naffecting over half of firms in our sample once over the sample period January 2015–January 2019. Starting in firm-months when\nthe CFS goes up by at least 30 points, 2-month abnormal returns are on average −0.91%, and the average 12-month return is\n−1.88%, both of which are statistically significant. Given that the median market capitalization of firms in our sample when such\nan event occurs is $11.1bn (compared to $11.7bn overall), this implies a value loss of $208m over one year, representing a sizeable\neffect. For moderate to severe ESG events generating abnormal stock market losses of −1.3% to −7.5% over twelve months, the\ntypical dollar value lost is approximately $400 million.\nLarge CFS increases occur across firms with all characteristics. As we show below, the 1,732 increases by 30 or more points are\nalmost equally distributed across size quartiles, and they are broadly distributed across all sectors and geographic regions.\nTable 6 Monthly CFS increases and returns, full sample.\nCFS INCREASE N AVG 2-M RETURN T-STAT AVG 12-M RETURN T-STAT\nor more 6,778 -0.39% -2.86 0.23% 0.70\n5 or more 5,675 -0.43% -2.83 0.21% 0.55\n10 or more 3,940 -0.53% -2.79 -0.36% -0.78\n15 or more 2,870 -0.64% -2.85 -1.13% -2.04\n20 or more 2,342 -0.77% -3.02 -1.30% -2.10\n30 or more 1,732 -0.91% -3.02 -1.88% -2.55\n35 or more 874 -1.08% -2.49 -1.74% -1.63\n36 or more 475 -1.10% -1.79 -1.83% -1.22\n37 or more 257 -1.69% -2.14 -4.13% -2.13\n38 or more 166 -1.58% -1.64 -7.51% -3.18\n40 or more 51 -0.73% -0.44 -5.24% -1.29\n42 or more 39 -1.73% -0.89 -5.36% -1.13\n44 or more 28 -5.21% -2.34 -11.73% -2.15\nNote: Returns are average cumulative abnormal returns. We require a minimum of 20 firm-month observations in each group.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 14Figure 6 Monthly CFS increases and returns, full sample.\n7.3 The Role of Previous Events for the Business Impact of CFS Increases\nLarge jumps in CFS occur more frequently if firms had few or no recent events. This follows because of the concavity in the CFS\nconstruction, by which the first events strongly affect ESG performance, and subsequent events do so gradually less. An event with\ngiven characteristics can thus have a different effect on the CFS, depending on the firm’s history. A sizeable CFS jump can be\ndriven by a single event if the firm had a recent “clean slate,” whereas, for a firm with a large number of recent events, it would\ntake many events to elicit the same CFS reaction.\nTable 7 documents that the frequency of CFS increase dependent on whether the beginning-of-month CFS level is zero or positive.\nA majority of the largest CFS increases (35 or more) occur for firms with an initial CFS of zero, meaning they had no event\nrecorded over the two years prior. On the other hand, the minority of jumps by 10 or more had starting CFS equal to zero.\nSignificant deteriorations in ESG performance are thus statistically more likely to happen to firms with a previous impeccable\nscore, because no events have been recorded about them, at least not recently.\nTable 7 Number of monthly CFS changes, by starting CFS.\nCFS INCREASE THRESHOLD\nSTARTING CFS 40 OR MORE 35 OR MORE 30 OR MORE 20 OR MORE 15 OR MORE 10 OR MORE\nZero 42 835 1,522 1,599 1,599 1,599\nGreater than zero 9 39 210 743 1,271 2,341\nWe conduct abnormal return event studies separately by beginning-of-month CFS level, distinguishing four groups. The results in\nTable 8 and Figure 8 show the most consistent abnormal return patterns for CFS jumps starting at 0, with 1-year abnormal returns\nof −2.57% for increases by 30 or more (occurs 1,522 times), and −7.38% for increases by 38 or more (152 times). But large\nperformance deteriorations also lead to sizeable negative 12-month returns in the other groups, of −4.57%, −14.55%, and −4.49%\nrespectively, with the jump threshold smaller the larger the initial CFS.\nOverall, the results indicate that firms with existing ESG concerns (CFS > 0) are less vulnerable to losses from ESG events. As\nevidenced by fewer number of observations in groups with sizeable negative average returns (even though CFS jump thresholds\nare lower), having had recent previous events shields firms from some of the negative consequences that firms with CFS = 0 suffer\nfrom ESG events. Stock investors seem to be pricing further events in for firms with a known history, which is in line with findings\nby Pineiro et.al. (2022) that firms with many past events are expected to experience more in the future.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 15Table 8 Monthly CFS increases and returns, by starting CFS.\nCFS INCREASE STARTING CFS N AVG 2-M RETURN T-STAT AVG 12-M RETURN T-STAT\n10 or more (-1,0] 1,599 -0.79% -2.52 -2.22% -2.88\n15 or more (-1,0] 1,599 -0.79% -2.52 -2.22% -2.88\n20 or more (-1,0] 1,599 -0.79% -2.52 -2.22% -2.88\n30 or more (-1,0] 1,522 -0.92% -2.85 -2.57% -3.26\n35 or more (-1,0] 835 -0.92% -2.07 -1.53% -1.40\n38 or more (-1,0] 152 -1.44% -1.44 -7.38% -3.00\n40 or more (-1,0] 42 -0.46% -0.25 -6.25% -1.42\n10 or more (0,10] 417 -0.39% -0.70 1.93% 1.40\n15 or more (0,10] 417 -0.39% -0.70 1.93% 1.40\n20 or more (0,10] 414 -0.25% -0.45 2.21% 1.60\n30 or more (0,10] 197 -0.45% -0.52 4.29% 1.99\n35 or more (0,10] 35 -4.77% -2.20 -4.57% -0.86\n38 or more (0,10] 14 -3.11% -0.89 -8.87% -1.04\n10 or more (10,30] 1,421 -0.28% -0.91 0.99% 1.33\n15 or more (10,30] 764 -0.52% -1.21 -0.15% -0.14\n20 or more (10,30] 313 -1.40% -2.07 -0.92% -0.55\n30 or more (10,30] 13 -7.02% -2.29 -14.55% -1.94\n10 or more (30,Inf] 503 -0.49% -1.03 -0.20% -0.17\n15 or more (30,Inf] 90 -0.26% -0.27 -4.49% -1.87\n20 or more (30,Inf] 16 0.86% 0.43 -8.69% -1.76\nNote: Returns are average cumulative abnormal returns.

Note: Returns are average cumulative abnormal returns. We require a minimum of 20 firm-month observations in each group.\nThe largest effects are observed for the smallest size quartile. One possible explanation lies in the fact that smaller firms receive\nless media coverage and have fewer events overall. Controversies of small firms are thus more likely to convey new information\nabout ESG performance, leading to an update of investor perceptions, and corresponding stock losses.\nFigure 8 Monthly CFS increases and returns, by size quartile.\n7.5 Results by Sector\nBy the nature of their operations, firms vary across economic sectors in their risk exposure to suffering different types of ESG\ncontroversies. This is reflected in average CFS values, although some of that might be explained by firm size. Figure 10 shows that\nthere is variation in the rate that firms across sectors experience large CFS increases. Whereas, in Healthcare and Agriculture, the\nCFS increases by 30 or more only in around every 150th firm-month, the frequency in Transportation is every 66th. The frequency\nof jumps by 15 or more varies between every 63rd in Healthcare and more than every 40th in Transportation. Yet despite these\ndifferences, CFS jumps are broadly distributed across all sectors.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 17Figure 9 Frequency of CFS increases, by sector.\nTable 11 and Figure 11 document event study results by sector, where we require a minimum of 20 firm-months observation in\neach case, excluding Agriculture and some jump thresholds in other sectors. There is strong heterogeneity in return patterns. For a\nnumber of sectors, such as Construction, Consumer Products, Energy & Natural Resources, and Finance, firms suffer large negative\nreturns over the 12-month period starting with CFS increases. For jumps of 30 or more, which happen between 79 and 342 times\nin these four sectors, 1-year abnormal returns range from −3.17% to −5.72%. We also find evidence of negative stock returns in\nBusiness Products and Utilities, even though with somewhat less consistency, and to a lesser degree in Hi-Tech and Trade. In all\nother sectors, either short-term losses are reversed over twelve months, or there is little measurable impact of CFS increases\noverall.\nTable 11 Monthly CFS increases and returns, by sector.\nCFS INCREASE SECTOR N AVG 2-M RETURN T-STAT AVG 12-M RETURN T-STAT\n15 or more Business Products 295 0.58% 0.79 2.77% 1.55\n30 or more Business Products 168 -0.17% -0.17 -1.24% -0.51\n35 or more Business Products 92 -0.23% -0.17 -3.88% -1.15\n38 or more Business Products 22 1.42% 0.50 -18.25% -2.60\n15 or more Business Services 190 -1.11% -1.26 2.74% 1.28\n30 or more Business Services 127 -1.68% -1.45 4.48% 1.58\n35 or more Business Services 58 -1.75% -0.94 0.06% 0.01\n15 or more Communication 144 -0.69% -0.75 0.45% 0.20\n30 or more Communication 93 -1.15% -0.97 -1.58% -0.55\n35 or more Communication 47 -3.05% -1.79 2.84% 0.68\n15 or more Construction 128 -2.41% -2.41 -6.93% -2.84\n30 or more Construction 79 -3.56% -2.66 -4.37% -1.33\n35 or more Construction 44 -4.01% -2.26 -4.65% -1.07\n15 or more Consumer Products 293 -0.29% -0.49 -3.64% -2.52\n30 or more Consumer Products 156 -0.67% -0.80 -5.72% -2.78\n35 or more Consumer Products 66 -2.03% -1.51 -6.55% -1.99\n15 or more Energy and Natural Resources 269 -0.96% -0.99 -1.98% -0.84\n30 or more Energy and Natural Resources 150 -0.37% -0.27 -4.46% -1.34\n35 or more Energy and Natural Resources 69 -0.60% -0.30 -5.02% -1.02\n15 or more Finance 517 -1.24% -2.50 -3.70% -3.04\n30 or more Finance 342 -1.16% -2.00 -3.17% -2.23\n35 or more Finance 200 -0.45% -0.60 -0.78% -0.42\n38 or more Finance 42 -2.10% -1.12 -5.16% -1.12\n15 or more Health Care 22 0.47% 0.17 2.28% 0.33\n15 or more HiTech 334 -1.06% -1.42 -0.75% -0.41\n30 or more HiTech 206 -1.59% -1.55 -0.61% -0.24\n35 or more HiTech 113 -2.29% -1.60 -2.41% -0.69\n15 or more Services 118 1.24% 1.14 -0.21% -0.08\n30 or more Services 76 2.02% 1.45 1.29% 0.38\n35 or more Services 35 3.05% 1.53 4.63% 0.95\n15 or more Trade 213 0.21% 0.27 -0.16% -0.09\n30 or more Trade 119 -0.70% -0.63 -1.92% -0.71\n35 or more Trade 54 -1.97% -1.22 -2.28% -0.58\n15 or more Transportation 169 -0.02% -0.02 3.17% 1.40\n30 or more Transportation 99 -0.19% -0.16 3.62% 1.22\n35 or more Transportation 46 0.24% 0.12 6.00% 1.22\n15 or more Utilities 161 -1.32% -1.72 -3.71% -1.98\n30 or more Utilities 97 -0.54% -0.50 -5.23% -1.98\n35 or more Utilities 40 1.76% 1.04 -0.01% 0.00\nNote: Returns are average cumulative abnormal returns. We require a minimum of 20 firm-month observations in each group.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 18These results are intuitive. By their nature, many firms in Energy & Natural Resources must manage the environmental\nconsequences of their operations, the relevance of their activities for climate change, and the physical scale of their enterprises\nand associated dangers for people and communities. Financial institutions are under great scrutiny, both from the regulatory and\nfrom the societal point of view, and there have been various instances of settlements, fines, and lawsuits. Finally, consumer\nproduct firms are under special scrutiny, because of the attention they receive from the general public, which can amplify the\nreputational impact of ESG controversies.\nFigure 10 Monthly CFS increases and returns, by sector.\n8. Conclusion\nRecent years have seen increased attention of company’s ESG-related performance as part of a comprehensive risk assessment by\nlenders, investors, and other stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a quantitative measure of ESG performance based on the\ncontroversies a firm experiences and study the relationship between performance and stock market returns. We show that ESG\nperformance matters strongly for firms’ value, with ESG events leading to large negative abnormal returns. This finding remains\nrobust for firms of all sizes, and holds particularly for firms in the Energy & Natural Resources, Consumer Products, Finance, and\nConstruction sectors. Finally, the largest losses are observed in cases where a firm suffers its first ESG event in two years,\nconsistent with investors viewing these new incidents as potentially indicative of broader issues at the company. In the Appendix,\nwe show that our results are robust to an alternative data source.\nThere are a number of promising routes for further research. In addition to the implications for equity holders, we would like to\nextend the results to incorporate the implications for holders of debt, as well as for the enterprise value of firms as a whole, in\naddition to its market capitalization. Another question is whether our results can inform a profitable trading strategy. Due to their\nforward-looking nature, equity returns are generally expected to fully incorporate all anticipated consequences of ESG events\nrelevant for firm value. However, our results show that losses consistently grow over time. Investors thus seem to be, in the short\nrun, underestimating the total cost of ESG performance to firms, a pattern traders could potentially exploit. An application of the\nresults in this paper would be to derive the implications of ESG risk for equity price volatility. Our stock loss estimates can serve as\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 19a key input for such an estimation. Finally, these results could be suggestive for how a lender may want to incorporate ESG\nconsiderations into traditional credit risk assessment.\nAppendix: Results using RepRisk Data\nWe also carry out tests on the business impact of ESG events using data from RepRisk, a Zürich-based ESG data science firm. The\ncore of RepRisk’s data are ESG incidents, gathered by screening more than 100,000 media and stakeholder sources in 23\nlanguages daily, using artificial intelligence combined with expert judgement. Incidents are defined as criticisms, adverse business\nconduct issues, controversies, scandals, etc. that can have a reputational, compliance, or financial impact on a company, and that\ninvolve a violation of at least one of 28 Issues that RepRisk tracks.7 These Issues are based on international standards related to\nESG issues and business conduct.8 In addition to an incident’s date, relevant Issues, and related countries, RepRisk assigns scores\nregarding Severity, Reach, and Novelty that characterize an incident.\nRepRisk produces a score, the RepRisk Index (RRI), which summarizes all incidents that a firm has experienced during the past two\nyears into a quantitative measure of reputational risk exposure to ESG issues. The RRI score varies between 0 (lowest risk) to 100,\nand the assessment is updated daily. The effect of an individual incident on the RRI depends on its severity, reach, and novelty, as\nwell as on the previous incidents a firm has experienced. The RRI generally moves up on days when incidents happen, and it falls\non days when no incident occurs. In our empirical tests, we use monthly changes in the RRI as measure of ESG performance and\nrelate them to abnormal stock returns. We use the event study methodology in Section 4.\nThe sample of firms studied in this section is based on the universe of publicly listed firms that have ever been rated by Moody’s\nInvestors Service. In addition, we require firms to have at least one incident recorded in RepRisk’s database. This is the case for\nroughly 75% of the rated universe, or 3,268 firms. Our final dataset contains all firm-month observations with available 12-month\nabnormal return starting in the period, 209,851 returns for 2,987 firms spanning the period January 2010–June 2019.\nWe find that monthly changes in the RepRisk Index show a strong relationship between RRI increases and abnormal stock returns\nestimated using a market model, with larger RRI increases associated with more negative returns. Moreover, the losses we find are\npersistent over (at least) a 12-month period, and, in fact, become larger over time. Using a global dataset, we show negative value\nimpacts of ESG incidents to be a broad-based phenomenon, occurring across firms of all sizes and in most sectors.\nThe magnitude of effects we find ranges from meaningful, for events that happen rather frequently, to dramatic, for the most\nsevere, rarer events. Figure 12 shows results for the full sample. We estimate that jumps in RRI by 30 or more points over one\nmonth on average lead to abnormal returns of −1.4% in the month of the jump, and −4.1% cumulatively over one year. RRI jumps\nof this size happen over 1,000 times in our sample of around 3,000 firms over 10 years, meaning roughly one in every thirty firms\nexperiences such a jump in any given year. For jumps of 10 or more, the smallest threshold where we find a persistent and\nsignificant effect, average abnormal returns are −0.5% (one month) and −0.9% (one year). Overall, the ESG events we identify are\nshown to have lasting consequences, which tend to unfold over time, and we confirm these effects occur across firm of all size\ncategories.\n7 RepRisk AG, “RepRisk Methodology Overview,” Privileged, April 2021, reprisk.com.\n8 These standards include: The World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines; The International Finance Corporation Performance Standard;\nthe Equator Principles; The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; and The International Labour Organization Conventions. In addition, the Ten\nPrinciples of the UN Global Compact, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Materiality Map; and the United Nations Sustainable Development\nGoals can be mapped to RepRisk’s research scope and RepRisk's 28 Issues.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 20Figure 11 Monthly RRI increases and returns, full sample.\nJumps starting at an RRI level of zero are usually caused by a small number of incidents, whereas more incidents are needed to\ncause a jump from higher starting RRI levels. We test how these two types of jumps differ regarding their impact on firm value,\nand, in both cases, find significant effects (see Figure 13). They are larger starting from RRI > 0, meaning the firm already had\nincidents during the two years prior. However, because of the RRI’s concavity in the number of incidents, large index jumps occur\nmuch more frequently to firms at low RRI levels. Thus, firms with a previously clean ESG slate are statistically more at risk of\nsuffering reputational damage that leads to a negative value shock, but when reputation slips for firms with a history of incidents\nthe value effect is generally larger.\nFigure 12 Monthly RRI increases and returns, by starting RRI.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 21We find that the effects of ESG events differ by sector. In most sectors, a short-term effect is visible, but its size and persistence\nover time vary. The biggest drops in market capitalization following ESG incidents happen for firms in the Energy & Natural\nResources and Trade sectors. A number of other sectors, including Business Products and Finance also display large and lasting\neffects. In Agriculture and Health Care, short-term negative stock price effects are mostly recovered over a 12-month horizon. In\nsome sectors, no negative effects of ESG events are detectable, most notably in Construction. In order to explain our findings, we\nlook for patterns in the specific RepRisk ESG Issues that occur for firms in a given sector, but find no helpful relationships. Our\nresults thus suggest that firms in certain sectors are more vulnerable to negative consequences of ESG incidents given the nature\nof their operations.\nFigure 13 Monthly RRI increases and returns, by sector.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE BUSINESS IMPACT OF ESG PERFORMANCE 22References\nCampbell, John Y., Andrew W.
