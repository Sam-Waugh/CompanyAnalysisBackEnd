Introduction\nThe increased digitization of business and its reliance on IT infrastructure has exposed virtually every aspect of the economy to\ncyber risk. The pervasive and growing nature of cyber threats has made cybersecurity risk management a matter of paramount\nconcern for corporate boards, regulators, investors, market participants, and consumers alike. In a recent survey of financial\ninstitutions, 87% of respondents reported that managing cybersecurity risk will be an extremely or very high priority over the next\ntwo years, the highest percentage of 16 priorities surveyed.1\nAs the frequency and severity of cyber-attacks continues to rise, the potential negative consequences on a company's financial\nperformance and market value have become increasingly important considerations. However, due to the complex and\nmultifaceted nature of cyber risk, it is difficult to assess its true financial impact. The lack of public disclosure of cybersecurity\nevents and their resulting financial impact is a pervasive market issue. Companies often refrain from sharing information about\ncybersecurity incidents to protect their reputation and customer base, limiting accurate, comprehensive identification of cyber\nevents.2\nThe rising number of cyber incidents has raised the attention of organizations and stakeholders alike. Figure 1 provides a\ncompelling depiction of the increase of publicly disclosed incidents from 2015 to 2023, shedding light on the prevailing cyber risk\nlandscape and its evolving implications. In just the past 5 years alone the number of publicly reported cyber incidents has doubled.\nThe continuous upward trend in cyber incidents is emphasized by a notable peak in 2020, largely attributed to the disruptive\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFigure 1: Rising cyber-attack trend – reported events have doubled in the past 5 years\nNote: Publicly disclosed cyber events dataset contains data from Jan 2015 to March 2023. Number of events in 2023 is projected based on the average monthly observation\non the first quarter of the year and demoted in a lighter shade of blue.\nThe unique circumstances surrounding the pandemic contributed to the heightened cyber risk landscape. As organizations\ntransitioned to remote work models, their average digital attack surface expanded significantly. The coexistence of corporate\nendpoints with a vast number of vulnerable consumer and Internet of Things devices within Work From Home-Remote networks\nintroduced new and distinct cybersecurity risks compared to traditional in-office corporate networks.3 As businesses gained a\ndeeper understanding of these cyber threats, there was a noticeable decline in the frequency of such incidents after 2020.\nIn this article we examine the factors driving the probability and financial impact of cyber events. We investigate the relation\nbetween an organization’s cyber security performance and the likelihood of cyber incidents occurring. Additionally, in observing\nthe abnormal equity returns up to 12 months after a cyber event occurred, we assess the impact of these incidents on a firm's\nmarket value and credit risk factors.\n1 “Global Risk Management Survey, 12th Edition,” Deloitte.\n2 On July 26, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to adopt new cybersecurity requirements for publicly traded companies,\ncreating new obligations for reporting “material” cybersecurity incidents and requiring more detailed disclosure of cybersecurity risk management, expertise,\nand governance. Companies will be required to disclose risks in their annual reports beginning on December 15, 2023.\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Press release 2023-139, accessed August 30, 2023. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-139]\n3 \"Rush to Work from Home Exposes Alarming Security Issues,\" Bitsight, accessed June 14, 2023 [https://www.Bitsight.com/press-releases/rush-to-work-from-\nhome-exposes-alarming-security-issues]\n3\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKOur analysis encompasses the evaluation of monthly data from 2,571 public companies from 2015 to 2023. The results reveal a\nclear correlation between a decline in cyber security performance, as measured by the Bitsight cybersecurity rating (ranging from\n250 to 900, with lower ratings indicating poorer performance), and a notable rise in the frequency of reported incidents. Further\nelaboration on this relationship can be found in section 3.\nTo illustrate this connection, we divided our sample into five percentiles based on the Bitsight cybersecurity rating. Figure 2 shows\nthe percentage of reported events. The graph shows that Bitsight cybersecurity ratings strictly rank order the risk of cyber events,\nand demonstrates that companies in the quintile with the lowest ratings experience an incidence rate that is 2.6 times higher than\nthat of the quintile with the highest ratings.\nFigure 2: Poor cyber practices lead to 2.6x more Incidents\nPercentage of reported incidents by cybersecurity rating bracket. Bitsight rates the cybersecurity performance of companies on a scale of 250 to 900, with the current\nachievable range being 300-820. Source: Bitsight and Moody’s Analytics.\nIn our analysis, we demonstrate there are substantial, statistically significant, and persistent negative impacts of cyber incidents on\nfirm value. Our findings show a robust association between cyber-attacks and abnormal equity returns, estimated through a\nmarket model. Specifically, our study reveals that moderate impact cyber events result in average abnormal equity returns ranging\nfrom -0.3% to -5.3% over a 12-month period (See section 2.2 for event study methodology description). These outcomes\nunderscore the potentially significant financial consequences associated with cyber events and emphasize the urgency of\nimplementing effective strategies for cyber risk management within companies.\nAdditionally, we examine variations of attacks across industry sectors, with finance, healthcare, and technology industries standing\nout as especially susceptible to attacks. Figure 3 offers an overview of reported events in the extensive dataset of publicly disclosed\nincidents.\nFigure 3: Healthcare, Finance and Technology sectors under siege\nNumber of publicly disclosed cyber events by industry. Source: Bitsight\nThere are several potential reasons why companies in Healthcare, Technology, and Finance are more likely to be targeted by\nhackers. The primary factor is the significant value of data held by these sectors. They deal with vast amounts of sensitive\n4\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKinformation, including financial records, personal health data, and intellectual property, which can be exploited for financial gain or\nother malicious purposes.\nThe Finance sector, in particular, attracts attacks like banking fraud, credit card theft, and ransomware. Healthcare is often a prime\ntarget due to its vast amount of sensitive personal data, including medical records, insurance details, and social security numbers,\nwhich hold significant value on the black market for identity theft, insurance fraud, and other illicit activities. The Technology\nsector, reliant on interconnected systems and networks, is highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to evolving technological\nadvancements that introduce new exploitable vulnerabilities. Additionally, the sector's valuable intellectual property and trade\nsecrets attract competitors and nation-states seeking advantages. The interconnectedness of technology infrastructure magnifies\nthe potential impact of cyber-attacks, as compromising one system can have far-reaching consequences across multiple sectors.\nOur research illuminates a distinct and direct correlation between a company's size and its vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This\nconnection finds support through a positive and statistically significant coefficient embedded within the probabilistic model\noutlined in Section 4.1. Larger companies encounter heightened risks due to their relatively larger asset pools, a substantial\ncustomer base, and an extensive digital footprint. While smaller companies are not impervious to such threats, the magnitude and\nresources of larger organizations expose them to greater vulnerabilities, underscoring the imperative for robust cybersecurity\nmeasures to effectively mitigate these risks.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the research methodology employed in this study, while\nSection 3 describes the data utilized. In Section 4, we present our empirical results that associate cyber security risk management\npractices and the probability of a cyber-related attack. In Section 5, we examine the impact of cyber events on firm value and\ncredit risk. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper by summarizing the main findings.\n5\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISK2. Methodology\nThe expected losses of a cyber event are defined as the product of the event's probability and the losses incurred once a cyber\nevent has taken place:\nFor the probability of a cyber inc𝐸𝐸id𝐸𝐸e𝐸𝐸n𝐸𝐸t𝐸𝐸, 𝐸𝐸w𝐸𝐸e𝐸𝐸 u 𝐿𝐿s𝐿𝐿e 𝐿𝐿a𝐿𝐿 lo=gi𝑃𝑃st𝑃𝑃ic𝐿𝐿 m𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃o𝑃𝑃d𝑃𝑃e𝑃𝑃l𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸a𝑃𝑃p p𝐿𝐿r𝑜𝑜o a𝐸𝐸c𝐸𝐸h.𝐸𝐸 T𝐸𝐸h𝐸𝐸is∗ s𝐿𝐿ta𝐿𝐿t𝐿𝐿is𝐿𝐿t i𝐺𝐺ca𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸l m𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸o d𝐸𝐸e𝐸𝐸li𝐸𝐸n𝐸𝐸g𝐸𝐸 t echnique allows us to assess\nthe likelihood of a cyber event occurring conditional on a set of firm characteristics. Secondly, for the losses associated with an\nobserved cyber incident, we adopt an event-based methodology. This approach examines the deviation from expected equity\nreturns that arises after a cyber incident occurs. In this section, we outline these methodologies in detail, providing insights into\nour approach for determining the expected losses.\n2.1 Probability of a cyber event\nIn order to predict the probability of a cyber event and gain insights into the impact of the cybersecurity rating, a logit model is\nemployed. This statistical method is well-suited for estimating binary outcomes pertaining to cyber events. By conducting an\nanalysis of historical data and identifying pertinent factors, such as system vulnerabilities, user behaviors, and network\nconfigurations, the logit model is able to transform these variables into probabilities ranging from 0 to 1. This valuable\ninformation equips organizations with the ability to evaluate and manage their cybersecurity risks more effectively, facilitating\nthe proactive allocation of resources and the mitigation of potential threats. Mathematically, the logit model can be represented\nas:\n1\n𝑃𝑃(𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸)= −(𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝑋𝑋)\nThe set of drivers, denoted by includes firmographic information s1uc+h 𝐸𝐸as industry, size, and cybersecurity performance. In\nsection 3, we provide a detailed description of the data used and how it captures an organization's capacity to safeguard against\ncyber threats. The coefficients 𝑋𝑋β ,capture the respective effects of these drivers on the probability of a cyber event, with the\nlogistic function enabling the transformation of the linear combination into the desired probability estimate.\n−(𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑋𝑋)\n𝐸𝐸\n2.2 Event study methodology and financial impact of a cyber event\nTo evaluate the financial consequences of a cyber incident, we employ an event study approach. This methodology, widely\nutilized in financial econometrics (Campbell, Lo, MacKinlay, 1997), allows us to gauge the stock price's reaction to particular\nevents, including corporate earnings releases, mergers and acquisitions, regulatory alterations, and other noteworthy\ndevelopments. Our approach draws inspiration from the research conducted by Dwyer et al. (2022), where they assessed the\nrepercussions of ESG controversies. We adopt a similar strategy to investigate the effect of cyber incidents.\nEvent studies rely on a robust theoretical framework that generates anticipated equity returns and serves as the foundation for\ncomparing observed value fluctuations. Two pivotal assumptions in our approach encompass market efficiency and the forward-\nlooking nature of market agents. The former assumes that stock prices swiftly react and accurately reflect all available\ninformation, while the latter posits that prices embody the expectations of market participants regarding future profits. These\nassumptions not only enable us to model expected returns but also provide us with a counterfactual scenario, illustrating what\nwould happen if no additional information, such as a cyber event or an ESG controversy, were integrated into the market.\nExpected equity returns are typically estimated using a market model calibrated on historical data, and are compared to observed\nreturns over a specific time period. We run tests to evaluate whether the disparity between expected and observed returns is\nstatistically significant. The difference between these two returns, expected and observed, is denoted as abnormal returns and is a\nkey metric in our analysis. In Section 2.2.1 we provide further insight on the calculation of those elements of the model.\n2.2.1 Expected, observed and abnormal equity returns\nIn this study, we utilize a factor model to determine a firm's expected equity return based on its exposure to systematic risk\nfactors (MacKinlay, 1997). Specifically, we focus on a single risk factor market model as shown in equation (1).\n(1)\n𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖.\n6\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKWhere represents the sensitivity of firm at time to a Market factor represented by 4 over a rolling window .

We\ncalculate a firm’s expected equity value months after an observed cyber event in period t using the expected return derived\nfrom equation (1) and the firm’s market value at the moment of the event, as shown in equation (4) below.\nℎ\n(4)\nWhile not directly observable, we can estimate𝑆𝑆 𝑖𝑖 t+ hℎ e =ma𝐸𝐸r𝐸𝐸ke𝐸𝐸t �v𝑅𝑅a� l𝑖𝑖 u,𝑖𝑖 e+ ℎ o�f t∙h e𝑆𝑆 𝑖𝑖 assets of a firm's using the stockprice . We achieve this\nby employing the estimation method proposed in Moody's Analytics' EDFTM structural credit risk model, as outlined by Nazeran\nand Dwyer (2015).

The figure consists of two graphs: one\ndepicting the market cap on the left side and the other displaying the probability of default on the right side. The historical values\nleading up to the incident are depicted in gray, while the expected and observed values after the event are shown in green and\nblue, respectively. Following the incident, the observed market value significantly deviated from the expected value, which was\ninitially projected to continue its upward trend. The substantial decline in market value following the cyber event consequently\nincreased the credit risk for the company.\nFigure 4: Realized and expected market value and probability of default after a severe cyber-event\n3. Data\nWe combine two key sources of information: cyber risk and public company financial and credit risk data. Cybersecurity data\nprovides valuable insights into organizations' security practices and is provided by Bitsight. Credit risk information is obtained\nfrom Moody’s Analytics’ CreditEdgeTM data, and contains market and financial information for public companies encompassing\ndebt, market capitalization, and forward-looking modeled probabilities of default for over 38,000 firms globally and over 11,000\ndefault events over the past 50 years.7 Our analysis covers monthly information from 2015 to 2023, allowing us to gain a\ncomprehensive understanding of trends and developments during this timeframe.\n3.1 Publicly disclosed cyber events and the Bitsight cybersecurity rating\nWe utilize publicly disclosed cyber events and security ratings from Bitsight to assess the cybersecurity status of companies.\nBitsight collects information on data breaches and other security incidents from a large number of verifiable sources, including\nreputable news organizations and regulatory reporting (obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests or local equivalents).\nThe publicly disclosed data encompasses a range of cyber-related incidents such as data breaches, crimeware, espionage,\nintrusion, ransomware, phishing attacks, and other security-related events. This dataset comprises over 45,000 records,\ncorresponding to 28,000 events, with a single event potentially affecting multiple companies either directly or indirectly.\nBitsight categorizes cybersecurity events into four severity levels: Informational, Minor, Moderate, and Severe. The classification\ndepends on the observed event and the number of affected users. Severity is determined by factors such as the number of\nrecords of personal information exposed, the type of event, and the company's size. This classification accounts for the higher risk\nbaseline associated with larger companies.\nAdditionally, we use Bitsight cybersecurity ratings data. Bitsight’s cybersecurity ratings are generated through the analysis of\nexternally observable data, leveraging Bitsight's proprietary techniques to identify the scope of a company's entire digital\n7 The CreditEdge data set is a subset of the EDF-X solution, which contains information on over 450 million firms globally, including firm financials and\nprescored probabilities of default.\n8\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKfootprint. This data-driven approach requires no cooperation from the rated company. The rating is representative of the\ncybersecurity performance of an entire company, including its subsidiaries, business units, and geographic locations. The original\ndataset contains daily observations for more than 38,000 companies, from Jan 2025 to March 2023.8 We conduct our analysis at\nthe monthly level and limit it to public companies.\n3.2 Public company risk and expected returns\nWe conducted an empirical analysis using publicly listed companies to develop a methodology for evaluating the impact of\ncyber-related incidents on company value and credit risk. Our research focused on companies that reported cyber events from\nJanuary 2015 to March 2023. To gather relevant data, we accessed Moody's Analytics public company database to obtain\nmonthly equity returns, which were cross-referenced with geographical matches on Kenneth French's website. Additionally, we\nused Moody's Analytics CreditEdgeTM data for the same period. The data includes publicly traded firms information such as\nprobability of default, market cap, calculated asset volatility and drift, and balance sheet and income statement line items. All\nreturns considered in this study were firm-level monthly log returns.\nTo create a comprehensive dataset, we combined Bitsight's cybersecurity incident records with Moody's Analytics' equity returns\ndata, resulting in 3,354 observations corresponding to 3,824 events across 1,542 distinct public firms. Our analysis was based on\nmonthly data, with the awareness that certain firms experienced multiple attacks within the same month. To account for this, we\nconsidered the number of attacks per month but focused exclusively on the most severe incident recorded.\n3.3 Descriptive Statistics\nIn our event studies, we examine both the short-term impact of cyber events by analyzing the expected and observed equity\nreturn during the month of the event, as well as the longer-term effect by assessing the return over a 12-month period starting at\nthe event date. Table 1 presents the comprehensive return distributions for these time horizons.\nTable1: Statistics on average monthly cumulative abnormal returns\nPERCENTILE\nMonth MINIMUM MAXIMUM MEAN\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\n1 -0.10 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0.00 0.01 0.03 0.06 0.10 -0.61 0.68 0.00\n2 -0.15 -0.09 -0.06 -0.03 0.00 0.02 0.05 0.08 0.13 -0.92 1.00 -0.01\n3 -0.19 -0.12 -0.07 -0.04 0.00 0.03 0.06 0.10 0.17 -1.19 1.02 -0.01\n4 -0.23 -0.14 -0.08 -0.04 0.00 0.03 0.07 0.12 0.19 -1.90 1.28 -0.01\n5 -0.26 -0.16 -0.10 -0.05 -0.01 0.03 0.08 0.13 0.22 -2.19 1.38 -0.02\n6 -0.28 -0.17 -0.10 -0.05 -0.01 0.03 0.08 0.13 0.25 -2.65 1.61 -0.02\n7 -0.31 -0.19 -0.12 -0.06 -0.01 0.03 0.08 0.15 0.27 -2.99 1.66 -0.02\n8 -0.33 -0.21 -0.13 -0.07 -0.02 0.03 0.08 0.16 0.28 -3.04 2.20 -0.02\n9 -0.36 -0.22 -0.14 -0.07 -0.01 0.03 0.09 0.18 0.31 -3.24 2.13 -0.03\n10 -0.38 -0.23 -0.14 -0.07 -0.02 0.04 0.10 0.19 0.33 -3.24 2.39 -0.02\n11 -0.41 -0.26 -0.15 -0.08 -0.02 0.04 0.11 0.19 0.34 -3.24 2.17 -0.03\n12 -0.42 -0.27 -0.16 -0.09 -0.02 0.04 0.11 0.20 0.36 -3.24 2.16 -0.03\nIn our data analysis, we made some noteworthy observations regarding cyber events reported by companies. While most firms\ntypically disclose only one cyber event per month, some companies report four or more events within the same month.\nFurthermore, our analysis revealed that certain companies experienced an alarmingly high number of attacks, exceeding 40\nincidents between January 2015 and March 2023. This highlights the fact that these companies are not only subject to frequent\nattacks but are also prime targets for cyber events.\nTo provide a clearer picture of these patterns, we present our findings in two tables. Table 2 presents the distribution of the\nnumber of attacks per company per month, shedding light on the frequency at which attacks occur for each company.\nMeanwhile, Table 3 offers a broader perspective by showcasing the distribution of attacks in general, providing valuable insights\ninto their overall occurrence and impact.\nTable 2: Distribution of number of events by firm and month\n8 For more detailed information on Bitsight’s rating methodology, including data collection methods and underlying risk vectors, please refer to Bitsight\n(2023).\n9\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKNumber of events per firm and month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Total\nNumber of companies 3,021 239 67 18 5 2 1 1 3,354\nTable 3: Distribution of number of events by firm reported between Jan 2015 and March 2023\nNumber of Total events by company 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 - 40 41 - 104 Total\nNumber of companies 1,014 239 100 62 33 21 15 8 4 35 11 1,542\n10\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISK4. Results\nIn this section, we present the empirical findings of our analysis. Our study demonstrates that the probability of a cyber incident is\ninfluenced by various factors, including the company's implementation of robust cyber practices as measured by the Bitsight\ncybersecurity rating, as well as the industry and size of the firm. Specifically, larger companies face heightened targeting by\nmalicious actors and are more vulnerable to potential errors made by employees, given their larger workforce. These factors can\nlead to the proliferation of open ports, spam, or phishing activities, consequently expanding the overall cyber-attack surface.\nFurthermore, our analysis reveals statistically significant and negative average abnormal equity returns over a 12-month period\nfollowing a cyber incident. These deviations from expected values indicate the adverse impact of cyber events on stock returns.\nAdditionally, our investigation highlights that the diminished equity values resulting from cyber incidents can contribute to the\nsubsequent deterioration of credit risk.\n4.1 Probability of a cyber incident: companies with poorer cybersecurity performance are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks\nFollowing the framework presented in Section 2.1, our empirical findings yielded significant insights into the probability of cyber\nevents. Notably, the cybersecurity vector emerged as a crucial factor, demonstrating a negative and statistically significant\ncoefficient.\nMoreover, our investigation took into account industry variations, which revealed a significant impact on the likelihood of cyber\nevents. Certain industries exhibiting a higher frequency of events or were more inclined to publicly disclose them. Table 4, detailed\non the Appendix presents key elements of the model. Figure 6 visually presents the expected and observed probabilities of cyber\nevents across different months, offering valuable insights into the temporal patterns and fluctuations of these events throughout\nthe year.\nFigure 6 illustrates the model's fit, as presented in Table 2, across various dimensions such as time, size, and cyber performance.\nThe observed data is represented by the light blue line, while the darker blue line represents the fitted data. Overall, the model\nexhibits a good fit, although a few spikes in the data can be observed due to limited information availability. Figure 7, in the\nappendix, shows an accuracy of 80.2% which indicates the strong performance of the model described in table 5. The accuracy is\nmeasures by the area under the curve (AUC), which measures how well a classification model can distinguish between two\ncategories (cyber event or non cyber event)\nFigure 6: Observed and fitted probability by driver\nNote: The spike in December 2020 represents an increase in the number of reported events that may have occurred prior to that. We account for such events.\nFigure 8 illustrates the conditional probability of an incident based on the cyber score quantile. The probability increases in the\nlowest performance quantile (dark green), contrasting with the highest performance quantile (lime green). This finding suggests\nthat as organizations improve their cybersecurity performance, the likelihood of experiencing an attack decreases.\nFurthermore, our analysis revealed that larger companies are more susceptible to breaches. Figure 9 illustrates the probability of\nincidents based on company size, measured in dollar sales. Companies with sales exceeding 10 million dollars are more vulnerable\n11\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKcompared to those in the lowest sales bracket. This observation not only indicates that cyber criminals tend to target larger\norganizations but also emphasizes the added complexity associated with firm size and scale, and more complex IT systems in\nbigger companies.\nFigure 8: Probability of a cyber incident by security score quantile\nFigure 9: Probability of a cyber incident by size quantile\nIn Figure 10, in the appendix, we present the percentage of cyber incidents categorized by grade for each risk vector. The grades,\nranging from A to F, represent percentiles within Bitsight's entire universe of rated firms, rather than the specific public company\ndata sample we used in our study. Across several dimensions, we observe a consistent trend: stronger performance in a given\ndimension corresponds to a lower likelihood of reporting an incident. This pattern holds true for vectors such as botnet infections,\ndesktop software, insecure systems, potentially exploited systems, and web application headers.\nHowever, the relationship is not consistently monotonic for other vectors, particularly patching cadence. In contrast, we observe\nan apparently inverse trend for DKIM records and a relatively flat pattern for TLS SSL certificates and configuration. These findings\nhighlight the nuanced relationships between performance grades and incident rates across different risk vectors, underscoring the\nneed for a comprehensive understanding of each dimension's impact on cyber incident probabilities.\n12\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISK4.2 Cyber incidents may result in negative abnormal equity returns months after the event\nAfter evaluating the likelihood of an occurrence, our primary goal is to estimate its financial repercussions. Throughout the\nresearch described in this document we have observed that, on average, a cyber incident leads to a detrimental outcome that may\nendure for up to one year. Moreover, the severity of the incident exacerbates its impact. The relationship between these factors is\ndepicted in Figure 11, which illustrates that the cumulative abnormal equity returns consistently sustain an influence well beyond\nthe 12-month threshold following the cyber event. To determine the statistical significance of the average cumulative abnormal\nreturns, we conduct a t-test as follows:\n𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝑅𝑅\n𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑙𝑙.𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶 = ,\nTable 4 presents the impact of cybersecurity incidents on returns. 𝑆𝑆 T𝐸𝐸h𝐴𝐴 e𝐴𝐴 d𝑙𝑙 e.𝐶𝐶 g𝐴𝐴 r𝐶𝐶 ee of severity in a cyber event is evaluated through a\npoint scale established by Bitsight. Incidents accrue points based on several key factors, including the nature of the incident, the\nvolume of data impacted, and the sensitivity of the compromised information9. During the 1-month period following the incident,\nthe informational event type shows a mean cumulative abnormal return of -0.54%, the minor incident type has a slightly worse\nmean return of -0.674%, and the moderate to severe cases have a mean return of -0.28%. Moving to the 12-month mark, all\nevent types exhibit significant negative returns. The informational event type has a mean return of -3.796%, while the minor event\ntype experiences a larger decline with a mean return of -5.041%. As anticipated, the moderate to severe events demonstrate the\nmost substantial decrease, with a mean cumulative return of -5.352%. In all cases, the high t-statistic suggests statistical\nsignificance with a confidence level of 1%.\nIt is important to note that although more severe events may not have an immediate negative impact, they tend to have the most\nsignificant detrimental effects in the long run. Overall, these findings indicate that the severity of the incident and the time\nelapsed since it occurred significantly influence the cumulative abnormal returns. Larger declines are observed for longer periods\nand more severe events. The t-values indicate the statistical significance of the mean returns.\nFigure 11: Average cumulative abnormal returns up to 12 months after incident by severity classification\n9 Informational events predominantly encompass internal company incidents, such as DNS disruptions, where no personal information loss is recorded. Minor\nincidents, on the other hand, involve the loss of personal information for up to 100 individuals and are often linked to human errors or employee privilege\nmisuse. In contrast, more severe events typically encompass instances of crimeware, espionage, and ransomware, involving the compromise of substantial\namounts of data with malicious intent\n13\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKTable 4: Average cumulative abnormal return by severity and months after cyber incident.\nEvent type N mean t\n1 - month after incident\nInformational 1395 -0.54 % -5.12089\nMinor 680 -0.674% -3.11278\nModerate to severe 1308 -0.28 % -2.48496\n2 - month after incident\nInformational 1377 -0.678 % -4.48888\nMinor 669 -2.084 % -6.7019\nModerate to severe 1292 -0.999 % -6.20012\n12- months after incident\nInformational 1247 -3.796 % -9.28625\nMinor 610 -5.041 % -6.0334\nModerate to severe 1163 -5.352 % -12.2115\nMoreover, our analysis reveals that the impact of incidents varies significantly across different industries. Notably, while the\nFinance, Healthcare, and Technology sectors are more frequently targeted by attacks, the average losses incurred in these\nindustries are comparatively lower than those experienced by other sectors in our sample, such as Real Estate, Tourism, and Media\nand Entertainment. In other words, despite facing a higher frequency of attacks, the Financial, Healthcare, and Technology\nindustries appear to have more effective security measures or are better equipped to mitigate the financial consequences of\nincidents. On the other hand, industries like Real Estate, Tourism, and Media and Entertainment seem to be more vulnerable,\nexperiencing higher average losses even with a lower frequency of attacks. This insight underscores the importance of industry-\nspecific risk management strategies and highlights the need for tailored security measures to address the unique challenges faced\nby different sectors. In the Appendix we also present results on the average number of cyber events across different industries as a\nfunction of the different attack vectors considered and the grades awarded by Bitsight.\n14\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKFigure 12: Average 1-month to 12-months cumulative abnormal returns\n4.3 Impact on credit risk: loss on stock value potentially leads to credit risk deterioration\nUsing the methodology described in Section 2.2.2, we can estimate how cyber events can be linked to abnormal returns in equity\nprice. Focusing on the cases where we observe a negative abnormal return, that is, where the observed return is lower than\nexpected, we can leverage Moody’s EDF methodology to estimate the implied deterioration in credit risk. The intuition behind this\napproach is that a deterioration in stock price return (with respect to the expected return) implies a deterioration in the (market-\nimplied) asset value return. This consequently implies that, under the lower observed return, the asset value of the firm comes\ncloser to the default barrier than would have been expected. From this, we can estimate the impact of the abnormal return on the\ncredit risk of the firm.\nIt is important to mention that it is difficult to isolate the impact of cyber events on changes in stock returns. In fact, it is often the\ncase that observed returns are higher than expected, which suggests that other market forces may mask the negative impact of\ncyber events. Nevertheless, we are confident that negative abnormal returns are driven by these cyber events, since, as observed in\nSection Section 4.2, \"moderate\" and \"severe\" cyber events result in lower abnormal returns than when the cyber events are\ncategorized as \"informational\" by BitSight.. On average, market losses contribute to a 0.18% increase in the probability of default\nafter one month following the event, and a 0.24% increase after 12 months. Figure 13 illustrates the changes in the probability of\ndefault relative to the expected values at 1 and 12 months subsequent to a cyber event. To aid comprehension, the distribution is\nrestricted to cases where the observed probability of default exceeds the expected value, and the results are presented in\nlogarithmic differences. Instances where a favorable effect is observed can be attributed to concurrent market events exerting\nopposing influences.\nFurthermore, it is noteworthy that the distribution of the 12-month increase in probability of default (PD) demonstrates a more\npronounced rightward shift (depicted in light blue) compared to the distribution corresponding to the 1-month increase (depicted\nin darker blue). This observation highlights that changes in asset value can have enduring implications for credit risk up to one year\nafter the occurrence of a cyber event.\nWe also extend our analysis to the industry level, focusing on selected industries. Consistent with our findings in Figure 12, we note\nthat the impact on credit risk not only varies over time but also across industries. Interestingly, the results indicate that industries\n15\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISKheavily targeted, such as Finance, Healthcare, and Technology, exhibit a distribution that is more skewed towards zero, suggesting\nthe presence of resilience against cyber threats.\nFigure 13: Distribution of changes in probability of default with respect to expected values 1 and 12 months after a cyber-event\nFigure 14: Distribution of changes in probability of default with respect to expected values 1 and 12 months after a cyber-event by\nindustry.\n16\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISK5. Conclusion\nOur study provides empirical evidence regarding the persistent nature of cybersecurity incidents and their financial implications.\nGiven the sensitive and invaluable nature of the data they handle, organizations operating within these sectors must prioritize\nrobust security measures and allocate ample resources to safeguard their assets effectively. We found that cybersecurity practices,\nas proxied by the Bitsight cybersecurity rating, are strongly correlated with the likelihood of a cyber incident. The statistically\nsignificant and negative coefficient associated with Bitsight’s cybersecurity rating reinforces the imperative of ongoing evaluation\nand enhancement of cybersecurity measures to reduce the likelihood of adverse events.\nMoreover, our study elucidates the significant negative impacts of cyber incidents on financial performance, as evidenced by the\nenduring negative equity returns experienced over a 12-month period following severe events. This finding points out the\npotentially persistent financial implications of cybersecurity breaches and emphasizes the urgency of swift and efficacious incident\nresponse strategies to mitigate potential damage to a company's market value.\nCyber events can disrupt a company's equity returns trajectory and exert a detrimental impact on its market asset value, thus\npotentially affecting its credit risk. These findings underscore the interconnected nature between cybersecurity and financial\nsoundness, emphasizing the necessity for organizations to incorporate cyber risk management as an integral component of their\nbroader risk management strategies.\nNotably, our findings also unveil pronounced disparities in the impact of cyber incidents across different industries. While some\nindustries such as Finance, Healthcare, and Technology sectors experience a higher frequency of attacks, they demonstrate a\ncomparatively superior ability to mitigate the financial consequences of such incidents, resulting in lower average losses. This\nsuggests that these industries have successfully implemented effective risk management practices and made substantial\ninvestments in cybersecurity measures to shield their assets and alleviate financial risks.\nTaken all together, the results of our empirical analysis further emphasize the importance of cybersecurity as key component of an\nintegrated risk assessment framework, alongside credit risk, operational risk, compliance, supply chain, and more. Developing a\nrisk-aware culture, and supplying risk managers with the tools and data required to assess, monitor, communicate, and respond is\nneeded. Our findings here indicate that those goals are both urgent and achievable.\n17\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS THE IMPACT OF CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF CYBER EVENTS AND ITS EFFECT ON\nFINANCIAL RISK6.

Appendix\nDetails of the logistic regression model used to predict the probability of a cyber event are presented below. Table 5 shows that\nBitsight's cybersecurity rating, together with log-sales (used as a proxy for firm size), are good predictors of whether a company will\nlikely experience a cyber event. In particular, companies with a better cyber rating score tend to experience fewer events, whereas\nthe larger the company, the more events take place.\nTable 5: Probability of cyber event model\nVariable\nEstimate Std.

However, it should be noted that this is a largely imbalanced data set, as\nthe history of publicly disclosed cyber events is relatively small.
