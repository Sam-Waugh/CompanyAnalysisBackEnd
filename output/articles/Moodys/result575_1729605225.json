Factories and ports closed as nations in much of the world shut down their\neconomies at different times to contain the highly infectious virus. Production and shipping were\ndisrupted, resulting in shortages for a wide range of goods, much higher transportation costs, and inflation. In\nthis note, we estimate the macroeconomic impact of these supply-chain disruptions on the U.S. economy.\nSupply-chain problems first became evident in summer 2020 after nations partially reopened from the ini-\ntial severe lockdowns. Demand for globally produced and shipped goods surged as households sheltering in\nplace shifted their spending from activities such as travel, restaurants, recreational activities and other ser-\nvices (see Chart 1). Highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies in much of the world also helped\nsupport household incomes and spending.\nChart 1: Goods Demand Surges at Reopening\nReal consumer spending, Feb 2020=100\n125\nTotal spending\n115 Goods spending\nServices spending Pre-pandemicgrowth\n105\n95\nReal consumer spending has grown 2.3% per\n85 annum during the pandemic, compared with 2.4%\nin the two yrsprior to the pandemic.\n75\n18 19 20 21 22\nSources: BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nApril 2022 1\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MacroeconoMic consequences of PandeMic-related Global suPPly-chain disruPtions 2This stress in global supply chains is evident in our supply-chain stress indexes for the U.S. and Chi-\nna (see Chart 2). These indexes are a statistical compilation of a range of measures including glob-\nal freight rates, purchasing managers’ survey results, and labor availability in the transportation and\nwarehousing industries.\nChart 2: Supply-Chain Stresses Ease\nSupply-Chain Stress Index, Oct 2019=100\n150\nThe Supply-Chain Stress Index includes 14 indicators of\n140 bottlenecks in the supply chain, such as supplier delivery\nindexes from regional manufacturing surveys and job China U.S.\n130 openings for workers in transportation and warehousing.\n120\nMore stressed than pre-pandemic normal\n110\n100\n90\n80\nLess stressed than pre-pandemic normal\n70\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\nSources: Multiple statistical sources, Moody’s Analytics\nApril 2022 2\nGlobal supply-chain problems intensified in 2021, especially in the summer and fall as the Delta variant of\nthe virus causing COVID-19 swept across the world, causing severe disruptions to industrial activity and\nshipping. Delta was notably tough on what at the time was a lightly vaccinated Asia, where most supply\nchains begin. Factories shut down throughout much of Southeast Asia and China’s zero-COVID policy\nresulted in widespread port closures. Shortages of everything from semiconductors to plumbing fixtures\nquickly developed, inventories evaporated, and goods prices soared. Our supply-chain stress indexes sug-\ngest that the apex of supply-chain bottlenecks was in September at the height of the Delta wave, when the\nU.S. stress index spiked to nearly 150% of its pre-pandemic base.\nSupply-chain stresses have since eased. Fortunately, the fast-moving Omicron wave that first appeared in\nDecember did only modest new damage to supply chains. Asian vaccination rates are now among the high-\nest in the world, and businesses have begun to address the most severe supply bottlenecks. Semiconductor\nproduction, for example, has picked up and allowed the chip-reliant vehicle industry to ramp up output. Ve-\nhicle inventories will start to build this summer, and vehicle prices will come back to earth soon thereafter.\nMore broadly, global trade rebounded smartly beginning at the end of last year, well ahead of production,\nsuggesting supply-chain disruptions are easing.\nHaving said this, supply-chain stress remains elevated; the U.S. stress index sat at 126% in February. More-\nover, China’s current lockdowns to contain another wave of the virus are severely impacting Shanghai and\nother parts of the country that account for about one-third of the nation’s GDP. This is a reminder of the\nthreat the pandemic continues to pose to supply chains, inflation, and the broader economy.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MacroeconoMic consequences of PandeMic-related Global suPPly-chain disruPtions 3Counterfactual scenario\nTo quantify the impact of scrambled global supply chains on the U.S. economy, we simulated our struc-\ntural model of the global economy under the counterfactual that supply chains and non-energy goods\nconsumer prices were not materially impacted by the pandemic. The counterfactual scenario begins in the\nthird quarter of 2020 to coincide with the start of the supply-chain problems and ends in the first quarter of\n2022, the most recent history for many economic variables.\nThe simulation allows monetary policy and the automatic stabilizers in federal government programs and\nthe tax code to be determined endogenously by the model. We do not consider supply-chain disruptions to\nenergy markets that have occurred since the start of this year, when oil, natural gas, and other commodity\nmarkets began to anticipate a Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nAnother important assumption in the counterfactual scenario is that consumer prices for non-energy goods\nwould have increased 1.6% per annum beginning in the third quarter of 2020. This was our forecast for\nthe coming decade even prior to the pandemic and is consistent with the pace of non-energy goods price\nincreases in the 1990s prior to China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Given heightened trade\ntensions between the U.S. and China in recent years, rising production costs in China, and prospects for a\nstronger Chinese yuan, we have long anticipated higher goods price inflation in the coming years.\nThis assumed price growth for non-energy goods is also approximately consistent with a separate analysis\nwe have performed of the impact of higher transportation costs during the pandemic on consumer price\ninflation. This analysis accounts for transportation costs’ share of overall production input costs, the inter-\nmediate input content of final goods, and the pass-through of producer prices to consumer prices. A good\nrule of thumb is that for a sustained 10% increase in shipping costs, consumer prices ultimately rise 20 to\n30 basis points per annum.\nMacroeconomic impact\nThe economy’s performance in the counterfactual scenario is compared with historical data available\nthrough the first quarter of this year and with our April 2022 baseline economic outlook through the end of\n2024 (see Tables 1-7). Of course, history reflects the economic impact of disrupted supply chains, and our\nforecast assumes that supply chains will largely iron themselves out by this time next year.\nAs the counterfactual scenario shows, the supply-chain disruptions have led to much higher inflation and\nmeaningfully weaker economic growth in the historical period through the first quarter of this year. Con-\nsumer price inflation, which was a painfully high 7.8% on a year-over-year basis through the first quarter of\nthis year, is instead 4.5% in the counterfactual scenario. While still well above the Federal Reserve’s infla-\ntion target of no higher than 2.5%, without the global supply disruptions inflation would not have become\nnearly the problem that it has.\nIt is worth noting that this estimated inflation impact of the supply-chain disruptions is larger than one\nbased on simply adding up the contribution to the acceleration in inflation from higher prices for final\ngoods directly impacted by supply-chain issues, such as vehicles, furniture and consumer electronics, to\nname a few. That is because our model simulation also captures the inflation effects of supply-chain disrup-\ntions on intermediate goods that ultimately impact final goods\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MacroeconoMic consequences of PandeMic-related Global suPPly-chain disruPtions 4Table 1: Consumer Price Impact of Supply-Chain Disruptions\nHistory No supply-chain disruptions Difference\n1982-1984=100 Ann. growth % chg yr ago 1982-1984=100 Ann. growth % chg yr ago % Diff\n2020Q1 258.6 1.3 2.1 258.6 1.3 2.1 0.0\n2020Q2 256.4 -3.4 0.4 256.4 -3.4 0.4 0.0\n2020Q3 259.4 4.8 1.3 258.6 3.4 0.9 -0.3\n2020Q4 260.9 2.2 1.2 259.8 1.9 0.8 -0.4\n2021Q1 263.5 4.1 1.9 262.7 4.6 1.6 -0.3\n2021Q2 268.8 8.2 4.8 265.1 3.6 3.4 -1.4\n2021Q3 273.2 6.7 5.3 267.6 3.8 3.5 -2.0\n2021Q4 278.4 7.9 6.7 271.1 5.4 4.3 -2.6\n2022Q1 284.1 8.4 7.8 274.6 5.3 4.5 -3.3\n2020 258.8 1.2 258.4 1.1 -0.2\n2021 271.0 4.7 266.6 3.2 -1.6\nNote: Gray shaded area represents actual history\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nTable 2: Real GDP Impact of Supply-Chain Disruptions\nHistory No supply-chain disruptions Difference\n2012$ bil Ann. growth 2012$ bil Ann. growth 2012$ bil\n2020Q1 18,952 -5.1 18,952 -5.1 0\n2020Q2 17,258 -31.2 17,258 -31.2 0\n2020Q3 18,561 33.8 18,572 34.1 11\n2020Q4 18,768 4.5 18,793 4.8 25\n2021Q1 19,056 6.3 19,087 6.4 32\n2021Q2 19,368 6.7 19,497 8.9 129\n2021Q3 19,479 2.3 19,833 7.1 354\n2021Q4 19,806 6.9 20,081 5.1 275\n2020 18,385 -3.4 18,394 -3.4 9\n2021 19,427 5.7 19,625 6.7 197\nNote: Gray shaded area represents history\nSources: BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nTable 3: Nonfarm Employment Impact of Supply-Chain Disruptions\nHistory No supply-chain disruptions Difference\nMil Change, mil Mil Change, mil Mil\n2020Q1 151.9 0.3 151.9 0.3 0.0\n2020Q2 133.8 -18.1 133.8 -18.1 0.0\n2020Q3 140.5 6.7 140.5 6.8 0.1\n2020Q4 142.5 2.0 142.6 2.1 0.2\n2021Q1 143.7 1.3 144.0 1.3 0.3\n2021Q2 145.2 1.5 145.7 1.7 0.5\n2021Q3 146.9 1.7 147.6 1.9 0.7\n2021Q4 148.6 1.8 149.7 2.0 1.0\n2022Q1 150.4 1.8 151.8 2.1 1.4\n2020 142.1 -8.7 142.2 -8.7 0.1\n2021 146.1 4.0 146.7 4.5 0.6\nNote: Gray shaded area represents history\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MacroeconoMic consequences of PandeMic-related Global suPPly-chain disruPtions 5Table 4: Unemployment Rate Impact of Supply-Chain Disruptions\nHistory No supply-chain disruptions Difference\n% % %\n2020Q1 3.8 3.8 0.0\n2020Q2 13.0 13.0 0.0\n2020Q3 8.8 8.8 0.0\n2020Q4 6.8 6.7 -0.1\n2021Q1 6.2 6.1 -0.1\n2021Q2 5.9 5.7 -0.2\n2021Q3 5.1 5.0 -0.1\n2021Q4 4.2 4.3 0.0\n2022Q1 3.8 3.4 -0.4\n2020 8.1 8.1 0.0\n2021 5.4 5.3 -0.1\nNote: Gray shaded area represents history\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nTable 5: New-Vehicle Sales Impact of Supply-Chain Disruptions\nApr 2022 baseline No supply-chain disruptions Difference\nMil Change, mil Mil Change, mil Mil\n2020Q1 15.0 -1.9 15.0 -1.9 0.0\n2020Q2 11.3 -3.7 11.3 -3.7 0.0\n2020Q3 15.4 4.1 15.4 4.2 0.0\n2020Q4 16.2 0.8 16.3 0.9 0.1\n2021Q1 16.8 0.6 17.0 0.7 0.2\n2021Q2 16.9 0.1 17.0 0.0 0.1\n2021Q3 13.3 -3.5 16.9 -0.1 3.6\n2021Q4 12.9 -0.5 16.9 -0.0 4.0\n2022Q1 14.9 2.0 17.1 0.2 2.3\n2020 142.1 -8.7 14.5 -8.7 0.0\n2021 146.1 4.0 17.0 2.4 2.0\nNote: Gray shaded area represents history\nSources: BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nTable 6: Federal Funds Rate Impact of Supply-Chain Disruptions\nApr 2022 No supply-chain disruptions Difference\n% % %\n2020Q1 1.2 1.2 0.0\n2020Q2 0.1 0.1 0.0\n2020Q3 0.1 0.1 0.0\n2020Q4 0.1 0.1 0.0\n2021Q1 0.1 0.1 0.0\n2021Q2 0.1 0.1 0.0\n2021Q3 0.1 0.1 0.0\n2021Q4 0.1 0.3 0.2\n2022Q1 0.1 0.7 0.6\n2020 0.4 0.4 0.0\n2021 0.1 0.1 0.1\nNote: Gray shaded area represents history\nSources: Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MacroeconoMic consequences of PandeMic-related Global suPPly-chain disruPtions 6Table 7: 10-Year Treasury Yield Impact of Supply-Chain Disruptions\nApr 2022 No supply-chain disruptions Difference\n% % %\n2020Q1 1.4 1.4 0.0\n2020Q2 0.7 0.7 0.0\n2020Q3 0.7 0.7 0.0\n2020Q4 0.9 1.0 0.1\n2021Q1 1.3 1.4 0.1\n2021Q2 1.6 1.7 0.1\n2021Q3 1.3 1.7 0.4\n2021Q4 1.5 1.9 0.4\n2022Q1 2.0 2.4 0.5\n2020 0.9 0.9 0.0\n2021 1.4 1.7 0.2\nNote: Gray shaded area represents history\nSources: Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nprices. The poster child for this would be building materials, which add to construction costs and eventually\nto the cost of housing services.\nReal GDP is also meaningfully higher in the counterfactual scenario. As of the fourth quarter of 2021, the\nmost recent available history, real GDP is $275 billion, or 1.4%, higher in the counterfactual. That is, if not\nfor the global supply-chain problems, real GDP would have been 1.4% higher at the end of last year. The\nbiggest hit to real GDP was $354 billion, or 1.8%, when the Delta wave was doing its most serious damage\nto supply chains and the economy in the third quarter of last year.\nThe biggest lift to GDP in the counterfactual scenario comes from greater vehicle sales and production.\nGlobal vehicle markets have been badly disrupted by a string of supply-chain issues, most notable when the\nDelta wave forced Asian semiconductor plants to stop operations in the fall. The resulting chip shortages\nhammered global vehicle production, causing vehicle inventories to collapse and vehicle prices to surge. We\nestimate there would have been 2 million more vehicle sales in 2021 if supply chains had been able to func-\ntion normally. Homebuilding has also been significantly impaired, as builders have been unable to get the\nmaterials needed to complete homes because of supply-chain problems. Evidence of this is the near record\nmore than 1.6 million single- and multifamily homes in some stage of completion. Dynamics in vehicle and\nhouse prices have contributed meaningfully to movements in the CPI.\nWith higher GDP in the counterfactual scenario, there are also more jobs and lower unemployment. If there\nhad been no supply-chain disruptions, employment would have been 1.4 million jobs higher as of the first\nquarter of this year, the most recent history available, and the unemployment rate would have been 3.4%,\nor 0.4 percentage point lower. Limiting the decline in unemployment in the scenario is a bigger and sooner\nincrease in labor force participation and foreign immigration as the tighter labor market and stronger wage\ngrowth attract more people into the labor force faster.\nGiven the stronger growth and lower unemployment, and despite the lower inflation, the Federal Reserve\nbegins to normalize monetary policy more quickly in the counterfactual scenario, which also helps push up\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MacroeconoMic consequences of PandeMic-related Global suPPly-chain disruPtions 7long-term interest rates more quickly. Both the federal funds rate and 10-year Treasury yield are about 0.5\npercentage point higher as of this year’s first quarter in the counterfactual scenario than they actually were.\nConclusions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a massive supply-side shock to the economy, hurting growth and lifting\ninflation. The surprising, unprecedented scrambling of global supply chains has been a critical aspect of this\nsupply-side blow. It undermined the economy’s ability to produce and deliver goods, causing shortages, lift-\ning inflation and destroying demand. No doubt, even if there had not been severe supply-chain problems,\nthe economy still would have struggled mightily and inflation still would be uncomfortably high, but this\nanalysis shows that this struggle would not have been nearly as difficult or prolonged.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MacroeconoMic consequences of PandeMic-related Global suPPly-chain disruPtions 8About the Authors\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
