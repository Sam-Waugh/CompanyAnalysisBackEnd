Moody’s Analytics has created a Country Risk Service that will allow\nclients the ability to assess the risks across several dimensions using a suite of indicators. Risks for some\nbusinesses may tilt more heavily toward exchange rate or transfer risk or sovereign debt risk, and we provide a\nsolution that gives clients the flexibility to leverage our data and analysis to assess their risk profile.\nThe core of our risk service is the Moody’s Analytics Country Risk Index, which assesses risk of 188 countries along six risk dimensions. The\nindex incorporates more than 100 metrics, as well as country-expert opinions. In addition, users have the option of adjusting weights across the\nsix dimensions to produce scores that more accurately match their risk preferences. As the broadest measure of risk, the MACRI sets the relative\nlevels of long-run risk across the globe.\nTo complement the MACRI’s broad view of risk, Moody’s Analytics has developed risk measures of specific short-run events. While Venezuela\nmight be riskier than Chile in the MACRI due to systemic differences, at a given point in time Chile might be closer to a recession or a currency\ndepreciation than Venezuela. Our risk service provides four different elements focused on short-run risk.\nA recession can easily disrupt operations and transform revenue projections. Therefore, we developed a risk of recession metric that esti-\nmates the probability of a recession occurring over the subsequent 12 months. This product covers the 105 countries that Moody’s Analytics\nforecasts. Every month new estimates are calculated using the most recent high-frequency data series possible for each country.\nWhile recessions can sometimes cause depreciation of a currency, depreciation events can happen more quickly and be just as disruptive to\na firm’s operations. Our Currency Depreciation Index provides users a view as to where depreciation events are most likely to occur across 108\ndifferent countries. This indicator is updated monthly and estimates the risk over both the short and medium term.\nGovernment debt crises can interact with currency valuations and disrupt credit markets. To measure risks associated with government debt,\nwe have developed a measure of fiscal space for 77 of the countries that we forecast. We define fiscal space as the amount of additional borrow-\ning, above current debt (as measured as the percent of GDP), that a country is capable of without endangering debt sustainability.\nData and forecasts serve as the foundation for all our country risk metrics. Our final risk measure uses that data in a slightly different way to\nmeasure the short-run economic performance of a country. The economic surprise and clarity indexes inform users about how the most recent\ndata stack up against our forecast and a country’s historical performance. Has the country overperformed our forecasts? Or has it underper-\nformed relative to its history? This is a broader view than the other short-run risk measures and is more focused on the economy and a shorter\ntime frame than the MACRI.\nMoody’s Analytics Country Risk Service provides clients with the ability to assess risk in many ways and provides flexibility for users to focus\non the risks that are most critical to their operations. Our risk service views several dimensions of risk as well as multiple time horizons to gen-\nerate as complete a picture as possible. Further risk measures will be added, and as with all Moody’s products, the underlying data and models\nwill continue to be monitored, maintained and improved.\nMACRI – Moody’s Analytics Country Risk Index\nThe MACRI aggregates threats faced along multiple dimensions of risk and uncertainty into a single country risk score, ranging from 0 to\n100. This score is computed from a weighted average of numeric scores assigned to six specific categories of risk. Each of these risk scores is\ncalculated by transforming, weighting and aggregating across a vector of quantitative and qualitative risk metrics, together with subjective risk\nratings produced by Moody’s Analytics country analysts.\nThe value of a risk indicator depends on its ability to condense data of high dimensionality into a specific ranking. But it must do so in a way\nthat preserves definitional clarity, by not conflating too many different types of risk into a single, vaguely defined category. To strike a balance\nbetween too little and too much data aggregation, the MACRI provides risk assessments for six distinct dimensions of economic or sociopolit-\nical risk. As a result, rather than simply stating a single overall risk ranking for a country, or a ranking of a vague concept such as “political risk,”\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Moody’s AnAlytics country risk service 2it allows users to create their own risk assessments by choosing their own weighting across specific, well-defined categories of risk. The six cate-\ngories are as follows:\n» Macroeconomic risk, related to the natural cyclicality of the economy and the quality of monetary and fiscal policy;\n» Microeconomic (or business) risk, reflecting operational uncertainty from local conditions that businesses face on a daily basis;\n» Financial (or balance sheet) risk, related to the possibility of shifts in asset and liability valuations due to interest-rate and ex-\nchange-rate shocks;\n» Social risk, related to the probability of either large-scale social upheaval or individual-level risks such as crime and disease that affect\nhuman resources;\n» Political risk, reflecting policy uncertainty and/or the possibility of large shifts in political conditions; and\n» Security risk, reflecting the risk to human life and property from war, terrorism, geopolitical instability, natural disasters and\nclimate change.\nRisk scores are constructed for each country along each of these risk categories by aggregating across a vector of country characteristics\nassociated with, or otherwise predictive of, that specific risk concept. The MACRI also incorporates the subjective risk assessments of country\nanalysts to complement the objective risk assessments generated by the data. This helps to overcome the principal shortcoming of risk metrics\nconstructed from historical data, which is that they are backward-looking, depending upon frequency of events in the past rather than their\nlikelihood in the future. For example, the standard deviation of growth and inflation rates over the last few decades is a useful measure of past\nmacroeconomic volatility but may be an imperfect measure of current conditions or future performance.\nBy contrast, the use of these objective data-driven risk measures helps to ground subjective risk assessments and reduce any bias toward\noverweighting recent events or simply reproducing an assessment of what might be considered common knowledge. Combining both ap-\nproaches—objective and subjective—allows for a more accurate and reliable estimate of country risk.\nThe MACRI is updated quarterly. While most of the data underpinning the country risk score are published annually, macroeconomic and finan-\ncial measures are often updated at a much higher frequency. In addition, subjective measures determined by Moody’s Analytics country analysts\ncan be updated quarterly in order to factor in their most recent qualitative judgments that may not yet be reflected in the quantitative measures.\nEven so, because many of the metrics used—such as averages and standard deviations—evolve slowly with each new datapoint, the set of\nobjective risk metrics typically changes gradually from year to year. This is as it should be, for risk—as compared with a forecast—reflects the\ndistribution of all possibilities rather than a single expected outcome.\nCDI – Currency Depreciation Index\nMoody’s Analytics has developed a model to assess the vulnerability of a country’s real effective exchange rate. Research on the determi-\nnants of foreign exchange posit many plausible variables that influence exchange rates, and we use that rich literature to inform the basis of our\nmodel. As a result, our Currency Depreciation Index provides clients with a data-driven indicator covering 105 countries.\nOur methodology relies on a regression model with known currency crisis explanatory variables to generate monthly forecasts of the proba-\nbility of a future currency depreciation event. We then construct an indicator based on predicted probabilities generated by our model.\nIn our model a depreciation event is defined by two alternative criteria: 1) a 3% decrease in the real effective exchange rate over one\nmonth, or 2) no change in a three-month period when there is a greater than 5% decrease in foreign reserves. The second criterion reflects\nwhen a currency might have depreciation but for the intervention of the central bank. Many central banks either target an exchange rate\nor seek to minimize exchange rate volatility. Without including these “nonevents” one would underestimate the importance of currency\ndepreciation predictors.\nWe regress our event variable on known currency crisis variables such as exchange rate volatility, exchange rate overvaluation, trade bal-\nances, and import cover using panel regression techniques. While a panel regression typically leads one to consider fixed effects to capture the\ntime-insensitive probability that one country’s currency might have a higher or lower likelihood of depreciating, we choose to use a random\neffects model over fixed effects.\nFixed effects have two downsides that we would like to avoid. First, fixed effects eliminate our ability to include dummy variables that group\ncountries together because of perfect multicollinearity. For example, we might expect that currencies under a currency peg regime would have\na lower probability of experiencing a depreciation. Second, fixed effects limit our ability to cluster errors. We prefer clustering errors because we\nhave an unbalanced panel and those countries with the smallest panels are also candidates for exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the con-\ncept of clustering errors fits in line with the idea of risk; those countries that have larger errors are riskier.\nIn addition, we forecast over multiple horizons and average across horizons to utilize all available information. A one-month-ahead\nforecasting model can project out one year, but errors compound and therefore are quite large. In contrast, a one-year-ahead forecast-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Moody’s AnAlytics country risk service 3ing model has smaller errors on the 12-month horizon but does not use the most recent data when forecasting the coming month. By\naveraging across the suite of forecasting models, we make the most of recent data while still maintaining narrow forecast errors over\nlonger horizons.\nWe use the predicted probability of a currency depreciation to construct an indicator that incorporates both the global percentile and the\ncountry-specific percentile. The global percentile is the percentile of the predicted probability in the whole dataset (>31,000 observations),\nwhereas the country-specific percentile is the percentile within the country’s history. Thus, a country receives a high rank when its predicted\nprobability is high relative to the rest of the world and to its own historical experience.\nRisk of recession\nTo assess what financial markets and the economic data are telling us about the odds of a recession, we create separate economic and finan-\ncial market probit models. Our application uses the normal distribution to convert the two results into a probability of recession over the com-\ning 12 months. These models were first developed and tested by Moody’s Analytics to develop a model of the odds of recession in the U.S. This\nmodel has been extended for use across 105 countries.\nFor the current exercise, we extend the time horizon to 12 months and focus entirely on national economic and financial variables provided\nat a monthly frequency for all 105 countries forecast in the Moody’s Analytics Global Macroeconomic Model. We focus simply on the ability of\nthe economic and financial variables to separately signal a recession rather than on their success in forecasting economic activity. We acknowl-\nedge that the best predictor of recessions is likely a combination of financial and economic indicators.\nOur approach uses a broader definition of recession, involving measures of consumption, employment, asset prices and industrial output\nrather than what many are taught in principles of macroeconomics: that a recession is two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. Because\nrecessions are discrete events, the recession status is denoted using 0 or 1 in the probit model. If the economy is in recession, a 1 is assigned to\neach month of the downturn. If the economy is not in recession, the dependent variable equals zero. The probability of a recession in 12 months\nis determined using information in the current period.\nIn constructing the models, we face a trade-off between more observations capturing more recessions, and sacrificing potentially significant\nindicators that offer more explanatory power. For more data-rich economies, a variety of statistically significant variables providing strong ex-\nplanatory power can be included in the model without sacrificing a substantial number of observations. For example, Australia’s model provides\n485 monthly observations dating back to 1980 with terms for a number of commodities, industries and consumer variables, achieving an ad-\njusted R2 of 0.39. In other instances, such as Brazil, the most statistically significant data series only begin in the early 2000s.\nFiscal space\nFiscal space measures the additional debt-financed spending, expressed as a percent of GDP, that a national government can do without\nputting debt sustainability or market access at risk. Arithmetically, fiscal space is computed as the difference between an estimate of each\ncountry’s maximum sustainable debt ratio and its current debt ratio. The estimated maximum sustainable debt ratio primarily depends on three\nkey factors:\n» A projection of the maximum sustainable primary balance.1 This is estimated from each nation’s current and historical budget surpluses\nand deficits.\n» The government’s current long-term borrowing rate. This is an indicator of current and future interest costs and incorporates current in-\nvestor perceptions of risk and the effects of currency and monetary regimes on interest rates.\n» Projected nominal output growth. Faster economic growth expands available budget resources to service debt.\nA higher sustainable debt-to-GDP ratio and, hence, greater fiscal space will result from a higher primary balance, lower borrowing rate, and\nhigher GDP growth rate. However, high volatility of these factors will lead to lower estimated sustainable debt and fiscal space because the\ngovernment needs to maintain a precautionary buffer against the risk of experiencing a large enough shock to trigger a runaway debt spiral or\na spike in borrowing costs. The estimates account for crowding out effects, which reduce fiscal space because a larger government debt crowds\nout investment, leading to a smaller capital stock, higher interest rates, and lower growth rates. They also account for the additional risks posed\nby debt denominated in foreign currencies and the term structure of debt, with countries that have a lot of short-term debt generally facing\nlarger risks of being unable to roll over their debt.\nTo produce the monthly updated estimates for more than 70 countries, we maintain a time series database of budget, national output and\nprice level statistics compiled from data published by national statistical agencies, the International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. We select\nbudget line items to ensure consistency of the concepts for making debt sustainability calculations and make adjustments as needed to increase\ncomparability. We augment the database with market yields on long-term sovereign debt for each country, using a proxy for countries where\nthis information is unavailable, as an indicator of long-term government borrowing costs and market access.\n1 Primary balance is defined as government revenues less noninterest expenditures expressed as a percent of GDP.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Moody’s AnAlytics country risk service 4We validate the estimates by computing time series estimates of fiscal space for each country and comparing the projections through time\nand across countries with other indicators of debt sustainability and market access such as credit default swaps, ratings, and simple debt ratios.\nOur fiscal space estimates have predictive value for assessing risks of sovereign default or projecting which countries will be constrained in their\nfiscal policies when responding to recessions and crises.\nEconomic clarity and surprise indexes\nUncertainty about economic conditions can present a risk to firms. That uncertainty comes from multiple sources: data quality, data volume,\nand the signal-to-noise ratio. To assist clients in assessing current economic conditions, we have created two indexes that measure the degree\nto which an economy is over- or underperforming. Our metrics give clients the ability to quickly assess what the most recent data have to say\nabout all of the countries that Moody’s Analytics forecasts.\nRelying on a single data series such as industrial production to assess the strength or weakness of an economy has many pitfalls. Some series\nare more correlated with economic activity in one country than in another, making cross-country comparison challenging. Other series are not\nupdated very frequently or with significant lag and therefore provide only a weak signal.\nTo address these concerns, we aggregate and sort series into sectors such as labor markets or trade. The weights used in aggregations are de-\ntermined by the frequency and time lag of each series. Then we calculate the correlation of that sector with economic activity, which is defined\nas GDP growth, to sort each sector into tiers so that highly correlated sectors receive more weight in the final index score.\nIn order to normalize, we consider whether the economy is underperforming or overperforming expectations and/or history. Both bench-\nmarks are important; having both can give users a nuanced view of current performance. An economy that is underperforming history but\noverperforming forecasting could indicate a strong bounce after a recession. An economy that is underperforming both history and forecast is\nheading for a deep recession. This is why we have an economic surprise index that is related to forecast and an economic clarity index that is\nrelated to history.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Moody’s AnAlytics country risk service 5Summary of Moody’s Analytics Country Risk Methodology\nThe Moody’s Analytics Country Risk Indicator is constructed as a weighted sum of six sub-indexes, each capturing some dimension of economic or\nsocio-political risk. Each subindex is, in turn, constructed using an aggregation of standardized values for a range of indicators. These indicators\nare listed in the table below. The standardized values of each variable were averaged, and then converted into a percentile under the assumption of\na normal distribution. Thus, each subindex is a value from 0 to 100, which can be interpreted as a percentile. A country with a risk score of 54 for\n“economic stability” can be thought of as being positioned at the 54th percentile in the distribution of all countries with respect to that risk factor.\n(This is in terms of all hypothetically possible countries, not the actual sample of countries: thus several countries could be scored at the 54th\npercentile, and none at the 56th percentile).\nVariables Used in the Construction of the Country Risk Indicators\nSource\nDimensions of Economic Risk\nMacoreconomic Risk\nEconomic Stability (risks associated with the cyclicality of real activity)\nGross National Income, (log, PPP international $) World Bank, IMF\nGrowth risk, (std. deviation of the growth rate minus average) IMF, Moody’s Analytics\nIndex of recession risk, over next 12 months Various Sources, Moody’s Analytics\nEconomic structure and performance: gross investment, (% of GDP) Moody’s Investors Service\nOpenness, (sum of exports plus imports as % of GDP) Moody’s Investors Service\nCPIA macroeconomic management rating World Bank\nMacroeconomic contagion Moody’s Analytics\nMonetary Stability (risk of shocks to the price and quantity of credit)\nInflation risk, (log of rolling std. deviation of monthly inflation rate) IMF, Moody’s Analytics\nLiquidity risk, (log of rolling std. deviation of annual growth in credit as % of GDP) Moody’s Investors Service, Moody’s Analytics\nPolicy risk, (rolling std. deviation of real monetary policy rate) Moody’s Investors Service, Moody’s Analytics\nCurrent inflation rate, (end of period, annual % chg) IMF, Moody’s Analytics\nReal interest rate, (rolling std. deviation) World Bank, Moody’s Analytics\nFiscal Stability (risks related to tax rates and sovereign default)\nGeneral government gross debt, (% of GDP) IMF\nGeneral government net lending/borrowing, (% of GDP) IMF\nGovernment interest payments, (% of GDP) IMF\nGovernment effectiveness index, (standarized aggregation of primary surveys) World Bank\nFiscal policy uncertainty, (std. deviation of structural balance as % of GDP) IMF, Moody’s Analytics\nCPIA fiscal policy rating, (index) World Bank\nCPIA debt policy rating, (index) World Bank\nMoody’s Implied Soverign Risk Rating Moody’s Investor Services\nBusiness Risk\nRisks related to operations\nAccess to finance, (% of firms identifying as a major obstacle) World Bank\nElectricity, (% of firms identifying as a major obstacle) World Bank\nPower outages in a typical month, (log number) World Bank, Moody’s Analytics\nDuration of a typical electrical outage, (log number of hours) World Bank, Moody’s Analytics\nAverage number of incidents of water insufficiency in a typical month, (log number) World Bank, Moody’s Analytics\nFirms paying for security, (% of firms surveyed) World Bank\nLosses due to theft and vandalism against the, (% of annual sales) World Bank\nSecurity costs, (% of annual sales) World Bank\nProducts shipped to supply domestic markets lost due to theft, (% of product value) World Bank\nCrime, theft and disorder, (% of firms identifying as a major constraint) World Bank\nRisks related to uncertaintyof regulatory and market environment\nLicenses and permits, (% of firms identifying as a major obstacle) World Bank\nCustoms & trade regulations, (% of firms identifying as a major obstacle) World Bank\nAverage time to clear imports from customs, (days) World Bank\nGovernment or state ownership, (% of firms) World Bank\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Moody’s AnAlytics country risk service 6Summary of Moody’s Analytics Country Risk Methodology (Cont.)\nVariables Used in the Construction of the Country Risk Indicators\nSource\nMarket capitalization excluding top 10 companies, (% of total market capitalization) World Bank\nFirms using Email to communicate with clients and suppliers, (%) World Bank\nPractices of competitors in the informal sector, (% of firms identifying as a major constraint) World Bank\nCorruption, (% of firms identifying as a major constraint) World Bank\nFirms with annual financial statement reviewed by external auditor, (%) World Bank\nSenior management time spent in dealing with requirements of government regulation, (%) World Bank\nFirms identifying labor regulations as a major constraint, (%) World Bank\nEase of doing business index, (1=most business-friendly regulations) World Bank\nTime required to enforce a contract, (days) World Bank\nFirms competing against unregistered or informal firms, (%) World Bank\nFirms formally registered when started operations in the country, (%) World Bank\nFirms using banks to finance investments, (%) World Bank\nWorking capital financed by supplier credit, (%) World Bank\nElectronic payments used to make payments -
