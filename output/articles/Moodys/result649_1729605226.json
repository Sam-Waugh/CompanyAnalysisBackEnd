Senior risk executives at banks\nSenior Engagement Advisor,\nMoody’s Analytics have always held risk appetite as one of their key priorities to continually define and re-optimize their\nportfolios in response to macroeconomic volatility. Attention to risk appetite by bank executives gets\nContact Us\nmagnified during economic downturns. Regulators, however, keep a steady eye on risk appetite in good\nAmericas +1.212.553.1653\ntimes and bad. They have pressed banks to develop risk appetite statements, establish strong reporting\nEurope +44.20.7772.5454\nand monitoring infrastructure, provide better clarity around roles and responsibilities, and ensure that\nAsia-Pacific +852.3551.3077\nstrict policies and guidelines are established.\nJapan +81.3.5408.4100\nBanks have responded with efforts to improve their risk management capabilities and remediate\nregulatory concerns. Yet challenges remain in raising risk appetite measures to the level of top\nmanagement and making them relevant to downstream business units on a day-to-day basis, linking\nrisk appetite to business decisions and having appropriate business metrics to monitor. Banks continue\nto face communication challenges in taking their risk appetite frameworks to the front line and\nsimultaneously relaying the impact of front-line decisions back to the risk appetite limits. In short,\nsuccessfully establishing, implementing, and enforcing risk appetite continues to be challenging.\nThis paper will explore several common risk appetite challenges and how technology can help improve\nrisk appetite frameworks and implementation at banks of all sizes.\nWhat is risk appetite and why is it important?\nRegulators have defined risk appetite as the aggregate level and types of risk a bank’s board of directors\nand management are willing to assume to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan, consistent\nwith applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. From a practical standpoint, credit\nrisk appetite is about setting boundaries around the bank’s credit risk activities. That could take the form\nof setting limits for business divisions, geographical regions, sectors, industries, products, top customers,\nand other customers based on their risk grade.\nRisk appetite is a key component of a bank’s risk management framework. Effective risk management\nis fundamental in ensuring that there is an appropriate balance between risk and reward to maximize\nshareholder returns. In today’s low interest rate environment, bank executives are under increased\npressure from shareholders to deliver earnings growth by rolling out new products and services and\nentering new markets, which means potentially taking on more risk.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nGood risk management does not involve avoiding risk at all costs. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\nInstead, effective risk management implies taking on additional risk as long as the bank is making informed\nchoices regarding the risks it wants to take in pursuit of its objectives and has measures in place to mitigate\nthose risks. Mismanagement of risk appetite will not only bring the ire of regulators, but it can also have\nserious ramifications for the bank. These include incurring losses due to an inappropriate management of\nconcentrations in the portfolio, bad decisions on risk/reward trade-offs, and lack of awareness of hidden risks\nin the portfolio.\nHaving a strong risk appetite statement and well-established policies and procedures is important. Equally\nimportant is the effective implementation of this framework. Critical elements in putting a risk appetite\nframework into action include the ability to monitor, enforce, and report on compliance with risk appetite.\nAnd the ability to do so effectively is dependent on having the right IT infrastructure, systems, data, and\nanalytical capabilities in place.\nFour challenges in implementing a credit risk appetite framework\nBased on discussions with a number of credit risk executives at small and large banks, we have identified four\nkey challenges to implementing an effective credit risk framework:\n1. Ensuring data quality and integrity\n2. Setting appropriate limits\n3. Implementing and enforcing risk appetite limits\n4. Monitoring limits and managing breaches\n2 OCTOBER 2016 TECHNOLOGY: KEY TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n1. ENSURING DATA QUALITY AND INTEGRITY\nOne of the most common risk appetite challenges cited by banking executives is data quality and integrity.\nData quality and integrity not only help establish a clear understanding of risk appetite based on measurable\nmetrics, they are essential to making fair, timely, and accurate credit decisions.\nPoor data quality may lead to poor definition of risk appetite, which in turn leads to unverifiable data\naggregation outputs. Let’s look at an example of how inadequate data can create risk appetite challenges.\nMost banks have concentration limits in place for customer relationships. Thus, when making a credit decision,\na bank needs to have a clear understanding of all products involving credit risk that are tied to that particular\nclient and its related entities. The bank also needs to have a fast and seamless way to see its complete\nexposure to ensure it’s not over-exposed at the time of origination. No banker wants to approve additional\ncredit that would trigger an unnecessary breach of risk appetite limits, especially if a particular sector is\nexperiencing difficulties. But error-prone and inadequate manual processes can have exactly that result.\nAnother issue we’ve heard from banks is that each of their product offerings has a different booking system,\nand these systems do not communicate well with each other. Also, when making acquisitions, banks have\noften neglected to consolidate all their credit risk systems. Multiple sources of risk data resulting from\nacquisitions and multiple types of products can be difficult to bring together. The accumulation of these\nacquisitions together with diverse, unintegrated systems have created significant challenges over the years\nas banks got bigger, putting the spotlight on the issue of data integrity. These data issues require further\nrefinements and validation by the credit and risk teams.\nMaking sure you’re staying within the exposure boundaries of a single-client relationship is not the only\nlimitation in place. Banks have concentration limits for overall products, top customers, industries, and more.\nIn the previous example, we had to aggregate exposure across an entire client relationship. Now we have\nto aggregate the exposures across products, industries, countries, regions, and more. Having to gather that\ninformation manually and source it from different systems, or even spreadsheets, creates a process prone to\nhuman error. It’s also a highly inefficient process, which demands significant man-hours and also creates the\npossibility of not properly sizing risk.\nRegulators are increasingly demanding that a solid risk governance framework should include policies and\nprocesses to provide risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities. In order to accomplish this, banks\nshould have the necessary IT infrastructure to store and archive data and support risk aggregation and\nreporting needs in order to capture material risks, concentrations, and emerging risks in a timely manner.\nTechnology systems today can significantly improve data quality and data aggregation. Current systems offer\none single source of truth, with the ability to gather the various risk data in one system that is easy to view\nand pull information from. There’s no need for checking multiple systems, tracking exposure in spreadsheets,\nadding up numbers, and asking internal groups whether they are aware of any exposure to that particular\nclient. Systems can now offer a detailed view of all subsidiaries of a particular client within that relationship\nhierarchy – and not just loans, but all products. These systems can also aggregate all the exposures across\nproducts, industries, regions, and so forth.\n2. SETTING APPROPRIATE LIMITS\nThis brings us to the limit-setting process. At banks, it is usually the risk management function that is\nresponsible for the design and application of the bank’s risk appetite management framework. Although this\ngroup is typically independent of the bank’s business units, risk executives often complain that their business\ncounterparts don’t participate in setting risk appetite limits. And rightfully so, as the first line of defense\n3 OCTOBER 2016 TECHNOLOGY: KEY TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nmust be the responsibility of the business units and the originators of risk. Hence, the absence of buy-in from\nbusiness unit leaders makes it difficult to set and enforce risk appetite limits.\nAt times, setting risk appetite is not regarded as a paramount issue among business unit leaders, who view\nit as a risk function and are content as long as the limits passed down to them don’t interfere with business\ngrowth. On other occasions, business unit leaders complain that limits are set arbitrarily and there isn’t\nenough business justification for how limits were produced. Relying on an arbitrary and poorly justified set of\nlimits could hamper the ability of business units to drive revenue growth without increasing risk, they argue.\nRegardless, the key question is why do limits tend to be based more on individual judgment rather than\nscientific data? Some common explanations that emerged during our discussions with bankers include:\n» We don’t have the data to conduct the thorough analysis required.\n» We don’t really have the capabilities, resources or time.\n» We could not get business leaders to articulate their tolerance for volatility or loss.\n» Limits were not connected to business strategy because loan forecasts were prepared by finance and risk\nwith limited input from business.\n» We rely too much on risk executives’ gut feelings and experience.\nSome ways to deal with this situation are to align compensation with risk culture and take a collaborative\nand analytical approach to limit setting that is well articulated, tied to business objectives, and clearly\ndemonstrates the consequences of breaching limits.\nIn addition, banks can leverage the significant amount of funding and resources that have already been\nallocated to conduct regulatory stress testing to help set risk appetite limits using an analytical approach.\nUnfortunately, the units preparing the stress testing and limit setting often don’t share the same technology\nand don’t interact with each other.\nMoody’s Analytics is at the forefront of stress testing and risk appetite limit-setting research. We have worked\nto help clients better express their risk appetite limits through a well-defined analytical and quantitative\napproach. This analysis can help tie risk appetite metrics to the strategic direction of the business, which is\nstill a very difficult process in need of improvement. Ultimately, this approach can help risk management set\nappropriate and dynamic limits, reset limits as the market environment changes, obtain business buy-in, and\nimprove the bank’s overall risk culture.\n3. IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING RISK APPETITE LIMITS\nAs discussed above, effective risk appetite can be thwarted by integration challenges between risk, business,\nand other functional areas at banks. This same dynamic influences the implementation of risk appetite\nlimits at the various business units and origination points. Lack of cultural alignment and unoptimized\nprocesses often prevent the risk appetite framework from being adopted by the business units or the point of\norigination, rendering it ineffective.\nSome of the factors that make it difficult to integrate limits across business units and reinforce risk awareness\nat the frontlines are both cultural and process driven and include:\n» Originators of the credits don’t necessarily know the limits in place. (“I didn’t know there was a top 20\ncustomer limit.”)\n» They find it difficult to determine if a certain credit is going to cause capacity issues, because they don’t\nknow where to look.\n4 OCTOBER 2016 TECHNOLOGY: KEY TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n» Limits utilization reports are stored on an internal website which isn’t often updated, so they think they\nhave capacity but they don’t.\n» They couldn’t see all the exposure tied to a customer and missed some that caused the overage.\nClearly, banks still have problems with appropriately sharing all the limits in place with the individuals who\nare originating risk. On the other hand, originators want to spend their time on winning new business and\ngenerating revenues. Finding out who they need to call, where the data is located, knowing all the limits\nout there, and checking if other units may be using up capacity is time stolen from generating business and\nresponding to clients.\nLuckily, new credit origination technology can help mitigate these issues and make the process more efficient\nand proactive. For example, Moody’s Analytics offers solutions that allow bank officers to see at the point of\norigination whether a potential deal is going to breach any risk appetite limits. At that point, before moving\nforward, the red flag is raised if there is a potential limit breach. Originators can then decide to continue the\napproval process and seek an exception or escalate it to higher-ups or even decline the deal. Interestingly,\nhaving an automated mechanism to check limits at the time of origination is not a widely adopted solution\nin the banking industry. At many banks the process is still a highly manual one, consisting of checking reports\nand spreadsheets to ensure compliance, where automation could bring significant benefits in terms of time\nand accuracy.\nA robust origination system with feedback mechanism will make it easy for banks to quickly put in place any\nadditional approval requirements and flag any transactions where limits are close to breach or an industry\nis experiencing rapid deterioration. This also helps the bank remain within its risk appetite limits and closely\nmonitor exceptions. Once banks can immediately disseminate new risk appetite limits, even in a rapidly\nchanging market environment, there can be no excuses that individuals on the frontlines didn’t receive the\nnotice or wrongly thought that they were in compliance.\nThus, automation will make the process more efficient, but also enhance governance around risk appetite\nand overall portfolio management. Additionally, automated technology will allow credit originators to focus\non “non-administrative,” value-added tasks and build stronger relationships with clients.\nAnother factor in enforcing risk appetite limits is cultural alignment. The bank’s risk culture will dictate\nwhether or not business units feel that limits can be breached without much consequence. This really starts\nat the top. Senior business unit leaders need to understand the metrics, contribute to the limit setting, buy\nin to them, and reinforce the message that breaching these limits has consequences. Unfortunately, in reality\nthis is not always the case, leaving the risk appetite framework open to avoidable lapses.\n4. MONITORING LIMITS AND MANAGING BREACHES\nThe topics we have discussed so far may suggest that comparing exposure to limits is an “after the fact”\nprocess – after the deal origination is done – rendering limits management reactive rather than proactive.\nSuch is not the case. As part of building a robust and successful risk appetite framework, banks should\nestablish processes to:\n» Identify real time breaches of the risk appetite statement or concentration risk limits.\n» Establish protocols for quickly disseminating information regarding a breach.\n» Provide details on the breach resolution and any impact on the risk appetite limits.\nThe use of spreadsheets to monitor risk appetite limits is more common than people think. To this day, banks\nspend a considerable amount of time generating reports that aggregate data across multiple systems and\n5 OCTOBER 2016 TECHNOLOGY: KEY TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nsilos. Employees then consolidate the information, conduct various calculations, and compare the results to\nestablished limits. The magnitude of the calculations is amplified by the number and type of credit risk limits\nin place and the complexity of the bank’s portfolio.\nMoreover, reports are usually not prepared on a daily basis. Reports compiled on a bi-weekly or monthly basis\nare usually manually generated and stored in an internal site. There are several problems with this approach:\n» The task of manually aggregating and calculating data is a significant use of resources and time that can be\nbetter spent in client-facing, revenue-generating activities.\n» Manual calculations are subject to human error and thus may not accurately identify and quantify risks.\n» The untimely identification of a breach often means fewer options for resolution. By the time a breach is\nidentified, significant damage may already be done.\nIdentifying limit breaches and near-breaches in a timely manner is critical to a dynamic risk appetite\nmonitoring process. Limits should be reviewed and updated frequently, as changes in market conditions, risk\ntolerance, strategy, or other factors arise. Having ready access to customer and portfolio data, and where\nvarious exposures stand against limits, is essential to make prompt portfolio decisions.\nBreaches must be identified as they occur, automatic alerts sent to the right decision-making individuals at\nthe bank, and the breach and resolution must be well documented so it can be audited in the future. Manual\ncalculation and spreadsheets cannot guarantee this; only a strong IT infrastructure with limits management\ncapabilities can achieve this desired state.\nLimits monitoring should also be about continuous verification of the relationship between the risk taken and\nthe return received. No one wants to hamper business growth, but capital is finite and banks need to make\ndecisions on where to allocate capital to get the best risk/reward balance.\nConclusion\nDespite ongoing work to enhance risk appetite frameworks, there are still gaps that need to be addressed.\nTechnology can deliver significant value to the overall risk appetite process. Systems can provide cost-saving\nefficiency gains, better data quality, and enhanced analytics. And these factors, in turn, drive the ability to\nmeasure, monitor, and adjust risk taken against expressed risk appetite and facilitate communication to\nstakeholders at all levels of the bank.\n6 OCTOBER 2016 TECHNOLOGY: KEY TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORKMMOOOODDYY’’SS AANNAALLYYTTIICCS\n© 2016 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
