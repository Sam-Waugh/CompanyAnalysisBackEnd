It started when the business owner, an individual\nwell-known to the teller, began withdrawing large amounts\nand transferring funds to accounts at other institutions.\nUnderstanding that the business needed cash to repay its\nloans and recognizing that these were unusual transactions\nfor this customer, the teller brought it to the attention\nof branch management, which in turn notified the\nappropriate loan officer and credit administrators. While\nthis customer was neither in default nor engaging in illicit\nactivities, the warning prompted timely conversation\nwith the borrower and allowed the bank to revise\nits credit terms, constraining the diversion of funds to\nother ventures.\nWhile this story highlights the actions of an exceptional employee, it also raises some instructive questions:\nWhat institutional norms empowered To what extent does this employee’s\nthis employee to take this initiative? behavior reflect the values of\nthe institution?\nHow did the employee gain the\nnecessary skills and knowledge to How likely are other employees to\nmake the appropriate judgment? behave in the same fashion?\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 2////////// INVESTING IN SAFETY\nBuilding a foundation of credit skill and knowledge among all employees creates a strong risk management\nculture that protects the financial safety of the institution. Yet most people would say that credit risk is the\nloan officer’s job. So why should a financial institution invest in developing credit skill and knowledge in\nsomeone when it’s “not their job”? Because there are consequences for not doing so.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establishes guidelines that are designed to\nkeep employees safe in the workplace. Unsafe working conditions and practices have consequences, so for\nmost businesses, compliance with OSHA requirements is a given. But what about the financial safety of\nyour institution?\nFirst, let’s examine the consequences of “unsafe credit conditions.” Loans are a financial institution’s biggest\nasset—and biggest risk (even though they may not be the biggest new income generator in today’s\nenvironment). Loans are only profitable when principal is repaid with interest. So what are the costs of\ncharging off a single loan of $100,000? It’s more than the current-period loss of principal and interest.\nIf the bank’s return on assets is 1 percent, in\norder to earn back the loss, the bank would\nneed to make $10,000,000 in new loans that\nall performed for one year. That’s interest on $10MM\n100 new loans of $100,000 each to replace the\n$100K\nprincipal and interest lost on a single $100,000\nbad loan.\n1 BAD LOAN 100 NEW LOANS\nHere's another perspective: If the net interest margin on the bank’s loans is 3 percent, then charging off a\nsingle loan of $500,000 would more than wipe out the total profit contribution from the remaining loans in\na $10,000,000 portfolio.\nClearly, even relatively small proportions of credit losses can adversely impact the financial health of a\nlending institution. Here is a simple syllogism: Everyone’s job is dependent on the health of the institution.\nCredit risk affects the financial health of the institution. Therefore, everyone should care about credit risk.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 3////////// KNOWING YOUR CUSTOMER\nOne of the basic tenets of building and managing relationships is knowing the customer. This is especially\ntrue for credit-based customer relationships; knowing your customer not only helps strengthen the\nrelationship but also detect and avert credit risks. The problem is that banking relationships, particularly\ncredit relationships, are rarely one-dimensional. It takes teamwork to serve and maintain the overall\nrelationship. Each team member, from loan officers to operations specialists to letter of credit processors,\nhas a point of contact with information about the customer, whether through direct or indirect interaction.\nWhat are your team members learning about\ncustomers’ credit risk from their normal, day-to-day\ninteractions with customers?\nAre they asking questions to learn more?\nAre they asking the right questions?\nDo they know how to interpret the customer’s\nanswers?\nK N O W\nAre they noting what they learn?\n— YOUR —\nAre they empowered to act on or disseminate this\nCUSTOMER\ninformation?\nKnowing your customer involves knowing who at your institution has a connection to any part of the\ncustomer relationship. Whether they realize it or not, these individuals can influence credit safety by simply\nunderstanding the nature of risk in the customer information they see and hear. The most highly effective\ncredit-driven organizations do not leave such opportunities to chance.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 4Ensuring that each group has the applicable credit skills and knowledge can contribute to ensuring financial\nsafety for the institution. These groups include:\nSENIOR MANAGEMENT/\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS CREDIT-FOCUSED STAFF OTHER NON-CREDIT UNITS\nMIDDLE MANAGEMENT SALES-FOCUSED STAFF ADMINISTRATIVE AND\nSUPPORT UNITS\n////////// SENIOR MANAGEMENT / BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nThrough meetings and memoranda, the senior management of one regional bank conveys the\nimportance of being a “credit-driven organization” where everyone proactively contributes to\nmanaging credit risk. However, lacking specificity and deliberate top-down drivers to sustain this\nmission, behavior down the organization becomes inconsistent, increasing risk and diminishing the\nimpact of senior management’s message.\nSenior management has a responsibility to ensure the financial safety of the institution. There is little room\nfor error at the top, because this is where accountability for institutional credit risk must begin and end.\nSenior management is responsible for:\nEstablishing and communicating goals, objectives, and strategies related to credit risk\nBalancing credit risk and short-term growth/profits\nCreating and enforcing credit policies and practices\nClarifying the organizational structure to support efficient risk management\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 5In high-performing credit cultures, senior management conveys its commitment to the financial safety of\nthe organization by initiating and fostering an institution-wide respect for managing credit risk. Leaders\nshould visibly support the cultivation and use of credit skills at all levels of the organization to draw\nattention to the issue and develop trust among those who are expected to execute credit policies and\nstrategies. Senior management must also watch for and address the inevitable imbalances between the\ncompeting priorities of managing credit risk and short-term revenue or asset growth. These imbalances will\ninvariably result in poor financial performance, or worse.\nAfter receiving an infusion of equity capital from its new owner, the senior management of a\nregional bank was determined to generate quick results by aggressively lending in the commercial\nreal estate market throughout the state. While the bank was able to book new loans of an amount\nmultiple times its new capital, it was also able to generate substantial fee income, primarily\nbecause many of the borrowers were of higher credit risk. Management assumed that the\nunderlying value of real estate collateral would mitigate this risk…until it didn’t.\nMisguided executive leadership is demonstrated in more than just such blatant examples. Most anecdotes\nof effective and ineffective credit risk practices at all levels can be traced back to senior management.\nThis is not to suggest that senior management must micromanage or oversee all activities that may\ncontribute to credit risk. The point is that when it comes to credit risk, senior management must lead the\nway, early and often. They must communicate regularly about this priority and ensure that all systems and\nincentives are aligned to support it, instead of simply setting a goal, monitoring, and hoping everyone else\nfollows through.\n////////// MIDDLE MANAGEMENT\nA financial institution followed a practice of absorbing loan charge-offs centrally while basing\nbonuses on profit at the group level. After some deliberation, this practice was changed so\nthat each group was required to absorb its own loan losses on its respective P&L . Driving\naccountability down the chain sharpened focus on credit risk, resulted in a higher-quality\nportfolio, and improved profitability.\nWhile the vignette above might appear to be an example of senior management leadership, it also\nillustrates the impact of driving responsibility and accountability for credit safety to the appropriate levels.\nIn many instances, credit risk practices are most tangibly felt at divisional or departmental levels and below.\nMiddle management plays a crucial role in ensuring the credit safety of the institution. Middle managers\nare the bridge between senior managers and employees, and like senior managers, they must exhibit and\nreinforce credit risk management practices.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 6Middle managers are responsible for:\nImplementing and executing credit strategies\nOverseeing their units’ credit-related activities\nProviding credit coaching and mentoring\nMiddle managers must interpret and enforce risk management practices within their units, as well\nas adjudicate conflicts with other units. For example, conflicts can occur when one department has\nprimary responsibility for underwriting credit risk while another department originates the deals. Middle\nmanagement must balance the tension between these two areas. Layers also exist in functions not directly\ninvolved in credit underwriting or origination. Here, successful middle managers embrace the institution’s\nrisk philosophy and translate its applicability to the actions of these units. One of the most important tasks\nof middle managers in all functions is coaching and mentoring their staff. This is particularly critical to\nachieve results from the institution’s investment in training.\nA large bank invests heavily in credit training for lending staff, relying on the trainers alone to\nensure that new skills and techniques are used properly and sustained after training. Management\ncites other priorities and cost as reasons that middle managers are not involved either before,\nduring, or after training. Within months of completing the training initiative, it becomes apparent\nthat the quality of analyses by recent trainees is inconsistent; they seem tentative when making\nand presenting decisions. In the short-term, this situation requires more supervision by middle\nmanagers and a greater investment in time than would have been needed if coaching had been\nconducted during or immediately after training. Over the long-term, the problems discredit senior\nmanagement’s talk about the importance of credit culture and training.\nMoody's Analytics' decades of work with clients to improve risk management skills has empirically shown\nthat coaching is the key to transferring skills from the training environment to the job, and for ensuring that\nskills are sustained. How well prepared are your middle managers to provide this vital function?\n////////// CREDIT-FOCUSED STAFF\nConsider the example of a large bank lacking an institutionally uniform understanding of cash\nflow, while actively engaged in lending to different markets. Some units relied heavily on\nEBITDA measures; others favored a UCA cash flow approach; and still others used net profit plus\ndepreciation. Management was unaware of the inconsistencies in calculating, representing, and\ninterpreting cash flow—until bank examiners became critical of credit risks being assumed because\nof the various metrics used to calculate debt service coverage.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 7Credit-focused staff includes all employees with direct and daily activities involving credit risk: loan officers,\ncredit administrators, credit analysts, underwriters, loan documentation specialists, relationship managers,\ncredit review, collections, and special assets. This category also applies to all types of credits and markets\n(corporate, commercial, consumer, real estate, domestic, and international).\nCredit-focused staff is responsible for:\nEvaluating lending opportunities\nRecommending, structuring, and documenting loans\nMonitoring loans and managing credit relationships\nEnsuring institutional compliance with regulatory requirements\nOverseeing aggregate credit risk at a portfolio level\nCredit-focused employees are the institution’s main line of defense. Their collective actions have by far\nthe greatest influence on institutional credit risk, and thus typically receive the most attention and largest\nallocation of credit-related resources. Yet, as the example illustrates, ensuring that consistent and effective\npractices are being followed is an ongoing challenge.\nThe skills required by this group include questioning and data gathering; credit analysis techniques and loan\nstructuring; evaluating sources of repayment; and forms of support, pricing, documentation, presentation,\nmonitoring, and negotiating. Most employees don’t start out with these skills, and those who do have prior\nexperience often find that their approach is not exactly aligned with the institution’s way of doing business.\nA critical success factor for credit-focused employees is matching their training with the specific skills that\nmust be applied consistently throughout the organization.\nA high-performing regional bank has earned a well-deserved reputation for the quality of its credit\ntraining program. Over decades, this program has generated scores of highly qualified loan officers\nwho have become the core strength of the institution. Alumni of the program are actively recruited\nby rival banks, but most have chosen to remain, citing pride in being affiliated with an institution\nknown as the best at managing credit risk.\nPride and passion for the job are qualities that can elevate a risk management culture to the next\nlevel. When credit-focused staff are appropriately recognized and rewarded for their approach to risk\nmanagement, the result is often excellent institution performance.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 8////////// SALES-FOCUSED STAFF\nA bank that is focused on small and mid-market businesses has a dedicated business development\nstaff whose role is to build new relationships. Typically, the business development officers have\nbeen effective salespeople with little or no credit experience. Customer relationships involving\ncredit often led to tension between the sales team and the credit analysts and underwriters. The\nbank addressed this by requiring all business development officers to participate in a modified\nversion of the credit training given to the lenders.\nSales-focused staff includes all employees with direct and daily activities involving the development of\nnew customer relationships and the expansion of existing relationships: business development officers,\nrelationship managers, account managers, sales support, and customer service staff. Employees in these\nroles may have little or no credit expertise, yet they have a direct influence on credit risk.\nEffective sales and business development activities can actually improve credit risk by driving more\nqualified opportunities into the pipeline and generating a larger pool of credit prospects from which the\ninstitution can then select the best deals. Successful institutions build superior sales-driven organizations\nby viewing both selling and credit risk as everyone’s job.\nRelated to managing credit risk, sales-focused staff is responsible for:\nPursuing qualified prospective borrowers\nIdentifying and presenting new lending opportunities\nEstablishing and building credit customer relationships\nBuilding relationships with qualified borrowers involves asking questions and interpreting information to\ndetermine, at least preliminarily, whether the credit risk is likely to be acceptable to the institution. Many\norganizations have attempted to address this through training in prospecting, selling, and relationship\nmanagement skills.\nBanks that achieve the best results have also required training in basic business acumen, fundamentals of\ncredit analysis, and risk management. These organizations have found that even basic knowledge of credit\namong sales teams yields higher quality prospects, which in turn results in a higher quality loan portfolio\nwith sustainable profitability. These banks also claim that sales teams are more efficient and productive\nwhen they have a better understanding of credit risk.\nA bank's internal employee survey revealed that the loan underwriters felt intimidated by the\npressure put on them by the business development staff. They were afraid to say “no” to many of\nthe loans, even when the level of risk made them uncomfortable.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 9Growth is a challenging driver in competitive markets, and there have been instances of executive priorities\nfalling out of balance. Sales-focused staff can have a profound effect on credit risk, especially when their\ninfluence appears to be endorsed by senior management.\nOne of the most effective ways to balance sales efforts with a strong risk management culture is to train\nsales staff in credit skills.\n////////// OTHER NON-CREDIT UNITS\nThe management of an influential financial institution has applied some outside-the-box\nthinking to its treasury management group by providing training in business acumen and credit\nfundamentals. Treasury management teams apply these skills in collaboration with credit-focused\nstaff to craft relationship solutions that use cash management services to improve business\nborrowers’ cash flow and optimize credit utilization. Management believes that this approach\nstrengthens customer relationships, while enhancing fee income and limiting credit risk.\nOther non-credit units include money market and investment services, retail services, treasury\nmanagement, and trust services. Employees in non-credit functions provide important support for credit\nrelationships and are often a critical source of customer knowledge that may affect credit risk.\nNon-credit units are responsible for:\nProviding non-credit services to customers with credit relationships\nIdentifying credit-related risks and opportunities\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ENSURING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SAFETY ///// 10By developing their business acumen, business lending, and credit skills, employees in non-credit units\nbuild their understanding of business operating cycles and business and consumer cash flow drivers. This\nhelps the units provide better non-credit solutions, and it improves their ability to detect credit risks and\nopportunities.\nA retail services unit of a bank recently noticed several large deposits made by an individual.\nKnowing that the customer and his spouse had loans with the institution, the service employee\nrefrained from attempting to cross-sell deposit or investment opportunities. Instead, the employee\nbrought the information to the attention of the loan officer, believing that it might be relevant\nto the customers’ cash flow and credit risk.
