According to the\nCensus Bureau, after peaking in 2011, college enrollment has\nsince been on a downward trajectory. At the same time,\ncollege tuition has continued to rapidly rise and has more\nthan doubled since the turn of the century, according to the\nNational Center for Education Statistics.\nWhen looking at the younger segment of the labor market,\nthings are a bit different. The gap tends to be about twice as\nlarge, with young workers facing an average unemployment\nrate of around 9.4% compared to about 4.5% for recent\ncollege graduates. Since the Great Financial Crisis, however,\nthe unemployment rate gap between young workers and\nrecent college graduates has narrowed meaningfully, from\nabout 9.1 percentage points in 2009 at the peak of the crisis\nOur previous work has highlighted the ways in which the\nto a low of just 1.7 percentage points in April of this year. This\nfinancial burden of a college education has increased in the\nis less than half the average gap and is only slightly higher\npast decade. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that\nthan the gap between all workers and college-educated\nrecent crops of college graduates are feeling disillusioned\nworkers during that same period.\nwith the labor market and find it increasingly challenging to\nfind a job upon graduation. This raises the question: On the\nwhole, is there still an economic advantage to a college\neducation?\nThe short answer is yes, but emerging trends have altered\nthis advantage, and perhaps not for the reasons that some\nmight assume. According to data compiled by the New York\nFed, college graduates have a lower likelihood of\nunemployment compared to the average worker. The\nunemployment rate for college-educated workers typically\nranges between 2% and 3% while the average\nunemployment rate across all demographics tends to bounce\nbetween 3% and 6%. The gap has narrowed in the years\nsince the Great Financial Crisis, but the advantage of a\ncollege degree nonetheless remains.\nBut the story is not one of precipitously falling opportunities\nfor college graduates. Rather, it seems that the opportunities\nfor young workers in general have become more abundant in\nrecent years. In the last two years, the unemployment rate\nfor young workers has been more than one standard\ndeviation below its historic average for 10 months. A similar\ndynamic has been at play in the broader labor force; the total\nunemployment rate has also been more than one standard\ndeviation below its mean for 20 of the last 24 months.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH / WEEKLY MARKET OUTLOOK 3However, no such patterns can be seen among college 40% of recent graduates were underemployed as of\ngraduates of any age whose unemployment rates have September, but this is historically normal.\nremained around their historic averages.\nThe particularly abnormal conditions of the labor market in\nthe last few years can explain some of the sliding advantages\nthat college graduates have over non-college-educated\nworkers in the labor market. Data from the Atlanta Fed Wage\nTracker show that wage growth during the past few years has\nbeen strong for all education levels, but those with only a\nhigh school degree have seen the largest gains, which is\nhistorically atypical. Low-skill occupations have also seen\nhigher wage growth than high-skilled occupations over the\npast few years—yet another anomaly.\nThis unusual pattern can be partially explained by tightness in\nthe labor market, which has kept upward pressure on wages, Additionally, despite not netting the biggest gains in recent\nparticularly in lower-skilled industries.

Excess demand for workers within these\nindustries increases wage pressures and boosts earnings.\nFurther, quits rates in these industries tend to be higher and\nthose who leave jobs tend to see a wage hike premium over\nthose who stay. Because college graduates usually do not\nfind themselves in industries that tend to be less transient,\nthe gap is closing from the bottom, not the top.\nUnderemployment, in this case defined as a situation in\nwhich those with college degrees work jobs that do not\nrequire a college degree, reinforces this idea.
