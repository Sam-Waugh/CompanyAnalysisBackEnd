Congress and the Biden administration\nhave no more than a month before the Treasury runs out of enough cash to pay all of the\ngovernment’s bills on time. Here, we update our analysis of two alternative scenarios that bookend\nthe economic impact if lawmakers do not act in time and there is a breach of the limit.1 The first envisages\nthat lawmakers reverse themselves within a week of a breach as turmoil in financial markets quickly\nconvinces them to increase the limit. And the second envisages a prolonged breach. We also assess the\nimpact of these scenarios on state economies.\nX-date update\nThe 2023 tax filing season has come and gone, and it is now clear that Congress and the Biden administra-\ntion have even less time to hammer out a deal to raise or suspend the debt limit than previously thought.\nWe estimate that the X-date, when the Treasury will run out of the cash needed to pay the government’s\nbills on time, will fall on June 8 (see Chart 1). This is consistent with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s “best\nestimate” that Treasury will be unable to fulfill all of the federal government’s obligations by early June. The\nCongressional Budget Office similarly warned that there is a “significantly greater risk” of the X-date falling\nin early June.\nCumulative non-withheld income tax receipts since the beginning of April are tracking nearly 40% below their\nyear-ago performance (see Chart 2). The Treasury’s tax haul has been considerably smaller than we had antici-\npated just a month ago. In early April, our X-date estimate assumed that by the end of the month the Treasury\nwould have close to $500 billion in cash-on-hand and so-called extraordinary measures, or accounting tools\nthat limit the amount of debt subject to the statutory limit. However, the sum of the Treasury’s cash balance\nand extraordinary measures was not much more than $350 billion. The postponement of the tax filing dead-\nline until October 16 for disaster-area taxpayers in California, Alabama and Georgia and smaller capital gains\ntax receipts are the likely culprits behind the unexpected weakness in April tax revenue.\nOur estimate of the X-date is uncertain given the difficulty forecasting tax revenues. Applying the average\nabsolute forecast errors of key deposits and withdrawals from the Treasury’s primary operational account at\nthe Federal Reserve as calculated by the CBO, the X-date could come as soon as June 1 and as late as early\nAugust. Critical to estimating precisely when is the assumption that the IRS will finish processing this year’s\n1 Our baseline—the most likely—scenario is that the debt limit drama will go down to the final hour, but that lawmakers come to terms before\nthere is a breach. This is a so-called clean debt limit increase, although lawmakers also agree to some cuts to future government spending and\nother modest changes to fiscal policy as part of the fiscal 2024 budget necessary to fund the government and avoid a government shutdown.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 2Chart 1: June 8 Is the Most Likely X-Date…\nCash balance and available extraordinary measures, $ bil\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n-200\n-300\n-400\n5/1/23 5/8/23 5/15/23 5/22/23 5/29/23 6/5/23 6/12/23 6/19/23 6/26/23 7/3/23 7/10/23 7/17/23 7/24/23 7/31/23 8/7/23\nRange of outcomes based on CBO's avg absolute forecast errors Base case scenario\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 1\nChart 2: …As Tax Receipts Have Been Weaker Than Anticipated\nNon-withheld individual income tax receipts, $ bil, moto date\n700\n600\n500\n-38%\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n4/3 4/5 4/7 4/9 4/11 4/13 4/15 4/17 4/19 4/21 4/23 4/25 4/27 4/29 5/1 5/3 5/5 5/7 5/9 5/11 5/13 5/15\n2023 2022\nSources: U.S. Treasury, Moody’s Analytics\n2\ntax returns more quickly than it did a year ago when it was hampered by the pandemic. The IRS will thus\nprocess fewer extra payments this month than it did last year. This is consistent with non-withheld income\ntax receipts so far in May.\nIt is also important to note that the X-date may be June 8 as we forecast, but a few days later the Treasury\nwill benefit from a mid-June surge of quarterly payments of non-withheld taxes owed by higher-income\ntaxpayers. As a result, the Treasury could muddle through the remainder of June, paying the government’s\nbills on time. This could reduce the immediate pressure on lawmakers to act, although that will likely\ndepend on how financial markets react.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 3Financial system fault lines\nGlobal investors are already on edge. This is evident in the recent surge in yields on one-month Treasury\nbills, which now mature on the other side of the estimated early June X-date (see Chart 3). It seems incom-\nprehensible that the Treasury would not prioritize Treasury debt payments. It can do so because those\npayments are made via Fedwire, a system separate from that used to pay the government’s other bills. Not\npaying on the debt would cause immediate financial market chaos resulting forever in higher government\nborrowing costs. Yet investors are not absolutely sure of timely payment and are thus demanding a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk.\nChart 3: Fault Lines Develop in the Financial System…\n1-mo Treasury yields, constant maturity, %\n6.0\n5.5 May 5, 2023\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\nJan Feb Mar\nSources: ICE, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 3\nCredit default swaps on Treasury securities—the cost of buying insurance in case Treasury defaults on the\ndebt—have also jumped in recent weeks (see Chart 4). At near 130 basis points, the CDS spread on one-\nyear Treasury securities is already substantially more than in 2011 when that debt limit drama was so\nunnerving it caused rating agency Standard & Poor’s to strip the U.S. of its AAA rating.2 While stock prices\nfell almost 20% intraday during the 2011 debt limit battle, they have held up well so far in the current tus-\nsle. But this is likely to change soon as the X-date comes into clear view. Indeed, it may well require a selloff\nin stocks, bonds, and the value of the U.S. dollar to generate the political will necessary to force lawmakers\nto come to terms. It is only when donors and constituents, angry at their evaporating wealth, pound on\nlawmakers’ doors, that lawmakers will act.\nShort Breach scenario\nHowever, odds are increasing that lawmakers will not act before the debt limit is breached. We consider\nwhat this means for the national and state economies under the alternative scenario in which it is a short\nbreach of no more than a week.\n2 A CDS spread of 100 basis points means that it costs $100 to insure $10,000 worth of Treasury securities against a default on those securities.\nThe surge in CDS spreads may overstate investors’ angst since the CDS market for buying insurance in the case of a Treasury default is not actively\ntraded and it does not take much trading to push up the cost of insurance, but it should not be dismissed out of hand.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 4Chart 4:…That Threaten to Become Earthquakes\nU.S. Treasury credit default swap spread by tenor, bps\n140\nGreat Financial Crisis Debt limit standoffs\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n1-yr 3-yr\nThe CDS spread on U.S. Treasury securities measures the cost of purchasing insurance to protect against a default\nSources: ICE, Moody’s Analytics on that Treasury. For example, a 100-basis point spread means it costs $100 to insure $10,000 worth of Treasuries.\nMoody’s Analytics 4\nMost immediately, financial markets will be roiled. A TARP moment seems likely. This hearkens to the dark\nday in autumn 2008 when Congress initially failed to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout of the\nbanking system, and the stock market and other financial markets cratered. A similar crisis, characterized by\nspiking interest rates and plunging equity prices, would be ignited. Short-term funding markets, essential to\nthe flow of credit that helps finance the economy’s day-to-day activities, likely would freeze up as well. It\nwas a matter of days before Congress reversed itself and voted for TARP, which is about the amount of time\nwe assume is needed to convince this Congress to reverse itself and vote for a debt limit increase.\nIt is difficult to fathom that lawmakers would allow things to get to this point, but as the TARP experience\nhighlights, it cannot be dismissed. Still, if that harrowing experience is a guide, lawmakers would quickly\nreverse course and resolve the debt limit impasse to allow the Treasury to resume issuing debt again and\npay its bills.\nIt is unclear whether the credit rating agencies would downgrade Treasury debt in this scenario. According\nto Moody’s Investors Service, it would downgrade if the Treasury failed to make a bond payment. But,\naccording to the rating agency, if the episode was short-lived and cured with full recovery, the ratings impact\n“would likely be limited, with the sovereign rating likely remaining close to Aaa, consistent with the U.S.’ very\nhigh capacity to repay debt and supported by a number of key considerations including very strong economic\nand institutional credit features.”3 However, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the nation’s debt in the 2011\ndebt limit battle for much less, citing the political dysfunction at the time. Since then, that dysfunction has\nonly intensified.\nA downgrade of Treasury debt would set off a cascade of credit implications and downgrades on the debt of\nmany other financial institutions, nonfinancial corporations, municipalities, infrastructure providers, struc-\ntured finance transactions, and other debt issuers. Those institutions that are clearly backstopped by the\nU.S. government, institutions such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, would\n3 Additional documentation from Moody’s Investors Service is available upon request.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 5suffer the biggest changes to their ratings. The effects on other institutions’ ratings would vary depending\non their relationship with the U.S. government and offsetting financial strengths.\nDespite lawmakers’ quick reversal in this scenario and our assumption that the rating agencies do not engage\nin downgrades, considerable damage will have already been done. The timing could not be worse for the econ-\nomy; even without the specter of a debt limit breach many CEOs and economists believe a recession is dead\nahead. With the Federal Reserve ramping up interest rates to quell wage and price pressures, avoiding a reces-\nsion would be difficult even if nothing else went wrong. Most leading indicators of recession, including the\nprescient Treasury yield curve—the difference between long- and short-term Treasury yields—strongly point to\nrecession beginning later this year, about when lawmakers will be battling over the limit.\nAlthough the debt limit breach is short, it is enough to undermine the already-fragile U.S. economy, which\nsuffers a mild recession in the second half of this year. Real GDP declines by 0.7 percentage point peak to\ntrough, employment declines by 1.5 million jobs, and the unemployment rate rises from 3.4% to a peak\nof almost 5% (see Chart 5). Financial markets sell off but settle as investors take solace in lawmakers’\ndecision to quickly reverse course. There is little long-term fallout on the economy, although global inves-\ntors demand several basis points more in interest on Treasury debt to compensate for the meaningful risk\nthat lawmakers may breach the debt limit again in the future. Of course, even a few basis points more on\ntrillions in Treasury debt adds up to a significant cost to taxpayers. If Treasury securities are no longer per-\nceived as risk-free by global investors, future generations of Americans would pay a steep economic price.\nChart 5: Unemployment Under Different Debt Limit Scenarios\nUnemployment rate, %\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33\nClean Debt Limit Short Breach Prolonged Breach\nSources: FHFA, Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 5\nProlonged Breach scenario\nIn this much darker alternative scenario, lawmakers breach the debt limit and trigger a TARP moment but\nthen fail to reverse course quickly. Instead, the political impasse drags on for weeks through much of the\nsummer with the Treasury prioritizing debt payments over other bills. We assume in these circumstances\nthat the credit rating agencies would downgrade Treasury debt, precipitating widespread downgrades\nthroughout the financial system.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 6The blow to the economy would be cataclysmic. The federal government would have no option but to slash\nits outlays, since outlays could be no greater than revenues the Treasury collects. Assuming a June 8 debt\nlimit breach that dragged on through July, the Treasury would have no choice but to eliminate a cumulative\ncash deficit of approximately $150 billion by slashing government spending. As these cuts work through the\neconomy, the hit to growth would be overwhelming.\nAdding to the economic turmoil would be the damage to consumer, business and investor confidence.\nPolitical brinkmanship over the operations of the federal government has been frightening for Americans\nto watch. In both the 2011 and 2013 debt limit episodes, households were closely attuned to the political\nhardball being played in Washington, and consumer sentiment slumped. The brinkmanship is also unnerv-\ning for businesses that will curtail investment and hiring, and for financial institutions that will quickly turn\nmore cautious in extending credit to households and businesses.\nIt is difficult to envisage what steps policymakers could take to mitigate the economic carnage. With law-\nmakers at loggerheads over the debt limit, it is unlikely they would agree on any fiscal support for the econ-\nomy in response to the self-inflicted crisis, at least not quickly. The Federal Reserve would immediately cut\nshort-term rates to near the zero lower bound and ramp up quantitative easing—Fed purchases of Treasury\nbonds—but any benefit would be undermined as global investors sold or stopped buying U.S. securities.4\nThe economic downturn that would ensue would be comparable to that suffered during the global financial\ncrisis. That means real GDP would decline during the second half of this year and into 2024, falling 4.6%\npeak to trough, costing the economy more than 7.8 million jobs, and pushing the unemployment rate to\n8%. Stock prices would fall by almost a fifth at the worst of the selloff, wiping out $10 trillion in household\nwealth. Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and other consumer and corporate borrowing rates would spike\nuntil the debt limit is resolved. They would decline during the subsequent deep recession, but ultimately\nremain elevated as investors demand compensation for the risk of a future breach (see Chart 6). The econ-\nomy’s long-term growth prospects are also weakened. A decade from now, real GDP is almost 1 percentage\npoint lower, there are 1.2 million fewer jobs, and the full-employment, or structural, unemployment rate is\nclose to 0.2 percentage point higher.\nThe broad trade-weighted value of the U.S. dollar increases in the immediate wake of the breach as global\ninvestors are unsure of alternative global safe havens to the dollar. However, this does not last long, and\nthe dollar soon begins to decline in value as its status as the global reserve currency is diminished. A decade\nfrom now, the broad trade-weighted dollar is worth about 5% less.\nRegional economic fallout\nMost state economies will be hit hard if there is a debt limit breach, although the economic pain varies.\nA breach most immediately impacts regions with a large federal government presence. Washington DC,\nwhere the federal government accounts for approximately one in four jobs, more than four times the share\nin the next-highest state, is the poster child (see Tables 1 and 2). With many of those jobs jeopardized by a\nbreach, the nation’s capital is easily the most immediately vulnerable economy. It is followed by states that\nare either located nearby or lean heavily on federal installations such as national laboratories or military\n4 Federal Reserve policy in the scenarios is determined endogenously with the Moody’s Analytics macroeconomic model. The federal funds rate\nequation in the model is a reaction function, which accounts for the Fed’s dual mandate of low and stable inflation and full employment. It also\ncaptures financial conditions, which impact the transmission of Fed policy to the economy, and global economic conditions.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 7Chart 6: 10-Year Treasury Yield Under Different Debt Limit Scenarios\n10-yr Treasury yield, %\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33\nClean Debt Limit Payment prioritization Prolonged Breach\nSources: FHFA, Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 6\nbases, including Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico. While the public sector typically serves as a stabilizing\nforce, in the case of a breach it supercharges its economic fallout.\nRegional economies that are heavily reliant on federal outlays are also impacted more significantly by a\ndebt limit breach. Professional services firms suffer, hurting white-collar support firms in and around the\nBeltway, particularly Northern Virginia. Aerospace is also hurt, impacting states including Connecticut,\nKansas and Washington.\nDisruptions to Medicare and Medicaid payments are a problem for the healthcare industry and most signifi-\ncantly smaller hospitals and doctors’ offices with little financial wiggle room, especially in rural areas. Lon-\nger term, healthcare providers would likely be more hesitant to see Medicare and Medicaid patients. Other\ngovernment transfers to households, including Social Security and unemployment insurance benefits, are\nalso impacted. As these payments are delayed, spending and confidence weaken, especially in areas with a\nlarger number of lower-income households or a larger retiree population.\nIt takes somewhat longer for the economic fallout from the selloff in stock and bond markets to make itself\nfelt. But once it does, wealthy states and retiree havens are most in the crosshairs given their economies’\nreliance on capital gains, dividends, interest and rent. Although all regions are hurt, the Northeast bears a\nparticularly heavy burden in this respect.\nRegional economies more sensitive to the ups and downs in the business cycle are also disproportionately\nimpacted by a debt limit breach. Tourist- and business travel-dependent states such as Arizona, Florida and\nNevada will experience sharp job losses; so do the vehicle industry-dependent Michigan and South Carolina\neconomies as vehicle sales and production fall. Other manufacturing centers like Tennessee and Kentucky\nface challenges as firms struggle to raise capital and remain afloat given softness in financial markets\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 8Conclusions\nGlobal investors and Americans more generally appear largely unruffled by the fast-approaching X-date, at\nleast so far. There are some indications that investors are taking notice, but the stock market remains firm\nas does much of the bond market and the value of the U.S. dollar. This blasé attitude toward the debt limit\nlikely stems from the notion that we have seen this movie many times over the decades and know the end-\ning well. That is, there will be lots of political drama right up to the X-date and at the 11th hour lawmakers\nwill pass legislation avoiding a breach. But the longer it takes for financial markets to react, the greater the\nodds that lawmakers will not act in time, since market turmoil is probably what it will take to generate the\npolitical will lawmakers will need to come to terms.\nIt is thus increasingly important to consider the possibility that lawmakers fail to act in time and there is a\nbreach of the debt limit. We now assign a 10% probability to a breach. If there is a breach, it is much more\nlikely to be a short one than a prolonged one. But even a lengthy standoff no longer has a zero probability.\nWhat once seemed unimaginable now seems a real threat.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit Scenario UpDate 9Table 1: Employment Under Treasury
