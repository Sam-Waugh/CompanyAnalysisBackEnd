They must be able to identify the\nowner's needs, analyze both business and\npersonal cash flow and debt, and assess credit\nand repayment risks.\nDeveloping these skills can have a significant\npayoff. Financial institutions that take a targeted\napproach to the small business lending market\nhave an opportunity to build the type of trusted\nrelationships that can result in increased revenues\nand profitability.\nSMALL BUSINESSES, BIG PAYOFFS | 3CHAPTER 1: What Makes Small Business\nLending Attractive?\nThere are big growth and profit opportunities in lending small\nEven though small business lending requires Profitability To ensure\nspecialized knowledge, there are serveral\nFor small businesses, obtaining the funding profitability in\nreasons that it can be an attractive market for\nthey need is a top priority.

Support\nLending to Small Businesses Presents Continued Growth Opportunities\nSmall businesses throughout the U.S. are underserved by financial institutions, with many not receiving the credit they need. This\npresents an opportunity for financial institutions to expand their small business lending programs. But small businesses have different\nborrowing needs, and lenders with experience in consumer or commercial lending often lack the specific skills needed for small\nbusiness lending success.\nThe key is to approach small business lending holistically and as a means of deepening customer relationships. Because small\nbusinesses are typically owned by a single individual or a small group of individuals, a small business lending relationship has the\npotential to increase the borrowers’ overall relationship with the institution with deposits, personal loans, owner investments, and cash\nmanagement. While the small business loan itself may not be highly profitable, the bundling of other products and services can turn a\nsmall business borrower into a profitable and attractive relationship.\nThe most successful small business lenders can connect and communicate with business owners, understand the unique requirements\nof small businesses, ask the right questions, and then apply their knowledge and understanding to tailor customized solutions to the\nindividual business. Financial institutions that invest in their lenders and provide them with training in these skills will be the most\nsuccessful in small business lending both today and into the future.\nSMALL BUSINESSES, BIG PAYOFFS | 10THE MOODY'S ANALYTICS\nDIFFERENCE\nWe understand that your business operates in a highly competitive\nmarketplace where the skill level of your associates correlates\ndirectly with enterprise success.
