NSFR regulation requires that an institution’s available stable funding (ASF) sourced\nContact Us\nfrom a bank’s capital and liabilities is at least equal to the required stable funding (RSF) for the\nbank’s assets over a one year time horizon. To satisfy this requirement, firms must take into\nAmericas +1.212.553.1653\naccount the liquidity and maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. NSFR covers the\nclientservices@moodys.com\nfunding risk across both on- and off-balance sheet (OBS) assets. To mitigate short-term funding\nEurope +44.20.7772.5454\nmismatches, it also provides an incentive for institutions to fund these assets from more stable,\nclientservices.emea@moodys.com\nlong-term sources rather than short-term wholesale funding.\nAsia-Pacific +85.2.2916.1121\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com\nNSFR was first introduced2 in 2009, and was included in the Basel III guidelines3 published in\nJapan +81.3.5408.4100 December 2010 as a complement to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) short-term liquidity\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com\nmeasure. The Committee then underwent a rigorous process of reviewing the standard and its\nimplications on the functioning of the financial markets and the economy, concluding with a\nconsultative document4 on NSFR in January 2014. This consultation, while largely aligning itself\nwith the LCR guidelines, altered the calibration of the NSFR to be more stringent on short term,\npotentially volatile funding sources, and reduced potential cliff effects in the measurements of ASF\nand RSF.\nThe final standard becomes effective on January 1, 2018. Grounded in the 2014 consultative\ndocument, it changes the treatment of short-term exposures to banks and other financial\ninstitutions, and the treatment of derivative exposures. It also allows the exclusion, upon meeting\nspecific conditions, of interdependent assets and liabilities. A summary of the changes between\nthe 2014 consultative document and final standard is available in Appendix A.\n1 Final standard on NSFR (link)\n2 Consultative document on International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring (link)\n3 Basel III guidelines published in December 2010 (link)\n4 Consultative document on NSFR (link)MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nCONTeNTS\n1.

Overview of Scope and Timeline\n» NSFR is required to be used for all internationally active banks on a consolidated basis.\n» To ensure greater consistency and a level playing field between domestic and cross-border banks, NSFR\ncan also be used, but is not required, for other banks and entities of internationally active banks.\n» The Committee recommended that banks monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding needs\nat the level of individual legal entities, foreign branches and subsidiaries, taking into account the legal,\nregulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquidity.\n» NSFR will become effective on January 1, 2018 and must be reported at least quarterly.\n2. Definition\n» NSFR is the ratio of the available amount of stable funding to the required amount of stable funding\nover the time horizon of one year. The NSFR regulation requires the ratio to be greater than or equal to\n100 percent on an ongoing basis.\nAvailable amount of stable funding\nNSFR = ≥ 100%\nRequired amount of stable funding\nwhere,\n» Available amount of stable funding is a portion of institution’s capital and liabilities expected to be\nreliable over the next one year.\n» Required amount of stable funding is the funding required depending upon the liquidity characteristics\nand residual maturities of an institution’s assets and OBS exposures over the next one year.\n3 May 2015 Net Stable FuNdiNg RatioMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n3.

Off-Balance Sheet exposures\n» OBS exposures, such as the undrawn portion of credit and liquidity facilities, guarantees, letters of\ncredit, trade finance obligations, and non-contractual obligations, can lead to significant funding\nrequirements over a time horizon of one year. As a result, the Committee requires institutions to assign\nRSF factors to OBS exposures and take the OBS exposures into account in the NSFR calculation.\n» Consistent with the final Basel standard on LCR, the NSFR identifies OBS exposure categories based\nbroadly on whether the commitment is a credit or liquidity facility or some other contingent funding\nobligation. An RSF factor of 5% is assigned to the undrawn portions of irrevocable and conditionally\nrevocable credit and liquidity facilities. National supervisors can specify the RSF factors for other\ncontingent funding obligations, including unconditionally revocable credit and liquidity facilities,\nguarantees and letters of credit, trade finance obligations, and non-contractual obligations, based on\ntheir national circumstances.\n11 Level 2A assets for the purpose of calculating NSFR would be as defined in paragraph 52 of the final Basel standard on LCR\n12 Level 1 assets for the purpose of calculating NSFR would be as defined in paragraph 50 of the final Basel standard on LCR\n6 May 2015 Net Stable FuNdiNg RatioMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nAppendix A: Summary of Primary Changes Between the 2014 Consultation\nand the Final Standard\nFINAL STANDARD, OCTOBER 2014 CONSULTATION, JANUARY 2014\nderivative assets and » Final framework specifies the calculation of derivative » Did not specify the calculation of derivative asset and\nliabilities asset and liability amounts for treatment of derivative liability amounts\nexposures for NSFR calculation\n» Net derivative liabilities (assets) received a 0% ASF\n» Net derivative liabilities (assets) receive a 0% ASF (100% (100% RSF) factor\nRSF) factor.
