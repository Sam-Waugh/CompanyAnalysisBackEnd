Introduction\nIssues of spread forecasting and trading on views about relative value are of primary interest to many bond market practitioners.\nWe provide new evidence on the strength and nature of dynamic relationships between credit risk metrics and bond spreads, as\nwell as on relative value and the cross-section of bond returns in US investment-grade and US high-yield markets. Our use of daily,\nbond-level data in the first task is novel, as is our use of a model-driven downgrade risk probability metric in examining both\ndynamics and the cross-section of bond returns. While default risk has received more attention in the past, a formal investigation\nof the role ex-ante downgrade risk plays in forecasting spread movements and determining relative value appears lacking. As it\nturns out, both downgrade and high-quality default risk metrics prove to be important in both contexts.\nBefore reviewing our findings in more detail, a brief review of work that uses credit risk to explain and predict bond spreads is in\norder. The general consensus in the literature is that default and downgrade risks help explain bond spreads in the cross section,\nalthough the extent to which this is the case remains a subject of active research.\nThe academic focus has mostly centered on the ability of structural credit risk model spreads to explain observed bond spreads\nwhen calibrated to observed default frequencies. A widely cited paper by Huang and Huang (2003), for example, presents\nevidence indicating that credit risk accounts for only a small fraction of yield spread of US investment-grade (USIG) bonds, but a\nmuch higher fraction of spreads for US high-yield (USHY) bonds. Recent work by Huang, Nozawa, and Shi (2019) extends these\nfindings to global corporate bond data, finding that standard benchmark structural credit risk models fail to explain the cross-\ncountry variation in spreads as well as their dynamic behavior. Crucially, such findings are based on the practice of calibrating the\nparameters of a selection of structural credit risk models from the literature to be consistent with average historical default\nfrequencies, recovery rates, leverage ratios, and equity premium estimates by broad rating category.\nAs shown by Chen, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2008), however, the associated “credit spread puzzle” in investment-grade\nbond markets can be resolved by accounting for the strong covariation between default rates and Sharpe ratios, which both spike\nin recessions. Their model is able to closely match both the level and time variation of US Baa-Aaa corporate bond spreads, and\nachieves a high model versus actual correlation in levels of 72% over the 1919-2004 period. Recent research by Feldhütter and\nSchaefer (2018) on “The Myth of the Credit Spread Puzzle” applies a new approach for calibrating a standard structural model to\naverage historical default rates. They too find that their model matches the level of investment grade spreads well, while\nsurprisingly underestimating spreads on high-yield debt. Bai, Goldstein, and Yang (2019) question aspects of the calibration use to\nobtain the latter finding, and recover evidence for a credit spread puzzle in investment-grade corporate bonds, but not high yield.\nThey also point out that a credit spread puzzle is consistent with models that allow for priced jump risk in firm asset values and/or\nwhich allow for clustering of defaults in bad states, as in Chen, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2008).1\nThe overall consensus to date is that structural models calibrated to observed default frequencies do a poorer job of matching\nspread levels and variation in investment grade corporate bond markets compared to high yield, although with appropriate\nmodifications, are able to match a non-trivial portion of spread levels in both markets.\nPerhaps because of lingering doubt in the academic literature about the strength of the connection between default probabilities\nand spreads, less attention seems to have been paid to issues of spread forecasting, and of the economic value of relative value\nstrategies driven by measures of credit risk. Exceptions to this rule include articles by Krishnan, Ritchken, and Thomson (2010) on\nspread prediction and Berndt, Douglas, Duffie, and Ferguson (2018) on the relation of credit risk premia to default risk, as well as\nrecent papers by Israel, Palhares, and Richardson (2018) and Bai, Bali, and Wen (2019) on risk factors in the cross-section of\ncorporate bond returns. One of the earliest examples of work by Moody’s Analytics researchers on the performance of relative\nvalue strategies in fixed income is the article by Li, Zhang, and Crossen’s (2012) in the Journal of Fixed Income. We provide novel\nstylized facts related to the surprisingly robust dynamic connection between high-quality credit risk metrics and bond spreads,\nincluding in the investment grade market. In addition, we document the success in USIG and USHY of a class of relative value\nstrategies based on misalignment of spreads with measured levels of default and downgrade risk.\nIn our exercises, we combine data from Moody’s Analytics CreditEdge™ model—in particular model-driven measures of default\nand rating downgrade probabilities—with data on bond total returns, option-adjusted spreads, duration, and other metrics from\n1 Other papers that pursue closely related ideas include Almeida and Philippon (2007); Bhamra, Kuehn, and Strebulaev (2009); and Berndt, Ritchken, and Sun\n(2010).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 3Refinitiv and issuer rating data from Moody’s Investors Service. We examine bond data at both the monthly and daily frequencies,\nas well as aggregate and bond-level granularity, to “turn on the microscope” and uncover relationships that might otherwise be\nelusive. Specifically, the three leading CreditEdge metrics that we use in this study include the EDF™ (Expected Default\nFrequency), the Deterioration Probability (DP), and the Fair Value Spread (FVS). The EDF and DP provide daily frequency estimates\nof one-year horizon physical default and downgrade probabilities, respectively. The EDF is the output of our structural credit risk\nmodel, as documented in Nazeran and Dwyer (2015), and the DP is the output of a reduced form statistical model documented in\nMalone, Baron, and White (2018). The FVS, a model-driven fair value spread estimate that takes the duration-matched EDF of a\nbond as an input, is a daily frequency output calculated using information on default risk, the distribution of bond spreads, and\nother parameters such as amount outstanding as a proxy for bond liquidity. Documentation of how this metric is constructed can\nbe found in Dwyer et al. (2010).\nBased on these metrics, we uncover and update a number of useful stylized facts for those who trade bonds and manage fixed-\nincome portfolios. The main empirical results are as follows.\nFirst, we find that the high average cross-sectional correlations between market spreads and Fair Value Spreads over our sample, of\n0.72 in USIG and 0.58 in USHY, are clearly at odds with the classic credit spread puzzle findings, as is the fact that the cross-\nsectional correlation is meaningfully higher in USIG than USHY, in line with the results of Feldhütter and Schaefer (2018). Time\nseries correlations between mean market spreads and mean EDFs are higher still: 0.86 in USIG and 0.89 in USHY.\nSecond, we uncover robust evidence of statistically significant Granger causality between credit risk metrics and corporate bond\nspreads. This conclusion holds at the aggregate level, for mean default and downgrade probabilities and mean spreads, as well as\nat the level of daily individual bond spreads and daily issuer-specific default and downgrade metrics. In fact, based on the 5% level\nof significance, in daily data for the USIG market from January 2007 to April 2020, the EDF Granger-causes spreads for 68% of\nindividual bonds. The DP Granger-causes spreads for 50% of bonds in USIG. In the USHY market, these figures are 58% and 52%,\nrespectively, for the default and downgrade probability metrics.\nThird, in light of robust evidence of Granger-causal linkages between credit risk and bond spreads at the aggregate and individual\nbond levels, we estimate structural VAR (SVAR) models for aggregate mean EDFs, DPs, the market Sharpe ratio (MSR), and\nobserved aggregate market spreads in USIG and USHY. The ordering of the variables in the model for identification is as indicated.\nThis allows us to take into account the contemporaneous correlation of credit risk variables with bond spreads when estimating\nimpulse-responses of spreads.\nImpulse-response analysis based on our structural VAR models indicates that, while shocks to aggregate default and downgrade\nrisk appear to be priced into aggregate bond spreads immediately at the monthly frequency, the effect of aggregate credit risk\nshocks flows into aggregate spreads gradually over the course of 10-20 trading days in daily data. The effects are statistically\nsignificant at conventional levels. The non-cumulative effects of a one-standard deviation shock to risk metrics at the 20 trading\nday mark are as follows: for the EDF metric, 5 bps in USIG and 15 bps in USHY, and for the DP metric, 1 bp in USIG and 4 bps in\nUSHY. For a bond with a duration of 8 years and bond-market beta of 1.0, the annualized monthly returns implied by these spread\nchange magnitudes lie in a wide range, from 1% to 14.4%. Except for the case of DP shocks in the USIG market, the other\nmagnitudes likely exceed typical estimates of transaction costs in the respective bond markets.\nIn terms of the size of contemporaneous responses of aggregate monthly spreads to one-standard deviation shocks to the other\nvariables in the SVAR, we obtain 19 bps for the EDF, 13 bps for the DP, and 18 bps for the MSR in USIG. In USHY, the figures are 80\nbps for the EDF, 12 bps for the DP, and 39 bps for the MSR. These magnitudes should be compared to the monthly standard\ndeviations of the mean aggregate OAS time series for USIG and USHY, which are 89 bps and 291 bps, respectively. By that\nmeasure, a one standard deviation shock to the aggregate EDF residual explains 21.3% of the subsequent month aggregate OAS\nstandard deviation in USIG and 27.5% of the subsequent month OAS standard deviation in USHY. While downgrade risk is\nrelatively more important in IG than in HY, as expected, the impact of shocks to default risk on aggregate spreads is greater than\nfor downgrade risk in both markets.\nThese findings are somewhat related to the results of Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin (2001), who investigate the\ndeterminants of credit spread changes. They find that variables that should in theory determine credit spread changes—including\nchanges in the firm leverage ratio, the 10-year Treasury yield, the Treasury yield curve slope, the volatility index (VIX), and the\nslope of the volatility smirk, plus S&P500 returns—actually have rather limited explanatory power. Further, individual monthly\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 4bond regression residuals are mostly driven by a common, unobserved factor. They conclude from this that monthly credit spread\nchanges are principally driven by local supply/demand shocks that are independent of both credit risk factors and standard proxies\nfor liquidity. In light of our results from Granger-causality tests and SVAR models, it appears that more accurate measures of\ndefault and downgrade risk do explain a non-trivial fraction of the subsequent time series variation of aggregate spreads, and\nGranger-cause most bond spreads at the individual level.\nThe above results are encouraging, but may understate the magnitude of credit risk effects on spread changes at high risk levels, as\nthey pertain only to effects on conditional mean spreads. In fact, at the individual bond level in daily data, when we examine\nspread behavior around high credit risk thresholds, we find effects that are significantly larger in both USIG and USHY markets.\nExceedance of EDF thresholds in the 80-98th percentile range in USIG is associated with a rise in spreads of 13-30 bps,\nrespectively, over the next 20 trading days, for example, and a rise in spreads of 33-182 bps over the same period in USHY. For the\nDP, the rise in spreads over 20 trading days equates to 6-15 bps in USIG and 24-93 bps in USHY for exceedance of DP thresholds\nin the 80-98th percentile range.\nAcross bonds, average monthly OAS time series standard deviations are 60 bps in USIG and 242 bps in USHY.2 Thus, spread\nchanges following high EDF exceedances translate into 20-50% of the average monthly OAS standard deviation in USIG and 14-\n75% of the monthly spread standard deviation in USHY. The equivalent percentages for the DP are 10-25% in USIG and 10-38%\nin USHY. These magnitudes are highly material in both fixed-income markets, and as expected, larger in USHY. At the individual\nbond level, exceeding high levels of default and downgrade risk translates into large increases in spreads over the next month. This\nfinding is clearly at odds with the spirit of the credit spread puzzle, which states that structural credit risk models fail to explain\nmuch variation in contemporaneous spreads, much less predict their movements.\nThese sorts of stylized facts are potentially useful for tactical trading decisions, but leave open the question of portfolio-level\nstrategies, in particular relative to index benchmarks. A natural connection arises from looking at relative value in the index cross-\nsection. To that end, we estimate a series of affine fair value spread models in monthly cross-sections of bonds using two different\ninformation sets. A “Basic quant” information set includes the duration, Moody’s Investors Service issuer rating, and sector of a\nbond’s issuer. The “CreditEdge quant” information sets include the various non-empty subsets of the one-year default probability\nmetric (the EDF), the one-year probability of a rating downgrade (the DP), and the Fair Value Spread (FVS) of the bond produced\nby the CreditEdge bond model. Finally, we look at “Combined quant” information sets that take the union of the two information\nsets just described.\nFor each market and month, we use the residuals from cross-sectional linear pricing models for the bond option-adjusted spread\n(OAS to form quintile portfolios, after duration bucketing. We find that the mean returns by residual quintile portfolio decrease\nmonotonically in both USIG and USHY markets for all statistical arbitrage strategies. Further, we find that using CreditEdge quant\nmetrics alone as the basis for the trading strategy regression produces comparable (USIG) or greater (in USHY) increases in the\nSharpe ratio of the High-Minus-Low relative value (HML-RV) strategy than is the case for the Basic quant strategy. Most\nimportantly, we find that relative value strategies based on combining the basic (rating, duration, and sector) and CreditEdge\n(default probability, downgrade probability, and Fair Value Spread) information sets produces HML-RV strategy Sharpe ratios that\nsignificantly exceed that of the benchmark in both USIG and USHY. The results are material. Representative Sharpe ratios of the\nCombined quant HML-RV strategies are 43% higher than the benchmark in both USIG and USHY.\nCombining the DP and FVS signals with ratings, duration, and sector information, for example, produces a Sharpe ratio for the\nHML residual strategy of 1.32 versus 0.92 for the index in USIG and a Share ratio of 0.86 versus 0.60 for the index in USHY. In\nclient work, we have often recommended combining the FVS and DP signals to identify bonds that are attractively valued for their\nlevel of default risk, without representing a false bargain due to a high risk of credit deterioration. Thus, the results of this paper\nstrengthen the notion that an HML-RV overlay to the index based on this information set could offer a potential mechanism for\nincreasing the information ratio of portfolio returns. Indeed, when we compute information ratios of HML-RV strategies as in\nGrinold and Kahn (2020), we find representative values of around 1.1 in USIG and 0.7 in USHY for the Combined quant\n2 Note that the mean standard deviations of individual bond spreads in both markets are less than the standard deviations of the respective mean spreads, in\nseeming violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This surprising result arises due to composition effects caused by the continual maturation of old\nbonds and inclusion of new bonds in the respective indices.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 5information set. These suggest that attractive opportunities for outperforming bond market benchmarks may exist for active fixed-\nincome managers who employ relative value ideas based on high-quality credit risk metrics.\nThe rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the dataset, including reporting on average cross-sectional\ncorrelations of spreads and risk metrics. Section 3 presents results of Granger-causality tests and SVAR models. Section 4 discusses\nexercises related to crossing high credit risk thresholds and subsequent spread changes. Section 5 examines the relationship\nbetween relative value and the cross-section of bond returns. Section 6 concludes.\n2. Data Description\nTo examine how default and downgrade risk historically relate to spreads over time, we reviewed the results of the backtests with\nthose for the Bloomberg Finance L.P. US investment-grade (USIG) and high-yield (USHY) indexes. The analysis is performed from\nJanuary 2007 through April 2020. The analysis in this paper is based on rated bonds and our CreditEdge metrics. The CreditEdge\nmetrics are updated every day.\nThe main metric we employ for credit risk and bond spread dynamics is the EDF (Expected Default Frequency), Moody’s Analytics\nprimary CreditEdge metric for the default probability of public firms, as documented in Nazeran and Dwyer (2015). This measure\ncomplements the Deterioration Probability (DP), which is a model-driven estimate of the one-year probability of downgrade or\ncredit quality deterioration for public firms, as described in Malone, Baron, and White (2018). We also employ the Fair Value\nSpread (FVS) which is a bond-level credit metric. The methodology for the FVS is documented in Dwyer et al. (2010).\nFor other bond metrics such as a bond’s OAS and duration, we used Refinitiv EJV for our reference data. Figure 1 shows the\nsummary statistics of the USIG and USHY universe we use in this paper: at first glance, the main characteristics of investment-\ngrade and high-yield segments are not at all similar. Unsurprisingly, default risk measured by EDF and downgrade risk assessed by\nDP are elevated in high yield relative to investment grade.\nFigure 1 Summary statistics:* USIG and USHY\nUSIG USHY\nData field Mean Median Stdev Description Mean Median Stdev Source\nEDF 0.3 0.2 0.2 Expected Default Frequency 3.0 2.5 2.0 CreditEdge\nDP 10.3 8.7 5.5 Deterioration Probability 15.8 14.8 5.8 CreditEdge\nFVS 149 135 63 Bond's Fair Value Spread 508 471 181 CreditEdge\nOAS 140 126 60 Option Adjusted Spread 549 496 242 Refinitiv EJV\nDuration 6.2 6.3 0.8 Bond's Duration 4.5 4.5 0.7 Refinitiv EJV\n*Figure 1 contains averages across bonds of bond-level monthly means, medians, and standard deviations. Figures for daily data are similar,\nhence omitted.\nOur Fair Value Spread (FVS) is a primary input to the Alpha Factor metric around which we build our commercial relative value\ninvestment strategy. The Alpha Factor is calculated at the bond level by dividing the bond’s OAS by the FVS. This ratio indicates\nwhether the security is overvalued or undervalued relative to its level of default risk. The main reason behind the outperformance\nof strategies built on Moody’s Analytics Alpha Factor appears to be that default risk, as represented by EDF metrics, is not fully\npriced into corporate bonds, and that relative value factor risk is rewarded in fixed-income markets. The FVS model additionally\ntakes into account market price of risk, loss given default (LGD), and liquidity in identifying which securities are relatively cheap—\nthat is, undervalued. In this paper, we focus in Section 5 on a more general set of relative value strategies.\n2.1. Mean cross-sectional correlations: Where’s the credit spread puzzle?\nWhen we compute time series means of the cross-sectional correlations of the EDF, DP, FVS, and spreads, we find the mean\ncorrelations of the OAS with risk metrics to be 0.34 for the EDF, 0.18 for the DP, and 0.72 for the FVS in USIG. In USHY, these\nfigures are 0.60, 0.47, and 0.58, respectively. The high average correlations between market and model spreads, of 0.72 and 0.58,\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 6are clearly at odds with the classic credit spread puzzle findings, as is the fact that the cross-sectional correlation is meaningfully\nhigher in USIG than USHY, in line with the findings of Feldhütter and Schaefer (2018).\n3. Time series predictability\nWe first explore the dynamics of credit spreads in relation to movements in the DP and EDF metrics using Granger-causality tests\nand SVAR models. Specifically, we address the following questions:\n» What is the time series correlation structure for changes in spreads and credit metrics?\n» Do credit metrics Granger-cause bond spreads in the aggregate and individually?\n» Do impulse-response curves from a SVAR model indicate potential opportunities for traders to respond quickly to\nrealized shocks to credit risk metrics?\nTo answer these questions, we conducted three exercises using our dataset of monthly frequency and daily frequency USIG and\nUSHY bond prices from January 2007 to the end of April 2020.\n3.1. Time series correlation graphs\nOur initial look at the lead-lag relationships between downgrade risk, default risk, and spreads starts by plotting the mean\nautocorrelations obtained across USIG bonds and USHY bonds, respectively. Results for the USIG universe are shown in Figure 2,\nwith results for the USHY universe shown in Figure 3.\nThe green lines in Figures 2 and 3 plot , for where k refers to the monthly lead\n(lag) of the DP change before (after) the OAS change.

On average, the correlation with the delta DP for k=-1 to k=-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 77 is 0.43% while it is 1.08% for k=+1 to k=+7. This shows that there is more correlation—more than double—between DP changes\nand future OAS changes than there is between OAS changes and future DP changes.\nInspecting the red line, we find that the correlation with the delta EDF peaks at k=1, with a value of 7.44%. On average, the\ncorrelation is 0.31% for k=-1 to k-7 and 1.98% for k=+1 to k=+7. The data shows that there is a stronger correlation between future\nDelta OAS and Delta EDF than there is between current OAS changes and future EDF changes—about 6 times more.\nPerhaps the most relevant implication for active asset managers from Figure 2 has to do with what these correlations imply for the\ninformation coefficient, or the cross-sectional correlation between signal and excess returns. As a back-of-the-envelope\ncalculation, the total bond return during a period can be approximated at a first order by the bond’s duration times the change in\nthe spread. Thus, correlations between risk metric changes in period t and next-month spread changes are indicative of possible\nranges for information coefficients. According to Grinold and Kahn (2020, p. 20), representative “good” and “great” information\ncoefficients are 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. In light of those reference points, the 0.0744 correlation value for the lagged delta EDF\nin Figure 2, and the correlation value around 0.10 for the lagged delta EDF in Figure 3 in USHY, both indicate levels consistent with\npotentially attractive information coefficients.\nTo ratify this intuition, we use a first order approximation of bond returns,\n,\nand then compute rt+1 a ≈nd 𝐷𝐷 𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡Δ𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑡𝑡+1 for the USIG and USHY markets.

The average OAS correlation with the simultaneous average EDF is quite high, at 0.86. This finding is\nnoteworthy, as no information on spreads is used to compute the EDF metric at the issuer level. The lagged average EDF values are\nalso associated with higher average credit spreads, with a 3-month lagged correlation of 0.59 and a 6-month lagged correlation of\n0.33, respectively. The p-values of the t-tests of each correlation against the null hypothesis of zero correlation are all well under\n1%, allowing us to comfortably reject the null hypothesis and confirming the significance of the correlation relationships.

All are statistically significant at conventional levels.\nWhen either measure of mean credit risk is above its time series average, contemporaneous and future mean spreads tend to be\nabove their historical average as well.\nFigure 5 displays similar level correlation results for the USHY market. The main difference between these results and the results in\nFigure 4 is that the correlations displayed for the EDF and DP with spreads are similar in magnitude within USHY. Also, the EDF\ncorrelations are somewhat higher in USHY than in USIG, as expected. Thus, there is evidence that the average level of default risk\nhas slightly greater absolute importance in the USHY market than in USIG, as expected, and slightly more relative importance in\nUSHY than downgrade risk, also in line with expectations. Given lingering doubt in the academic literature surrounding the ability\nof structural credit risk models to explain spreads, the absolute levels of the time series correlations are much higher than\nexpected in both markets, but especially in USIG.\nFigure 5 Correlation of mean bond spreads with lagged credit metrics: USHY, monthly\nEDF DP\nLag with OAS (month) 0 3 6 0 3 6\nCorrelation with OAS 0.89 0.64 0.36 0.88 0.65 0.43\nP-value < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001\n3.2. Granger-causality and SVAR results\nIn this section, we employ vector autoregression methods to study the evolution of a set of credit metrics in reaction to shocks in\none or more of those variables. We find that bond spreads are Granger-causal of, and Granger-caused by, default and downgrade\nrisks at the aggregate level. At the individual bond level, the prevalence of statistically significant Granger-causal relationships from\nEDFs to spreads is much higher than from downgrade probabilities to spreads. We also plot impulse responses for a Structural\nVector Autoregression (SVAR) of aggregate EDFs, DPs, Market Sharpe ratios, and credit spreads both USIG and USHY markets at\nthe monthly and daily frequencies. In what follows, subsection 3.2.1 presents Granger causality and SVAR results for aggregate\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 9spread data (that is, average spreads), and subsection 3.2.2 focuses on summarizing Granger causality test results for individual\nbonds at the daily frequency.\n3.2.1. Aggregate spreads and credit metrics: Granger-causality and SVAR results\nGranger-causality is a statistical notion of time series causality proposed by Clive Granger (1969). The reduced-form VAR model\nthat forms the Granger causality test is as follows:\n𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑐𝑐+𝐷𝐷1 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1+⋯+𝐷𝐷𝑝𝑝𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−𝑝𝑝+𝑏𝑏1 𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡−1+⋯+𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝 𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡−𝑞𝑞+𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡\nIn the above equation, p and q are lag lengths for the variables and , respectively, and the Granger-causality test is an F-test\nof the joint significance of the coefficients under the null hypothesis that they are all equal to zero. We report the p-\n𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡\nvalues of a series of bivariate Granger-causality tests of mean spreads paired with each of the mean EDF metric, the mean DP, and\nthe market Sharpe ratio (MSR). We display𝑏𝑏 r1 es,u…lts, 𝑏𝑏fo𝑝𝑝 r USIG first, for monthly and daily frequencies, and then results for USHY.\nFigure 6 Granger-causality tests to determine whether EDF (or DP) is useful in forecasting future credit spreads, and vice\nversa—Granger-causality tests of average OAS and average EDF (or DP): USIG, monthly\nP-VALUE EDF DP MSR\nLag 3 6 3 6 3 6\nDoes OAS move first? < .0001 0.006091 0.09167 0.06433 0.166 0.112\nDoes OAS move later? < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001\nFigure 6 displays results for the USIG market at the monthly frequency. We show results for two different lag lengths for\nrobustness. The key result is that, in USIG, there is some evidence that moves in mean spreads Granger-cause mean EDFs and the\nmean DP, but not the MSR. In the other direction, the statistical evidence that mean EDFs, DPs, and the MSR Granger-cause\naverage market spreads is overwhelming. In general, it appears that credit risk metrics tend to move before spreads at the monthly\nfrequency.\nWe repeat the same exercise with daily data, with results displayed in Figure 7. Results indicate strong Granger-causal connections\nfrom mean spreads to mean risk metrics and vice versa at both lag lengths used.\nFigure 7 Granger-causality tests to determine whether EDF (or DP) is useful in forecasting future credit spreads, and vice\nversa—Granger-causality tests of average OAS and average EDF (or DP): USIG, daily\nP-VALUE EDF DP MSR\nLag 10 20 10 20 10 20\nDoes OAS move first? < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001\nDoes OAS move later? < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001 < .0001\nIn Figure 8, we turn to USHY data at the monthly frequency. The statistical strength and robustness of the Granger-causality\nfindings are lower for USHY than in USIG, but the same conclusions generally hold: there is evidence that both spreads and risk\nmetrics Granger-cause each other at the aggregate level, except for the MSR: there is only evidence that the MSR Granger-causes\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 10mean spreads, but not the other way around. Also, result obtained using the 3-month lag are not as robust as those obtained using\nthe 6-month lag.\nFigure 8 Granger-causality tests to determine whether EDF (or DP) is useful in forecasting future credit spreads, and vice\nversa—Granger-causality tests of average OAS and average EDF (or DP): USHY, monthly\nP-VALUE EDF DP MSR\nLag 3 6 3 6 3 6\nDoes OAS move first? 0.0226 0.0400 0.0005 0.0006 0.7012 0.6547\nDoes OAS move later? 0.2283 < .0001 0.1840 0.0039 0.0064 0.0017\nFigure 9 displays daily aggregate USHY Granger-causality results.

They can also be identified through an AB scheme, which can reduce the burden\non placing some restrictions on either matrix if needed. As Luetkepohl (2017) notes, an A-model can be cast in AB form by\nspecifying B as a diagonal matrix, with the covariance matrix of the innovations set equal to the identity matrix. This is the\napproach we take here.\nWe estimate our SVAR using average US IG and HY data for the period January 2007 to April 2020 at both monthly and daily\nintervals. For each combination of (IG or HY) and (monthly or daily intervals), we applied the Vector Auto-Regression (VAR)\nmodels to mean EDF, mean DP, MSR, and mean Option-Adjusted Spreads (OAS). All models are estimated with that ordering of\nvariables.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 11In each of the figures below, we first show the estimated A and B matrices. Subsequently, for each case, we display three impulse\nresponse plots produced using the estimated SVAR models. The first shows the effect on average spreads of shocking the average\nEDF by one standard deviation at time zero. The second and third plots display the effect on average spreads of shocking average\nDP and MSR by one standard deviation at time zero. The impulse response plots cover horizons of 12 months for the monthly\ninterval data and 60 days for daily data.\nFigure 10 Structural vector autoregressive models—USIG: four variables, monthly\nEstimated A matrix Estimated B matrix\nEDF DP MSR OAS EDF DP MSR OAS\nEDF 1.0000 0.0000 0 0 EDF 0.1185 0.0000 0.0000 0.00\nDP -5.3760 1.0000 0 0 DP 0.0000 0.6122 0.0000 0.00\nMSR 0.0332 -0.0457 1 0 MSR 0.0000 0.0000 0.05833 0.00\nOAS -51.4496 -7.5239 -318.9 1 OAS 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 13.94\nSVAR impulse response from EDF SVAR impulse response from DP SVAR impulse response from MSR\nFigure 10 shows the structural vector autoregressive model results for USIG monthly data using six monthly lags (ρ = 6) and a 12-\nmonth time horizon. Clearly, the contemporaneous effects of shocks to risk variables on spreads are largest, and near-term horizon\neffects, for example, at the 1-2 month forecast horizon, are also large and statistically significant for the EDF and MSR, falling off\nover time. Effects of DP shocks on aggregate spreads appear to linger over several months, but bootstrapped confidence intervals\nshow that rejecting the null of a zero effect is difficult for the DP at most horizons.\nFigure 11 presents the impulse-response results for USIG based on daily mean data, for which we estimated the VAR models using\na ρ = 20 day lag. We display impulse-responses over a 60-day horizon. The daily SVAR impulse-responses indicate that credit risk\nshocks filter into spreads gradually over the first 10-20 trading days following the shock. This is especially evident for the EDF and\nMSR, but also applies to the DP.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 12Figure 11 Structural vector autoregressive models—USIG: four variables, daily\nEstimated A matrix Estimated B matrix\nEDF DP MSR OAS EDF DP MSR OAS\nEDF 1.0000 0.000e+00 0.0 0 EDF 0.04623 0.0000 0.0000 0.000\nDP -3.8689 1.000e+00 0.0 0 DP 0.00000 0.2318 0.0000 0.000\nMSR -0.0040 -6.212e-05 1.0 0 MSR 0.00000 0.0000 0.006 0.000\nOAS -5.2620 2.826e-01 -109.2 1 OAS 0.00000 0.0000 0.0000 2.918\nSVAR impulse response from EDF SVAR impulse response from DP SVAR impulse response from MSR\nFigures 12 and 13 show the same analysis using USHY monthly and daily data, respectively.

Daily bond-level spreads and credit metrics: Granger-causality results\nProducing and summarizing bond-level SVAR results for daily frequency data is somewhat cumbersome. However, a look at the\nresults of Granger-causality tests for such granular data reveals valuable insights on its own. We focus on results for daily\nfrequency individual bond data, because daily frequency results from Granger-causality tests and SVARs for aggregate bond data,\nreported in the previous subsection, suggest that aggregate spreads respond meaningfully to aggregate credit risk shocks. The\nresponse is not instantaneous, however, and takes about one month to be fully priced in. To be consistent with those exercises, we\nuse 20 trading days as the lag length for the VARs on which our Granger-causality tests are based here. All statements of statistical\nsignificance for Granger-causality tests involve a p-value threshold of 0.05.\nFigure 14 Histogram of bond-level Granger-causality test p-values after running the 20-day lag VAR model specification for\nall bonds in our dataset—Daily USIG\nEDF DP MSR\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 14Our results are as follows. In daily bond data for the USIG market, we find that the fraction of bonds for which credit metrics\nGranger-cause, the spread is 68% for the EDF, 50% for the DP, and 78% for the MSR. Histograms of p-values for the Granger-\ncausality test statistics across bonds in USIG are shown in Figure 14, with the EDF on the left, the DP in the middle, and results for\nthe MSR on the right. Before running the GC tests, we screened out bonds with less than 98% of trading days of available (non-\nmissing) spreads, as well as all bonds that exhibited a lack of variation in spreads and bonds with less than six months of data.\nFigure 15 displays results for the USHY market. In USHY, we find that the EDF metric Granger-causes spreads for fully 58% of\nbonds. The equivalent fraction for the DP is 52% of bonds, and 51% of bonds for the MSR. Thus, our tests indicate that all three\ncredit metrics, particularly our measures of default and downgrade probabilities, Granger-cause daily spread movements for over\nhalf of bonds in both the USIG and USHY markets.\nThe finding that the EDF has predictive power in-sample for between half and two-thirds of individual daily bond spreads in major\nindexes seems somewhat at odds with the spirit of the credit spread puzzle. The puzzle, to recall, contends that structural credit\nrisk models are generally unable to account for the levels of contemporaneous bond spreads, especially in USIG. To be fair, our\nexercises are focused on predicting subsequent spread movements, which is a different exercise than explaining spread levels. Fair-\nvalue spreads based on the EDF metric used in these exercises (based on version 1.0 of our FVS model) have a cross-sectional\ncorrelation of over 0.50 with bond spreads, however, although there is a basic adjustment made for liquidity, as proxied by\namount outstanding (Liu et al., forthcoming). Contemporaneous time series correlations between mean spreads and mean EDFs\nare much higher still, in the range of 0.86-0.89 for USIG and USHY markets, as shown in Figures 3 and 4 of this article.\nFigure 15 Histogram of bond-level Granger-causality test p-values after running the 20-day lag VAR model specification for\nall bonds in our dataset—Daily USHY\nEDF DP MSR\nIn monthly frequency Granger-causality tests for the universe of USIG bonds (not shown), we find that 83% of the p-values for the\nEDF exercise are less than 0.05, and that 18% of the p-values for the DP exercise are less than 0.05. Thus, the finding of\nwidespread Granger-causal linkages from credit metrics (especially default probabilities) and spreads is not unique to daily data.\nOverall, our findings from this section include the insight that EDF movements appear to Granger-cause spreads more strongly\nthan DP movements, and the one-month forward correlation between EDF changes and spread changes is higher than the\nequivalent correlation between changes in the DP and changes in spreads. Since DP levels appear more strongly correlated with\nspreads on a level basis on average, however, investment grade bonds for which spread levels do not accord with the downgrade\nrisk of the issuer likely merit further scrutiny.\n4. Bond spread behavior around high credit risk thresholds\nIn this section, we look at the dynamics of bond spreads around high thresholds of the DP and EDF metrics, which measure the\nprobabilities of rating downgrade and issuer default, respectively. This focus differs somewhat from estimating impulse-responses\nof spreads to EDF and DP shocks, as we did using SVAR models in Section 3, as here we measure the path spreads take on average\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 15following—and just prior to—high-risk threshold exceedances. This exercise therefore lies at the intersection of interests of credit\nrisk managers and quantitative portfolio managers or traders looking to take reasonable positions in particular bonds.\nOur main results for the USIG market are displayed in Figure 16, with results for the USHY market shown in Figure 17. The left\npanel of both figures displays results for the DP, and the right panel displays results for the EDF. Lines of different colors indicate\nspread paths around different high thresholds of the risk metric in question.\nSpecifically, in each figure, the x-axis displays the number of trading days t before and after the time zero event of the credit\nmetric crossing the designated high threshold. We plot results for t in the range [-60, 60]. The y-axis depicts the value of the\nOAS(t) minus OAS(0), where OAS(t) is the mean OAS of bonds in the relevant rating range at time t relative to the threshold\ncrossing event at time 0. The four thresholds for the lines displayed in each Figure represent the 80th, 90th, 96th, and 98th\npercentile values for the relevant metric (DP or EDF) and market (USIG or USHY) during the period of study.\nFigure 16 OAS movements in days (t) before and after reaching DP and EDF level: USIG\nUSIG DP USIG EDF\n30\n0\n-30\n-60\n-90\n-60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nFigure 17 OAS movements in days (t) before and after reaching DP and EDF level: USHY\nUSHY DP USHY EDF\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 16\n)0=t(SAO\nsunim\n)t(SAO\n36\n24\n12\n0\n-12\n-24\n15 25\n-36\n34 43\n-48\n-60-50-40-30-20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nbusiness days(t) before and after reached DP level\n)0=t(SAO\nsunim\n)t(SAO\n0.32 0.52\n0.98 1.41\nbusiness days(t) before and after reached EDF level\n120\n0\n-120\n-240\n-360\n-480\n-60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n)0=t(SAO\nsunim\n)t(SAO\n250\n125\n0\n-125\n-250\n22 32 -375\n48 62\n-500\n-60-50-40-30-20-10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nbusiness days(t) before and after reached DP level\n)0=t(SAO\nsunim\n)t(SAO\n2.62 6.39\n16.56 32.45\nbusiness days(t) before and after reached EDF levelExceedance of EDF thresholds in the 80-98th percentile range in USIG is associated with a rise in spreads of 13-30 bps,\nrespectively, over the next 20 trading days, and a rise in spreads of 33-182 bps over the same period in USHY. For the DP, the rise\nin spreads over 20 trading days equates to 6-15 bps in USIG and 24-93 bps in USHY for exceedance of DP thresholds in the 80-\n98th percentile range. Across bonds, average monthly OAS time series standard deviations are 60 bps in USIG and 242 bps in\nUSHY. Thus, spread changes following high EDF exceedances translate into 20-50% of the average monthly OAS standard\ndeviation in USIG and 14-75% of the monthly spread standard deviation in USHY. The equivalent percentages for the DP are 10-\n25% in USIG and 10-38% in USHY. These magnitudes are highly material in both fixed-income markets, and as expected, larger in\nUSHY. At the individual bond level, exceeding high levels of default and downgrade risk translates into large increases in spreads\nover the next month.\n5. Credit risk and the cross-section of bond returns\nHaving examined time series spread behavior conditional on credit risk metrics, and around high thresholds for default and\ndowngrade probabilities (time series predictability), we now look at whether misalignment of spreads with fair value implied by\nthose credit metrics helps to explain the cross-section of next-month bond returns (relative return predictability). We find that it\ndoes.\n5.1. A few simple pricing models for bond-level OAS\nThe basic premise of many statistical arbitrage strategies, including those studied here, is that deviations from reasonable\nestimates of fair value will revert to zero on average over time. The ability to gain exposure to such movements can generate\nattractive risk-adjusted returns.\nIn line with these ideas, we study three types of fair value models for bond spreads: those that model spreads as a function of bond\nspread duration, agency rating, and issuer industry (Basic quant models), those that model spreads as a function of CreditEdge\nmetrics, in particular some combination of the Fair Value Spread (FVS), Expected Default Frequency (EDF), and Deterioration\nProbability (DP) (CE quant models) and those that incorporate both sets of factors (Combined quant models).\nOur basic statistical arbitrage strategy involves running cross-sectional spread pricing regressions at the monthly frequency,\nextracting the residuals from those regressions, bucketing the index (USIG or USHY) into five duration buckets on each date, and\nsorting by model residual within each bucket. Within duration buckets, bonds are grouped into quintile portfolios by model\nresidual. Finally, we pool bonds in the relevant residual quintile portfolio across duration buckets and apply equal weights to form\nfive portfolios by residual quintile. The step of sorting within duration bucket and recombining is meant to ensure that the\nduration profile of each residual quintile portfolio resembles that of the index from which the underlying bonds are selected. This\nhelps ensure that unintended exposure to duration risk does not inadvertently affect our results.\nWe now describe our three cross-sectional regressions in more detail. Each can be viewed as a restriction of the following model:\n′ ′\n𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 =𝛼𝛼+𝛽𝛽⃑𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵,𝑡𝑡𝑋𝑋⃑𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵,𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽⃑𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,𝑡𝑡𝑋𝑋⃑𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡\nHere , where is the spread duration of bond i at time t, is\nthe issuer rating, and is a vector of 12 indus′try dummy variables that encode which of the 13 industries the issue\n𝑋𝑋⃑𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵,𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ≡(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡,𝑀𝑀𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡,𝐼𝐼��𝑛𝑛���𝐼𝐼���𝐷𝐷���𝐼𝐼���𝐷𝐷��𝑐𝑐��𝑦𝑦�⃑𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡) 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 𝑀𝑀𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑛𝑛𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡\nbelongs to.

Trading strategy results by residual quintile after adjustment for bond market risk factors\nThe geometric mean returns and Sharpe ratios for each investment strategy are shown in Figure 18 for the USIG market. In each\nblock of results, we also display the geometric mean USIG index return (5.87%) and Sharpe ratio (0.92) for comparison. The results\nfor the column labeled “High-Low” are based on the returns of the Top 20 strategy minus returns of the Bottom 20 strategy.\nThere are several noteworthy findings.\nFirst, quintile portfolio mean returns, Sharpe ratios, and IRs decrease monotonically by residual quintile portfolio for all statistical\narbitrage strategies tested. Further, the Top Quintile (Top 20% highest residual quintile) strategy outperforms the benchmark\nindex in terms of mean and risk-adjusted return measures for every model residual-based strategy considered. This illustrates that,\nat least before transactions costs, straightforward statistical arbitrage strategies in USIG appear to work well.\nSecond, we see that the mean returns and Sharpe ratios of the best CE quant strategies are slightly higher than the mean returns\nand risk-adjusted return measures of the Basic quant strategy, respectively. The Top 20 strategy employing a combination of the\nDP and the FVS metric, for example, produces a mean geometric return of 9.31%, compared to mean geometric return for the Top\n20 Basic Quant strategy of 8.95%.

These metrics improve upon those of the USIG index\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 18during the same period by 334 bps annually in the case of mean geometric returns and by 28% in the case of the Sharpe ratio.\nEven after applying reasonable transaction cost assumptions for USIG, there is clearly meaningful economic value to be extracted\nusing signals from the types of statistical arbitrage credit strategies considered here.\nFigure 19 shows the cumulative total returns for the High-Minus-Low Quintile FVS+DP combined quant relative value strategy.\nThe time period ranges from January 2007 to April 2020. The two key stylized facts to be gleaned from the figure are first, that the\nTop Quintile residual strategy outperforms the index, with the Bottom Quintile strategy underperforming, and second, that the\nTop Quintile strategy is more prone to crash risk at the onset of crisis periods. However, the Top Quintile strategy tends to\nrebound much more quickly during the latter half of crisis periods as well. Thus, it seems reasonable to interpret relative value\nstrategies as earning a value premium in fixed income, with some associated negative return skewness, or crash risk, associated\nwith highly volatile periods during which the supply of risk arbitrage capital dries up. This interpretation is consistent with the fact\nthat the Top Quintile strategy recovered strongly during the April 2020 COVID-19 period as soon as the Fed began injecting\nunprecedented liquidity into bond markets. There is also some evidence that liquidity-dependent crash risk is less for some other\nimplementations of the strategy (Liu et al., forthcoming). In contrast to relative value strategies in fixed-income, quality-based\nstrategies based on EDF sorts of bonds outperformed during the initial phase of COVID-19, even before monetary and fiscal policy\nactions were in place to stabilize markets, as well as afterward (Choi, Levine, and Malone, 2020).\nFigure 20 displays results on strategy performance by residual quintile for the USHY market, as well as geometric average returns\nand Sharpe ratios for the USHY benchmark portfolio and the HML portfolio. We find several similarities with the results for the\nUSIG market, but also some key differences.\nFigure 19 Top and Bottom Quintile FVS+DP residual performance versus the index: USIG, cumulative return\n4.5\n3.7\n2.9\n2.1\n1.3\n0.5\nJan07 Mar09 May11 Jul13 Sep15 Nov17 Jan20\nHigh 20% Index Low 20%\nSimilarities include the finding that mean returns are monotonically decreasing by residual quintile for the relative value strategies.\nThis result generally holds true across strategies for all types of information sets. Also, we find that mean returns for the Top\nQuintile residual strategies are generally substantially higher than those of the index, just as we found in USIG. Most importantly,\nwe recover the result that the mean returns and Sharpe ratios of the HML strategies are higher than those of the USHY index for\nnearly all the CE quant and Combined quant information sets.\nDifferences in the results are as follows. First, the Sharpe ratios of the quintile strategies do not increase monotonically by quintile\nlike the mean returns do. Rather, they peak in the second or third quintiles, due to the high return volatility of the Top Quintile\nstrategies. Second, the Basic quant relative value strategy (both HML and Top Quintile) underperforms the index. This is a bit\nsurprising but serves to illustrate the fact that high-quality credit risk metrics—such as the CE quant information set—are key to\nachieving outperformance in the USHY market.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 19For the Combined quant strategy using the DP and FVS metrics, the Sharpe ratio of the HML strategy is 0.86, compared to 0.60 for\nthe index. This represents a 43% improvement, which is the same magnitude that we observe for this same HML strategy in the case\nof the USIG market versus that index. Given the modest correlation of the HML strategy with the market index, of 0.64, it is no\nsurprise that the HML strategy produces a high information ratio versus the market benchmark, too. Results on the estimated bond\nmarket CAPM alphas and information ratios (computed as alpha divided by the standard deviation of the CAPM error term, as in\nGrinold and Kahn, 2020) are shown in the Appendix. Figure 26 reports results for USIG and Figure 27 reports results for USHY.\nIn USIG, the annualized alpha and IR for the Combined quant HML strategy using the DP and FVS metrics from CreditEdge are\n4.34% per annum and 1.19, respectively. In USHY, the annualized alpha and IR for the same strategy are 4.90% and 0.69.\nCombined quant strategy IRs for the HML strategies range from 1.00 to 1.21 in USIG and 0.41 to 0.94 in USHY. Both ranges\nrepresent attractive information ratios versus the benchmark.\nFigure 20 Residual strategy performance: USHY, geometric average return, Sharpe ratio, and information ratio\nSTRATEGY METHODOLOGY REPORTING HIGH-LOW INDEX TOP20 TOP20 40 TOP40 60 TOP60 80 BOTTOM20\nBlock 1.

Spread compression (widening) versus the index for portfolios of under-(over-)valued bonds\nThe standard way that relative value strategies are implemented using CreditEdge metrics is through the Alpha Factor, which is\nmost commonly calculated as the bond’s OAS divided by the FVS of the bond model. An alternative implementation is the\nDifference Alpha Factor, which is calculated as the bond’s OAS minus its FVS. In relation to the results presented in sections 5.a\nand 5.b, the Difference Alpha Factor is similar to sorting bonds using residuals of the CreditEdge quant regression of the OAS on\nthe FVS, but with the slope coefficient restricted to equal 1.0. The Alpha Factor sort is roughly akin to sorting on the residuals of\nthe similarly restricted regression, but in logarithmic (or transformed inverse logit3) form. Since results obtained using either of the\nAlpha Factor definitions are somewhat similar (albeit with the ratio version tending to outperform the DAF in USHY), we focus on\nthe first of them based on the OAS/FVS ratio.\nWe have already seen that simple statistical arbitrage ideas produce attractive results in fixed income markets. Indeed, as we\ndocument elsewhere (Liu et al., forthcoming), evidence from the return profile of Top Quintile strategies for the Alpha Factor sort\nsuggests that the Alpha Factor implements a value factor in fixed income, combined with capturing what may be a modest\npremium for mispricing.\nHere we test the ability of the Alpha Factor to identify portfolios of bonds that outperform (or underperform) the index in terms of\nspread compression over time, and to measure the average extent of such spread compression. To do this, we divide the index into\nfive duration buckets, as before, and rank bonds by Alpha Factor within each bucket. We then identify the Top Quintile and\nBottom Quintile sets of bonds by Alpha Factor within each duration bucket and track the mean change in the OAS of bonds in\neach set, minus the mean change of the OAS for the duration bucket over time. We average across duration bucket and plot the\nresult versus time over the following 18 months. Compression, or negative changes, for the mean OAS of the Top Quintile Alpha\nFactor group allows us to conclude that most of the outperformance has come from spread tightening versus the benchmark. The\n3 Running a regression of log spreads on covariates runs into the problem of having to drop missing values for bonds with negative spreads. An alternative\nformulation that gets around this problem is to run a regression of log(y/(1-y)) on covariates, where y is defined as (OAS – OAS_min)/(OAS_max-\nOAS_min), given in-sample maximum and minimum values for the spread in-sample. Relative value strategies based on residuals from such a regression\nperform almost identically to the strategies we discuss in this paper for USIG. For USHY, however, they outperform strategies based on residuals from the\nlevel spread regression setup. We can think of this result arising from the fact that negative spreads are less prevalent in USHY, and that other things equal\n(which they typically are not), “ratio-based” regression residuals tend to provide slightly better signals than “difference-based.”\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 21same analysis can be done within DTS (duration times spread) bucket portfolios. DTS, as described Ben Dor et al. (2007), is\nregarded by many market participants as a more robust measure of risk in bond markets than the spread duration.\nFigure 22 plots the results for the USIG market and Figure 23 plots results for USHY. Note that the spread change reported for a\ngiven time point, for example, month t+1, is based on averaging across initial starting months t during the 2007-2020 sample.\nFigure 22 The value gain/loss after a bond is added to the best/worst 20% groups can persist - USIG: average cumulative\nbond spread change vs. the benchmarks, bp (2007-2020)*\nTop Quintile Alpha Factor Bottom Quintile Alpha Factor\n0\n-6\n-12\n-18\n-24\n1 4 7 10 13 16\n* Mean delta OAS (bond) – mean delta OAS (index) within the same duration (or DTS) bucket, averaged across buckets\nThe two panels in Figure 22 show the average cumulative spread tightening for Top Quintile Alpha Factor portfolios and widening\nfor the Bottom Quintile Alpha Factor portfolios. For example, in the month after the bonds were added to the Top20 portfolios,\nthe portfolios outperformed the USIG index by 3 bps on average for duration groupings. This is consistent with the idea that the\nAlpha Factor framework may identify bonds that are mispriced, with default risk being the main determinant of fair prices. The\nspread in the Top Quintile portfolios tightened by 10 bps for the DTS bucketing scheme versus about 21 bps for the duration\nbucketing scheme after 18 months. On the other hand, the spread in the Bottom Quintile portfolios underperformed (widened) by\n3 bps on average after one month. The spread in the Bottom Quintile portfolios underperformed on average by 15 bps under the\nduration bucketing scheme versus 13 bps using DTS bucket after 18 months. These results illustrate that, in contrast to the\nrelatively rapid (10-20 trading day horizon) incorporation of shocks to average credit risk into aggregate bond spreads shown in\nSection 3.2.1, spread compression of portfolios of undervalued bonds relative to the index can persist for well over 12 months into\nthe future.\nFigure 23 displays results for the USHY market. For duration-based buckets, the average spread compression of undervalued bonds\nin the top Alpha Factor quintile by duration group goes from around 15 bps after one month to about 68 bps after 18 months. For\nBottom Quintile Alpha Factor bonds, spread widening ranges from 14 bps after a month to 85 bps after 18 months for the\nduration bucketing scheme. Curiously, for the DTS scheme, spread widening occurs, but is significantly more muted. For the high\nAlpha Factor set, in contrast, duration and DTS bucketing schemes exhibit similar spread compression. These results for spread\ncompression versus spread widening by bucketing scheme are reversed for the USIG market in Figure 22. The key empirical point is\nthat, using either scheme, spread compression (or widening) versus index bonds occurs and can persist for well over one year for\ninitial undervalued (overvalued) bonds identified by the initial Alpha Factor ratio.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 22\n)spb(\nSAO\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n1 4 7 10 13 16\n18\nmonth=k\nDTS Duration\nOAS\n(bps)\n18\nmonth=k\nDTS DurationFigure 23 The value gain/loss after a bond is added to the best/worst 20% groups can persist - USHY: average cumulative\nbond spread change vs. the benchmarks, bp (2007-2020)*\nTop Quintile Alpha Factor Bottom Quintile Alpha Factor\n0\n-17\n-34\n-51\n-68\n-85\n1 4 7 10 13 16\n* Mean delta OAS (bond) – mean delta OAS (index) within the same duration (or DTS) bucket, averaged across buckets\n5.4. Sector-level convergence of model residuals to the mean\nHaving examined a class of strategies for exploiting reversion of bond spreads to fair values, as well as the extent of spread\ncompression/widening relative to the index for a simple relative value strategy, we now turn to the sector dimension of the\nrelative value phenomenon. Again, for simplicity we focus here on the Alpha Factor metric, which is defined as the ratio of the\nOAS of a bond to its FVS.\nA sector-level version of the relative value convergence test is as follows: Do sectors with the highest and lowest mean OAS/FVS\nratios see those ratios converge to the average, and if so, on what timescale does this occur?\nTo test this question, we use the 13 sector categories covered in the bond model that produces the FVS estimates. Using data\nfrom January 2007 to the end of April 2000, we computed the mean Alpha Factor, or OAS/FVS ratio, by sector each month. We\nthen identified the sectors with the largest and smallest ratios each month and tracked the path of the mean sector OAS/FVS\nratios for these sectors over the 20 months following the initial date. By averaging the results of this exercise over initial starting\ndates, we can form a picture of the mean convergence paths for the Max mean Alpha Factor and Min mean Alpha Factor sectors,\nrespectively. The path for both Max and Min sectors for the USIG market is shown in Figure 24.\nIn the initial month, the average Alpha Factor for the sector with the Max Alpha Factor is 3.2 versus 0.3 for the Min Alpha Factor\nsector. By the first month, 59% of the initial gap of 2.9 between the mean Alpha Factor of the Max and Min sectors is eliminated,\nwith the highest Alpha Factor sector converging somewhat faster. By month 20, the gap completely closes as the lines intersect.\nThus, initial convergence is quick, but then the remaining 41% of the gap takes 19 additional months to disappear.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 23\n)spb(\nSAO\n85\n68\n51\n34\n17\n0\n18\n1 4 7 10 13 16\nDTS Duration month=k\nOAS\n(bps)\n18\nDTS Duration month=kFigure 24 The average Alpha Factor for each sector converges - USIG: average Alpha Factor for sector\n3.3\n2.7\n2.1\n1.5\n0.9\n0.3\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nFigure 25 The average Alpha Factor for each sector converges - USHY: average Alpha Factor for sector\nFigure 25 displays equivalent results on sector Alpha Factor convergence for the USHY market. At the end of month 0, when Max\nand Min Alpha Factor sectors are identified, we find the mean Alpha Factor gap equals 2.3. After one month, this shrinks to a gap\nof 1.6, eliminating 30% of the initial gap. Convergence continues during the ensuing 19 months. Unlike what we saw for the USIG\nmarket, however, the terminal gap size appears to asymptote out at around 0.8, or around 35% of the initial gap size. Whether the\ngreater persistence of sector-level differences in mean over- or under-valuation in USHY is linked to lower liquidity or some other\nfactor is unclear. What our results allow us to conclude is that, in both USIG and USHY markets, there is strong evidence that a\nsignificant degree of convergence in relative valuation at the sector level back to the mean for extreme over- or under-valued\nsectors occurs.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 24\nrotcaF\nahplA\negarevA\nMax Min\nmonth\n3.2\n2.7\n2.2\n1.7\n1.2\n0.7\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nrotcaF\nahplA\negarevA\nMax Min month6. Conclusion\nIn this article, we apply a range of tests to evaluate the existence and strength of different types of dynamic relationships between\ncredit metrics and bond spreads. Despite doubts in the academic literature about the ability of structural credit risk models to explain\nthe level of observed spreads, it is apparent that contemporaneous-level correlations between the mean default probability from a\ncommercial structural credit risk model and mean bond spreads are quite high: 0.86 in USIG and 0.89 in USHY. Perhaps more\nimportantly for institutional investors, there is robust evidence that credit risk metrics help predict time series movements of spreads\nas well as the cross-section of relative returns. In particular, default and downgrade probabilities have robust in-sample predictive\npower for spreads at the aggregate and individual bond levels. Bond spreads tend to rise considerably both prior to—and following—\nthe breach by their issuers of high default and downgrade risk thresholds. Deviations of spreads from fair value implied by credit risk\nmetrics help explain the cross section of next-month bond returns. The Sharpe ratios of high-minus-low residual strategies based\non cross-sectional regressions improve upon those of the market benchmarks by 43% in both USIG and USHY. At the aggregate\nlevel, we observe the phenomenon that the mean ratio of market spreads to a measure of fair value spreads for the most under-\nvalued and over-valued sectors tends to converge toward common levels over time. Collectively, the empirical regularities that we\ndocument in this paper are likely to have relevance for fixed-income traders, security selection, asset allocation, and the active\nmanagement of bond portfolios.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT RISK AND BOND SPREADS: DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TRADING STRATEGIES 257.
