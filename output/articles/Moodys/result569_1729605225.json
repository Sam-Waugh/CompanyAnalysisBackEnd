We constructed these scenarios\nby adjusting the reference scenario GDP paths for the impact of chronic physical risk implied by the\ncorresponding climate pathway over the full forecast horizon, through 2100.\nMoody’s ESG sovereign climate risk scores measure country-level physical risk exposure from floods,\nheat stress, hurricanes and typhoons, sea-level rise, water stress, and wildfires on population, GDP\npurchasing power parity, and agricultural area. This paper illustrates how sovereign climate risk scores\ncan be incorporated into Physical Risk economic scenarios as an enhancement.\nWe first introduce the MESG sovereign climate risk scores and discuss our current methodology of\ncreating the Physical Risk economic scenario. We then present our correlation study and regression\nresults by linking the sovereign climates scores to the physical risk damage estimates. This allows us\nto integrate the MESG sovereign climate risk scores into the Physical Risk economic scenarios. In the\nconclusion, we summarize our findings and discuss the benefits of incorporating sovereign climate risk\nscores into economic scenarios. These scores enable us to conduct Physical Risk economic scenarios\nwithout relying solely on chronic physical risk estimates.\nMoody’s ESG sovereign climate risk scores1\nMethodology\nMoody’s ESG sovereign climate risk scores measure sovereign physical climate risk exposure from\nsix climate hazards based on population, GDP purchasing power parity, and agricultural area.\nThese scores are generated by first identifying populated areas of a country that have high exposure\nto each climate hazard and then identifying the total and relative portion of population, GDP\npurchasing power parity, and agricultural area in these highly exposed areas.\n1 “Measuring What Matters: A New Approach to Assessing Sovereign Climate Risk,” J. Naviaux et al., Moody’s Analytics, December 2020. Moody’s\nESG / Insights & Analysis / Measuring What Matters: A New Approach to Assessing Sovereign Climate Risk\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate Change SCenarioS and meSg Climate riSk SCoreS 2We identify areas as high risk from each hazard if they meet the following criteria:\nFloods: Exposed to at least 0.2 meter of flooding during a 1-in-100-year pluvial or fluvial\nflood event.\nHeat stress: Exposed to relatively high fluctuations in temperature extremes compared with\nthe global average.\nHurricanes and typhoons: Situated in the regular path of cyclones.\nSea-level rise: Exposed to at least some shoreline flooding during a 1-in-100-year coastal\nflood event.\nWater stress: Currently experiences high water stress or water supplies are diminishing, and/\nor competition is expected to increase.\nWildfires: Has a high wildfire potential with sizable increases in future wildfire potential\nseverity and high-risk days.\nThree scores are available at the aggregate level:\nPercent score: Aggregate total percentile score across all climate hazards based on the\npercent of population, GDP purchasing power parity, and agricultural area exposed.\nAbsolute score: Absolute aggregate total percentile score across all climate hazards based\non the absolute sum measures of population, GDP purchasing power parity, and agricultural\narea exposed.\nFinal score: Total aggregate percentile score across all climate hazards based on both the\npercent and absolute scores.\nAs shown in Charts 1 and 2, incorporating both the absolute and percent exposure into the final score can\nhave large impacts on the rankings, compared with the score using only the percent exposure. Countries\nwith large populations and wealthy economies see their scores go up significantly when factoring in the to-\ntal exposure. Take the U.S. as an example. Its risk score based on percent exposure is 49.2, but its final score\nis 98.4, driven by its high absolute exposure to climate risks in terms of population, GDP and agricultural\narea. That is because the U.S.’s percent score is normalized for the size of its economy, whereas its absolute\nscore is not. In contrast, Belize, which faces very high risk from several climate hazards, has a high percent\nscore of 94.7, but due to its small population, GDP and agricultural area, its final score is only 46.5, moving\nit to the lower half of the risk distribution. For countries such as Denmark and the Philippines, the two scores\nare very similar and factoring in the absolute exposure does not have a material impact on their climate risk\nrankings. Denmark has a percent score of 16 and a final score of 16.6, while the Philippines has a percent score\nof 97.3 and a final score of 99.5. The key reason for this variation is the difference in the population of these\ntwo countries. Denmark’s small population and the Philippines’ large population allow these two countries to\nmaintain their final risk scores at the low and high end of the rankings, respectively.\nChoosing between the final score and the percent score will depend on the use case. For instance, if the goal\nis to get a sense of the raw amounts of social and economic capital within a sovereign that should be safe-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate Change SCenarioS and meSg Climate riSk SCoreS 3guarded against climate hazards, then the final score or the absolute score is the better choice since they\nfactor in the total exposure. However, if the goal is to get a sense of the sovereign’s potential ability to absorb\nand recover from climate shocks and stresses, the percent score is the better option, since it measures the\nrelative exposure.\nIn this paper, we are interested in linking country damage functions to the MESG sovereign climate risk score.\nIn the climate literature, damage functions estimate the relationships between climate variables and economic\nvariables to translate the effects of physical climate risk to the economy. Since damage functions are usually\nmeasured in relative terms such as percentage of GDP, productivity or income, we believe it is more appropriate\nto use the MESG percent score. Our analysis presents results using both the percent score and final score, and\nwe find that empirically, the percent score also yields slightly better outcomes.\nCurrent methodology of constructing the Physical Risk economic scenario2\nMoody’s Analytics focuses on the following five channels through which climate change affects the econo-\nmy in creating the Physical Risk scenario:\n» Sea-level rise\n» Human health effects\n» Heat effect on labor productivity\n» Agricultural productivity\n» Tourism\nTo quantify the economic effects from these channels, we rely on the damage function estimates by Roson\nand Sartori (2016),3 who employ a series of meta-analyses to establish a connection between climate change\nand economic outcomes. Incorporating interdisciplinary information, these estimates link temperature\nfluctuations to each impact channel for all major countries. This approach suits regulatory guidance well\nsince projected temperature paths are often a key input in predicting climate change. As an example, Table\n1 displays Roson and Sartori’s estimated heat impacts on labor productivity by sector and country for vari-\nous degree increases.\nTo translate temperature pathways into macroeconomic scenarios, we first create a quarterly RCP 8.5\ntemperature path to match the Moody’s Analytics Global Model’s frequency. We then overlay key economic\nlevers in the model that shape economic scenarios to reflect the damages implied by warmer temperature\n(see Chart 3). Specifically, we rely on three top-line variables. First, sea-level rise affects consumption. Second,\ntourism changes net exports. Both directly flow into real GDP. Finally, agricultural impacts, heat stress, and\n2 Moody’s Analytics has used this methodology to produce the Physical Risk scenarios for Network for Greening the Financial System, HKMA, and\nthe Bank of England’s Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario. For more details, see “Climate Risk Macroeconomic Forecasting,” J. Licari et al.,\nMoody’s Analytics, January 2021; “Macroeconomic Expansion of the HKMA Climate Change Stress Test,” M. DiNatale et al., Moody’s Analytics,\nJune 2021; and “Macroeconomic Expansion of the Bank of England Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario,” M. Brisson et al., Moody’s Analytics,\nJuly 2021. https://www.economy.com/products/alternative-scenarios/scenarios-climate-change and https://www.economy.com/databuffet/\npreview/reference\n3 Roberto Roson and Martina Sartori, “Estimation of Climate Change Damage Functions for 140 Regions in the GTAP9 Database,” World Bank\nGroup Policy Research Working Paper 7728, June 2016.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate Change SCenarioS and meSg Climate riSk SCoreS 4other human health effects all have productivity effects that flow into industry contributions to overall GDP\nand disposable income. Once these central variables are in place, they then cascade through the rest of the\nGlobal Model to influence broad outcomes ranging from unemployment to housing prices.\nThe time series of overlays are weighted averages of the impact channels per degree of warming, with the\nweights being the global mean temperature increases in the scenarios, assuming a linear impact. For ex-\nample, if a temperature increase is 1.4°C in a given quarter of a scenario, we added 60% of the impact esti-\nmate for a 1°C change and 40% of the 2°C estimate to determine the change in the impact channel relative\nto the baseline in that quarter. In calculating the productivity impact caused by heat stress and changes in\nagricultural productivity, because these are largely sector-specific shocks, we need an additional step to ac-\ncount for the industrial composition of a country. For agricultural productivity, once we have a time series\nof calculated deviations from the baseline, we then multiply those by the agricultural share of each econ-\nomy. Once a time series of impacts has been calculated for each sector—agriculture, manufacturing and\nservices—we then multiply that series by the size of that sector relative to the size of the overall economy.\nAfter calculating a time series for the three channels through which climate change affects productivity and\nadjusting them to account for their relevant industrial share, these impact channels are aggregated into a\nsingle time series overlay for real potential productivity.\nEnhancing the current approach with the MESG sovereign climate risk scores\nMoody’s Analytics quantifies physical risk by leveraging country-specific damage functions as presented\nby Roson and Sartori. If these functions can be reasonably predicted by the MESG sovereign climate risk\nscores, the current approach can be enhanced by replacing the country-specific damage functions with a set\nof damage functions estimated based on the MESG sovereign climate risk scores.\nThe main benefit of integrating the MESG sovereign climate risk scores into the climate economic sce-\nnario is the ability to consider alternative scenarios by adjusting our assumptions of sovereign climate\nrisk. Sovereign physical risk may not be static over time, and the current interpolation method allows\nfor only temperature change but not change in sovereign climate risk. The MESG sovereign climate risk\nscores provide a mechanism to alter sovereign climate risk exposures in the climate scenarios. For in-\nstance, given a temperature pathway, we can now conduct sensitivity analysis to test what happens if\nsovereign climate risk is significantly above or below its current level by altering its sovereign climate risk\nscore in the model. Moreover, when scenario-conditioned sovereign climate risk scores become available\nin the future, we can easily incorporate them into the climate economic scenarios as part of the climate\nstress-testing exercise.\nCorrelation study\nThe MESG sovereign climate risk score provides a measure of the degree of socioeconomic exposure to a\nhigh degree of projected physical climate risk. It is based on the mapping of the co-occurrence of hazards\nand exposures, explicitly factoring in the spatial heterogeneity of both climate hazards and people and eco-\nnomic activities across a country. Therefore, we expect the MESG sovereign climate risk score to correlate\nwell with the damage estimates in Roson and Sartori. Out of Roson and Sartori’s five impact channels,\nsea-level rise and the heat effect on labor productivity correspond directly to the sea-level rise and heat\nstress climate hazard that underpin the MESG climate risk score. For the human health effects impact chan-\nnel, Roson and Sartori considered some vector-borne diseases (malaria, dengue, schistosomiasis), heat- and\ncold-related diseases, and diarrhea, which correspond to the heat stress and water stress climate hazard in\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate Change SCenarioS and meSg Climate riSk SCoreS 5the MESG climate risk score. For the agricultural productivity impact channel, the MESG climate risk score\nassesses exposure of agricultural areas to all six climate hazards, capturing the critical risks to agricultural\nproductivity. Finally, for the tourism channel, all six climate hazards that underpin the MESG climate risk\nscore can influence tourism attractiveness.\nTo investigate whether MESG sovereign physical risk scores may be useful in predicting economic damages,\nwe first computed the correlations between the Roson and Sartori impact estimates and MESG sovereign\nclimate risk scores by impact channel and temperature fluctuation. Table 2 summarizes the results. Except\nfor the sea-level rise channel, we found negative correlations between -0.3 to -0.7 for all impact channels\nand most temperature fluctuations. This is consistent with the intuition that countries with higher climate\nrisk scores face greater physical climate risks and experience larger economic damages. The correlations are\nalso stronger for the normalized percent scores than the final scores. For the sea-level rise channel, since\nthe Roson and Sartori damage estimates are near zero for most countries, it is not surprising that the cor-\nrelations are very low.\nRegression study\nNext, we sought to represent the Roson and Sartori impact estimates as a function of the country climate\nrisk score and temperature fluctuation for each impact channel c:\n𝑐𝑐\nFor the health impac𝐶𝐶t 𝐶𝐶c𝐶𝐶ha𝐶𝐶n𝐶𝐶n𝐶𝐶e𝐶𝐶l, 𝐷𝐷sin𝐷𝐷c𝐷𝐷e 𝐷𝐷th𝐷𝐷e𝐷𝐷 R𝐷𝐷o𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖son and Sartori impact estimates are available only for +10C, we\nestimated the following linear regression without using temperature change as an explanatory variable:\n= α + β*CountryScore + к *(CountryScore*Georegion)+e\ni i it\nℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ\nFor all ot𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶h𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶er𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 i𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶m𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶p𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶a𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶c t𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 c𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ha𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷n𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ne𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ls𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷w𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖e estimated the following linear regression for each impact channel c:\n= α + β*CountryScore+ γ*TempChange + θ*( CountryScore *\ni t i\nTempChange) + λ*(T𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐empChange*Georegion)+ к*(CountryScore*Georegion)+e\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷t 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 t i i it\nAccording to Roson and Sartori, there will be winners and losers as the climate changes. Charts 4 and 5\nillustrate this phenomenon for a selected number of countries in the agricultural impact channel. As tem-\nperature rises, agricultural productivity increases in Sweden, the U.K. and Russia but declines in Cambodia\n(not shown), Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. The impact estimates are positive and upward-sloping with\ntemperature change for countries that benefit, but they are negative and downward-sloping for countries\nthat lose. Moreover, winners and losers do not always align with the climate risk score. For example, Cam-\nbodia has a final climate risk score of 34.2, but it loses big in the agricultural channel with climate change,\nwhile Russia has a final risk score of 62.6, but it is expected to gain.\nTherefore, we needed a richer model beyond a basic linear model with only country risk score and tem-\nperature to capture the bifurcation of impact estimates. We introduced a georegion dummy variable into\nthe regression because the economic effects of climate change can vary significantly across regions. The\ngeoregion dummy and interaction terms into the models allow the impact estimates to vary nonlinearly\nin a dimension other than country risk score and temperature. Additionally, adding the georegion dummy\nimproves model fit significantly and ensures that the signs of the coefficient on the temperature change\nvariable and country score variable align with our intuition. The georegions are East Asia and Pacific, Eastern\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate Change SCenarioS and meSg Climate riSk SCoreS 6Europe and Central Asia, the EU, the rest of Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, North America, and South Asia.\nTables 3 through 7 summarize the regression results for each impact channel using either the final score\nor the percent score as the country climate risk score. In general, using the percent score leads to better\nin-sample fits with a higher adjusted R-squared. This makes sense because the percent scores are normal-\nized for the size of the economy, as are the Roson and Sartori impact estimates. After taking the interaction\nterms into consideration, the effects of the country climate risk score are mostly negative, regardless of\nwhich score we used as the country climate risk score. The poor in-sample fits of the sea-level rise impact\nchannel regression are consistent with the low correlations we discussed earlier. This is likely due to the\nlarge number of zeros in the sea-level rise impact estimates from the Roson and Sartori study.\nNext, to compute the GDP and productivity overlays for the RCP 8.5 temperature pathway, we aggregat-\ned up the regression predictions for each impact channel except the sea-level rise channel because the\nmodel fits are poor.\nCharts 6 through 13 show the comparison between the regression-based aggregate overlay estimates and\nthe interpolation-based aggregate overlay estimates (current methodology) for the U.K. and Hong Kong.\nFor the tourism channel, the regression approach captures the bifurcation of impact on GDP: The predicted\nimpact on U.K. GDP is positive and increases as the temperature rises, while the impact on Hong Kong GDP\nis negative and decreases as the temperature rises. For the productivity channel, the regression approach\ncan also capture the negative and decreasing impact on productivity for both the U.K. and Hong Kong.\nMoreover, which score to use as the country climate risk may not matter much because the regression pre-\ndictions are very similar.\nConclusion\nWe have provided empirical evidence to show that the Roson and Sartori country-specific climate damage\nestimates are negatively correlated with Moody’s ESG sovereign climate risk scores, and they can be es-\ntimated as functions of the sovereign climate risk scores and temperature changes. Replacing our current\ninterpolation method with the estimated functions will allow us to incorporate MESG sovereign climate risk\nscores directly into Moody’s Analytics Physical Risk economic scenarios.\nThe benefits of integrating sovereign climate risk scores into economic scenarios are twofold. First, sover-\neign physical risk exposure may not be static over time. Our current interpolation method can account for\nonly temperature change. The sovereign climate risk scores provide a way for us to account for change in\nsovereign climate risk exposure as well. Second, when scenario-conditioned sovereign climate risk scores\nbecome available in the future, we will be able to easily incorporate them into economic scenarios to fur-\nther enhance our climate stress-test framework. In future work, we intend to expand our analysis to inves-\ntigate how to incorporate MESG subnational climate risk scores into economic scenarios to account for\nsubnational climate risk exposure.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Climate Change SCenarioS and meSg Climate riSk SCoreS 7Chart 1: Climate Risk Score‒Percent\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Date 1\nChart 2: Climate Risk
