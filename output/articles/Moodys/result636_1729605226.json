Given the short timescales for implementation and amount of effort required,\nmuch of this work is naturally focused on the immediate job to be done: producing financial\nContact Us statements and other required disclosures, for reporting periods from January 1, 2021.\nAmericas\nHowever, the introduction of IFRS 17 ultimately requires insurance companies to be able to\n+1.212.553.1653\ndo more than calculate and report the new financial statements. Insurers and their investors\nEurope\nwill also want to understand how these financial statements might evolve in the future under\n+44.20.7772.5454\ndifferent scenarios. Gaining such an understanding is particularly important given the specific\nAsia-Pacific\n+852.3551.3077 characteristics of IFRS 17, and how it differs from other reporting standards. New concepts such\nas the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) fundamentally change the timing of reported profit\nJapan\n+81.3.5408.4100 and loss.\nFurthermore, since IFRS 17 is a principles-based standard, insurance companies have several\nimmediate decisions to make in relation to their particular implementation of the standard.\nTransition methodology, level of contract grouping, choice of coverage units, and methodology\nfor calculation of the risk adjustment are just a few examples of the decisions that need to be\nmade. These choices don’t just impact the IFRS 17 balance sheet at transition, but also affect\nthe sensitivity of the future balance sheet and the emergence of profit and loss.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: GAINING BUSINESS INSIGHT THROUGH PROJECTION MODELS 01CONTENTS\nBackground...............................................................................................................................................................................01\nA modeling framework for Business Insight ....................................................................................................................03\nA case study ............................................................................................................................................................................04\nExample scenarios .................................................................................................................................................................04\nMany scenarios .......................................................................................................................................................................07\nSummary .................................................................................................................................................................................08A modeling framework for Business Insight\nIn this paper, we illustrate the use of models to project IFRS 17 financial statements over time and under different scenarios.\nOne approach to this projection problem is to calculate financial statements in the future in much the same way as they are\ncalculated for reporting today. This approach involves accurately projecting cash flows on individual contracts (or model points) and\nthen aggregating them to calculate IFRS 17 financial metrics at the chosen contract group level. This approach might be considered a\n‘bottom up’ approach, in the sense of modeling cash flows at a relatively granular level and then aggregating.\nIn this paper, we consider implementation of an alternative approach, involving a ‘top down’ modeling framework. This approach\ntakes aggregate (contract group level) cash flows as calculated at ‘time zero’, and adjusts them to reflect the different scenarios under\ninvestigation. The main components of the calculation are shown in the following diagram.\nThe main concept to note here is the ‘agile’ valuation model, which is used to calculate the actual cash flows, expected cash flows\nand their present values, risk adjustments, and coverage units, at each year of the projection. The agile model is an approximate\nmodel that enables these items to be calculated quickly within a projection, without recalculating the cash flows ‘bottom up’ in\nevery scenario. The bottom up cash flow model is used as an input to the process, providing expected cash flows at the start of\nthe projection only. Subsequent revaluations, in each scenario of interest, are carried out by the agile model using these time zero\nexpected cash flows along with information about the scenario (such as mortality rates, which result in changes to the expected cash\nflows, and discount rates that impact on their valuation).\nAfter the cash flows, present values, and risk adjustments are calculated by the agile model, subsequent items required for the IFRS 17\nfinancial statements (such as the CSM, Insurance Service Result, and Insurance Finance Expenses) can be calculated exactly.\nSuch a modeling framework can be used to analyze the effect of different scenarios on projected IFRS 17 financial statements,\nin particular volatility of profit and loss. It can also help to investigate the impact methodology decisions (such as choice of risk\nadjustment methodology, or choice of coverage units).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: GAINING BUSINESS INSIGHT THROUGH PROJECTION MODELS 03A case study This pattern of profit emergence reflects a scenario where there\nare no changes to assumptions (nor discount rates) and actual\nTo illustrate the projection modeling framework, we consider\ncash flows are exactly equal to those expected at inception.\nan IFRS 17 contract group consisting of immediate annuities.

Discount\nfactors are generated using a stochastic interest rate model,\nbased on a risk-free yield curve with an adjustment for an\nilliquidity premium, while actual and expected mortality rates\nare generated using a stochastic mortality model. By using\nstochastic models, we can generate many possible scenarios and\nalso estimate the probability of future events.\n1,000 scenarios for discount curves and mortality rates were\ngenerated over a 50-year horizon. Here we consider a couple of\nparticular scenarios illustrating two different patterns of profit\nThis contract group is profitable at inception: the Present Value emergence.\nof Future Cash Flows plus Risk Adjustment is calculated as\n15,271 compared to total premiums of 16,000 resulting in an\ninitial CSM of 729. The CSM is released over time in proportion\nto the chosen coverage units. This gradual release of CSM, along\nwith the release of the Risk Adjustment, results in the following\npattern of expected underwriting profits:\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: GAINING BUSINESS INSIGHT THROUGH PROJECTION MODELS 04Scenario 1: Contract group remains profitable throughout life with stable Insurance Service Result\nFirst consider a mortality scenario giving rise to relatively stable\ninsurance service result, similar to that expected at inception.\nThe following charts show projected CSM and projected\nInsurance Service Result (attributed to release of the Risk\nAdjustment and CSM1). Profits over the first 10 or so years\nare stable and close to those expected at inception, because\nmortality assumptions do not change significantly during this\nperiod (as indicated by the bottom chart which shows the\nprojected life expectancy of a 65-year old male in this scenario).\nBeyond 10 years, profits are still close to those expected at\ninception but more volatile. This volatility is driven by volatility\nin the release of the CSM, which in turn is driven by variation\nin assumed mortality expectations. For example, there is an\nupward shock to mortality expectations at year 10, with life\nexpectancy of a 65-year old male dropping by around 5 months\nas a result. This results in an increase in the CSM (absorbing the\ncorresponding decrease in the present value of fulfillment cash\nflows as attributed to the change in assumptions). The following\nfew years exhibit further volatility in mortality expectations;\nagain this volatility is absorbed via the mechanism of the\nCSM, resulting in profit and loss being spread out over time.\nImportantly, the cumulative impact of any longevity increases\nis never large enough to eliminate the CSM completely, and\nthis contract group remains profitable (in the sense of having a\npositive CSM) throughout its life.\n1 The difference between actual and expected claims is an additional contribution to the Insurance Service Result, but in this case it is negligible compared\nto the release of the Risk Adjustment and the CSM.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: GAINING BUSINESS INSIGHT THROUGH PROJECTION MODELS 05Scenario 2: Contract group quickly becomes onerous with volatile Insurance Service Result\nIn contrast, now consider a mortality scenario that brings about\na highly volatile insurance service result. In this scenario, there\nare consecutive longevity improvements over the first 3 years\nof projection. While the CSM can absorb some of the impact of\nthese assumption changes, by year 3 it is wiped out completely,\nresulting in a relatively large immediate loss at that point, and\nthe establishment of a Loss Component. Subsequent volatility in\nmortality expectations results in immediate P&L throughout the\nremaining life of the contact group. Once the Loss Component is\nestablished in year 3, it is never fully reversed.\nAnalysis of these two scenarios illustrates just how different\nthe volatility of profit and loss can be, depending on whether\nthe contract group stays profitable (where the CSM serves to\namortize profit and loss) or becomes onerous (where profit and\nloss are immediately realized).\nThe stochastic mortality model used here assumes that\nmortality expectations used in the annuity valuations are\nupdated each year to perfectly reflect ‘true’ underlying mortality\nexpectations. In other words, each year the assumed mortality\nexpectations provide an unbiased (and accurate) forward\nlooking estimate of actual realized mortality rates that year. In\nreality, assumptions are unlikely to be updated as efficiently\nas assumed in this model. It might be argued that the model\noverstates the frequency of changes in assumptions (and\nconversely understates the impact of actuals being different\nfrom expected). Nonetheless, the model provides useful insight\ninto the impact of changing mortality expectations and actual\nmortality rates on IFRS 17 profit and loss. Also, alternative\ncalibrations, models, or ‘hand-picked’ scenarios can easily be\ninvestigated within this framework.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: GAINING BUSINESS INSIGHT THROUGH PROJECTION MODELS 06Many scenarios the previously profitable group becoming onerous for the first\ntime that year, while the line shows the cumulative probability.\nThe scenarios presented in the previous section are just two of\nIn this case, we estimate that there is a 70% chance of this\nmany scenarios that might arise in the future. However, the agile\ncontract group becoming onerous at some point during its\nmodel is fast enough that a large number of scenarios can be\nlifetime, and a 23% chance of becoming onerous over the first 5\ninvestigated. By generating scenarios using a stochastic model,\nyears.\nwe can build up a picture of the distribution of items on the\nfinancial statements.\nFor example, the following charts show the estimated\ndistribution of the CSM and Insurance Service Results, at\neach projection year. Distributions are estimated using 1,000\nstochastic scenarios2.\nIn addition to allowing measurement of such probabilities, the\nprojection model allows the user to measure their sensitivity\nto assumptions. For example, the following chart compares\nthe cumulative probabilities of becoming onerous for three\ndifferent methodologies for calculating the Risk Adjustment:\nthe cost-of-capital method and the VaR method using two\ndifferent confidence levels (85% and 95%)3. As an edge case,\nwe also compare the cumulative probability for the case where\nno Risk Adjustment is assumed. As the initial CSM is effectively\na balancing item, a lower Risk Adjustment brings about a higher\nCSM with greater scope to absorb future losses.\nSince the year-on-year volatility of the Insurance Service\nResult depends strongly on whether the group is profitable or\nonerous, one metric of particular interest is the probability of\nthe contract group becoming onerous in the future. Indeed,\nthe IFRS 17 guidelines for contract grouping include the\ndegree of profitability (at inception and in the future) as a The Risk Adjustment methodology is just one of the many\nkey consideration in the grouping of contracts.

Each bar shows the probability of\n2 Of course, such probabilistic assessments are sensitive to the assumptions of the stochastic scenario generator (in particular here, the stochastic\nmortality model).\n3 For reference, the ‘equivalent’ VaR confidence level for the cost-of-capital approach here is estimated to be 91%. Mortality shocks used to calculate the\nRisk Adjustment are based on the calibration of the Solvency II Longevity Risk module.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 17: GAINING BUSINESS INSIGHT THROUGH PROJECTION MODELS 07Summary\nMany insurance companies are currently focused on implementing systems to support calculation and reporting of IFRS 17 financial\nstatements. These efforts are understandably focused on being able to perform these calculations for published reporting. This paper\nhighlights the importance of being able to not just measure but also to project financial statements to understand their sensitivity\nto market risks, insurance risks, and methodology decisions. We have described the use of a modeling methodology to support such\nanalysis, using a case study based on an IFRS 17 group consisting of annuities. Such analysis provides insight into the effect of IFRS 17\non reported profit and loss, and can help in the immediate decision making required to implement this principles-based standard.\nCONTACT DETAILS\nVisit us at moodysanalytics.com or contact us at a location below.\nAMERICAS EMEA ASIA (EXCLUDING JAPAN) JAPAN\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com clientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\n© 2018 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
