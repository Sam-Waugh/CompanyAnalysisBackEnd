    "content": "Biting The Bullet on Basel\nIt’s now six years since the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published its final\nBasel framework (Basel 3.1 or Final Basel III), and after much consultation the dust has\nsettled.\nSo now it is time to bite the bullet and get on with the job of complying with the rules on\ncredit risk (standardised approach [SA] and/or internal ratings-based approach [IRB]), the\nstandardised approach to operational risk (SA-OR), market risk (fundamental review of the\ntrading book [FRTB} ), credit valuation adjustment [CVA] and so on.\nSimply complying will require a considerable investment in time, money and talent.\nBut some banks are looking beyond “simply comply” and into “turning compliance into\nperformance”. There is a growing acceptance that final Basel III provides a baseline,\na foundation on which to build resilience against financial stress and loss-absorbing\ncapacity.\nThis being the case, firms should now take the opportunity to demonstrate that budgets\nare spent well and deliver a sustainable return on investment. If they don’t, there is a risk\nthat a firm’s senior leadership will lose the competitive advantage of leveraging regulatory\nreporting requirements to increase profitability.\nHere’s what we recommend:\n1. Agree on the approach, get senior management buy in. Explicitly grasp this opportunity to\naddress regulatory compliance while improving profits and competitiveness. Communicate\nthe positive benefits of building a sustainable solution to senior management as well as the\nimperative of avoiding fines and supervisory displeasure.2. Realistically asses the costs. Firms should simultaneously carry out a realistic assessment\nof the cost of compliance. Underestimating it would be a huge error - least of all\nbecause it would put risk and compliance teams under greater (and possibly intolerable)\nstress. Factors that are likely to contribute to the overall costs include: data quality and\nenrichment especially with regards to the standardized approach, the state of the initial set\nup (IRB vs SA); the desired scope (from minimal compliance to performance benefits), size\nand complexity of the institution (multijurisdictions etc), as well as technology costs (see\nbelow)\n3. Remove silos. Risk and regulatory compliance managers should build cross-functional\nteams (including, for example, finance, portfolio managers and treasury) that work within\nthe context of a broader transformation of the business. These teams will be well placed to\nreach conclusions and advise on strategic decisions to revise the business model.\n4. Consider the cost of technology. In calculating the costs, it is likely that project leaders\nwill find data and technology to be the biggest up-front costs, perhaps because most\nof the data is either unavailable or it is in a variety of legacy silo systems. By adopting\nSaaS approach banks can both tackle the big data challenges and get off the treadmill\nof constant regulatory compliance IT projects as the software is immediately updated\nwhenever new regulatory requirements are published. Moody’s Analytics have been\nhelping banks to reap benefits of SaaS deployment of their reg compliance for years and\ncan vouch for the overall value add.\n5. Implement and reap the benefits. With the new streamlined and future-proof solution in\nplace, firms can start to enjoy the business benefits. First, and most obviously, the Basel\ncapital requirements will be correctly calculated avoiding holding excess regulatory\ncapital. Second, firms will have a sustainable basis for more effective management of the\nbusiness, for example through active portfolio management with more granular risk-based\npricing and greater agility in stress-testing.\nIn short, the final Basel deadline is fast approaching. But there is still time to make a\nvirtue of necessity and reap the benefits of investment in a sustainable solution that not\nonly meets regulatory requirements, but also supports the need for the business to be\nrobust, able to identify new opportunities and grow profitably.\nCONTACT US\nFind out more about Basel compliance.\nwww.moodysanalytics.com/BankingCloudCR\nCONTACT DETAILS\nVisit us at moodysanalytics.com or contact us at a location below.\nAMERICAS EMEA ASIA (EXCLUDING JAPAN) JAPAN\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com clientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\n© 2023 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
