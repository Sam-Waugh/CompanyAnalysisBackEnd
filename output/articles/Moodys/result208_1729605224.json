In recent years, progress has been somewhat overshadowed by a series of\nglobal crises that have dominated the world stage. The COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain disruptions, hot\nconflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, the inflation surge, the sharp tightening in monetary policy, and\nescalating climate events have collectively diverted attention—as well as resources—away from the gender\ninequality discourse. Attesting to that, Google Trends data show that the number of searches for terms such\nas “gender inequality”, “gender pay gap”, “unequal pay”, and “female labour force participation” have all\nmore than halved since peaking at the beginning of 2022. Yet despite moving out of the spotlight, progress\non the matter has continued in the background. Especially welcome is the sharp increase in the female\nlabour force participation rate during the last four years as more women have joined or rejoined the labour\nforce (see Chart 1).\nWhile the female participation rate fell at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as countries went into lock-\ndown and many people lost their jobs, the recovery has been swift. Impressively, the female participation\nrate had already risen above its pre-pandemic level in the European Union in 2021 and in the U.S. in 2022.\nProgress in the EU has been especially remarkable, with the female labour force participation rate rising\nalmost 3 percentage points in three years.\nThe labour force participation rate, in this context, is defined as the proportion of the working-age pop-\nulation (age 20 to 64) that is either employed or actively seeking employment. Historically, the share of\nwomen in the labour force has been low, much lower than that of men. This stems from traditional gender\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 2Chart 1: Female Labour Force Participation Has Rebounded Post-Pandemic\nFemale participation rate, age 20-64, %\n75\n74\n73\n72\n71\n70\n69\n17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nEU U.S. EU pre-pandemic U.S. pre-pandemic\nSources: Eurostat, BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nroles, lack of supportive policies such as parental leave or childcare, workplace discrimination, and limited\neducational opportunities, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. For instance,\nin the U.S., the labour force participation rate for women was only about 34% in 1950 compared with\naround 73% today.\nDespite the significant progress made in the past decades in the U.S. and worldwide, the participation\nrate for women remains below the participation rate of 83% for men—which means that there is a gap of\naround 10 percentage points between the percentage of men and women in the U.S. who are either work-\ning or looking for a job. This is what we call the gender labour force participation gap; in other words, it is a\nmeasure that indicates the difference in participation rates between men and women.\nInterestingly enough, the post-pandemic surge in female labour force participation was not mirrored by a\ncomparable increase in the male participation rate, resulting in a further narrowing of the gender partici-\npation gap and supporting the fight against gender inequality. Even more promising is that this has been\na global phenomenon, with significant progress seen not only in the U.S. and Europe, but in most major\ncountries in Asia and Latin America as well (see Chart 2).\nGranted, there are still significant disparities across countries. For example, while the largest post-pandemic\ndeclines in the gender gap have been observed in India and the Philippines, the gender gap in those countries\nremains extremely wide—in India’s case, more than four times the U.S. or the EU. These larger gaps can\noften be traced to traditional gender roles and insufficient supportive policies for women in the workforce.\nEconomies heavily reliant on industries traditionally dominated by men also tend to have larger gaps.\nBy contrast, countries with larger service sectors, which often provide more flexible and part-time work\noptions, tend to have smaller gaps.\nWhy has the gap narrowed?\nProgress in gender equality has been ongoing for several decades, which means that some further narrowing\nof the gender participation gap was to be expected in the past years. However, the post-pandemic decline\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 3Chart 2: Gender Gaps in the Labour Markets Have Narrowed\nPpt difference between male and female labourforce participation rate, all ages\nIndia\nTurkey\nMexico\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\nChile\nArgentina\nBrazil\nS.

We have\nidentified three key forces behind the gains: the very tight labour markets across the globe, the broad-based\nincrease in living costs due to the surge in inflation during the past two years, and working conditions that\nhave become more flexible because of the shift towards remote working.\nFirst, the post-pandemic period has been marked by an unusually tight labour market. Since 2020, the\nunemployment rate has fallen significantly across the globe, including in the U.S., where it has been less\nthan 4% for around two years (see Chart 3). The unemployment rate has not been this persistently low\nsince the late 1960s.\nChart 3: Unemployment Rates Are Near Historic Lows\n%\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n95 97 99 01 03 05 07 09 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\nU.S. U.S. 2023 EU EU 2023 Australia Australia 2023\nSources: BLS, Eurostat, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Moody’s Analytics\n3\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 4Increased competition for workers pushed companies to increase wages and other incentives (benefits such\nas childcare or family leave, or more flexible work arrangements) to attract workers. Consequently, wage\ngrowth soared, and median wage growth was consistently north of 5% on a year-ago basis for the first time\nsince the 1990s. Higher wages and persistent wage growth are natural incentives for new entrants into the\nlabour market.\nWage growth was relatively consistent between men and women in the U.S. However, as male labour force\nparticipation has been on a decline, similar wage pressures allowed women to make progress in closing the\nwage gap. Before the pandemic, the women’s-to-men’s wage ratio had moved little since around 2010.\nSince the pandemic, it has drifted upwards, driven by a notable increase at the top of the earnings spectrum,\nreflecting women’s increased presence in high-paying industries (see Chart 4).\nChart 4: Recent Movement in the Wage Gap Coming From High-Wage Earners\nWomen’s-to-men’s wage ratio, %, 4-qtr MA\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\n95 97 99 01 03 05 07 09 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\nBottom 10% Median Top 10%\nSources: BLS, Moody’s Analytics\n4\nSecond, the past two years witnessed a dramatic escalation in the cost of living across the globe. Supply\nshocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have triggered significant\nincreases in prices of manufactured goods, energy and food, while at the same time bringing about a perfect\nstorm in labour markets resulting in labour shortages across numerous economic sectors. The compounding\neffect of these shocks has significantly amplified global inflation pressures, leading to a deterioration in\ndisposable income (see Chart 5).\nAdding fuel to the fire, central banks were forced to raise interest rates in one of the fastest and most aggres-\nsive global tightening cycles in modern history to tame inflation, further straining household finances.\nThe double whammy of high inflation and high interest rates exerted significant pressure on household\nbudgets. As a result, many families were forced to seek additional income sources, leading to an increasing\nnumber of individuals joining the labour force. Single-income households in particular found it progressively\nchallenging to maintain their living standards, prompting a wave of new entrants, including a significant\nnumber of women, into the workforce.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 5Chart 5: Incomes Have Been Squeezed\nReal disposable income per capita, 2019=100\n106\n104\n102\n100\n98\n96\n94\n92\n19 20 21 22 23\nGermany Japan South Africa U.K.\nSources: Eurostat, Japan Economic and Social Research Institute, United Nations, U.K. Office of National Statistics, Moody’s Analytics\n5\nThird, our view is that the post-pandemic shift towards more flexible work arrangements, especially remote\nworking, has acted as a significant pull factor into the labour market. Firms had to quickly adapt to work-\ning-from-home arrangements at the height of the pandemic. While the removal of mobility restrictions in\n2021 has brought most people back into the workplace, several companies have decided to permanently\nswitch to hybrid or remote work. As of early 2024, around 30% of paid days were worked at home in the\nU.S., compared with less than 10% prior to the pandemic (see Chart 6).\nChart 6: Pandemic Permanently Changed Attitudes Towards Remote Work\nFull days worked at home in U.S., % of paid days\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n03 06 09 12 15 18 20 21 22 23 24\nSources: Barrero, Jose Maria, Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J. Davis, 2021. \"Why working from home will stick,\" National Bureau of Economic Research Working\nPaper 28731, Moody’s Analytics.\nThis move towards more flexible working conditions is expected to have opened doors for some women,\npulling participants into the labour market. Certain age groups are at the forefront of this shift. Women\nbalancing career growth with early family life—the ones represented in the 30-34 age group in Chart 7—\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 6Chart 7: Uneven Participation Gains Across Age Categories\nChange in female participation rate from 2019Q4 to 2023Q3, %\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n20-24 25-54 30-34 55-65 65+\nU.S. EU\nSources: BLS, Eurostat, Moody’s Analytics\ntake centre stage, as working from home has allowed them to hold a job while caring for children. Cru-\ncially, women in this age cohort are likely also facing more acute financial pressures such as dealing with\nchildcare and housing—a further motivation to look for a remote job amidst a cost-of-living crisis.\nBut women in the older cohorts who are potentially approaching retirement, dealing with health concerns,\nor caring for the elderly, may have also found the flexibility and reduced physical demands of remote work\nparticularly appealing. Given the tightness of labour markets, they might also have seen an opportunity to\nseek additional income sources in the face of inadequate retirement savings, especially in Europe.\nIn contrast, for the younger cohort, specifically women age 20 to 24, the sharp increase in labour force\nparticipation in the EU likely owes more to the surge in job opportunities due to labour shortages and low\nunemployment rates, rather than the advent of remote work.\nLooking at the broader picture, while this shift in attitude towards remote work has been observed globally,\nwith large corporations leading the charge in adapting to a different business environment, there is still a\nlot of divergence across countries owing to cultural norms. Zooming in on European countries, we see that\nwhile remote business meetings are conducted by the large majority of companies in the Nordics, they are\nstill not as popular in large countries such as France and Italy (see Chart 8).\nIn France and Italy, less than half of small and medium enterprises conduct online meetings, which speaks\nto women there facing more challenges related to having children or caring for the elderly. Remote work is\nalso less prevalent in Spain and Portugal.\nWill the recent shifts in gender gaps be permanent?\nThere is a strong likelihood that at least some of this narrowing in the gender gap will be enduring, reflecting\nlong-term changes in societal norms, corporate practices and policy environments. However, if push factors\nsuch as high inflation and interest rates dominate, we might witness some backsliding when these economic\npressures ease and household incomes stabilize. Our forecast is for inflation to fall back to target in most\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 7Chart 8: Remote Meetings Have Become Commonplace\n% of enterprises conducting remote meetings via the internet\nDenmark\nFinland\nNorway\nSweden\nIreland\nBelgium\nPortugal\nAustria\nNetherlands\nSpain\nGermany\nItaly\nFrance\nPoland\nTurkey\nRomania\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n250+ employees 10 to 249 employees\nSources: Eurostat, Moody’s Analytics\nmajor countries throughout 2024, while wage growth should remain steady given still-tight labour markets.\nThis will allow purchasing power to recover some lost ground. At the same time, major central banks such\nas the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank should start cutting interest rates during the first\nhalf of this year, bringing further relief to households. In this scenario, the necessity driving some women\ninto the workforce is likely to diminish, potentially reversing some of the recent gains in female labour\nforce participation.\nMoreover, the return-to-office mandates by some companies in the past few months could also contribute to\na potential backslide in female participation rates. Without the flexibility of remote work, many women—\nespecially those with young children—could find themselves having to exit the workforce. The Global Survey\nof Working Arrangements reveals an increasing divergence between employer and employee expectations\nregarding remote work. On average, employees worldwide express a desire to work from home two days\nper week, whereas employers plan for a notably lower average of 1.1 work-from-home days per week.1 This\nhighlights how attitudes towards flexible working arrangements might be changing, potentially to the det-\nriment of women (see Chart 9).\nAnd even if remote work remained an option to some women, notably those with small children, it could\ncome with unintended disadvantages in a larger back-to-the-office context. Anecdotal evidence shows that\nmanagers unintentionally favour employees who are physically present in the office, providing them with\nbetter assignments, higher raises, and more opportunities for promotion.\nA recent study by U.K. Public First has found that hybrid working models have proven to be a significant\ncatalyst in boosting female labour force participation in the U.K. The study showed that women who primar-\nily work from home are considerably more likely to work full time compared with those who mostly work\naway from home, with this trend being even more pronounced in households with dependent children.\nFurthermore, industry data reveal a substantial increase in the proportion of women working full time in\n1 Askoy, C.

This increase is even more significant among those with children.\nIf the opportunities to work from home diminish, this would be a setback to recent gains in full-time\nfemale employment.\nIs the rise in participation matched by a rise in job quality?\nMore and more women are becoming actively engaged in the labour market across the world. But what\nsort of jobs are they heading into? Moody’s Analytics research has shown that women are consistently\noverqualified for their jobs and underutilised in the workforce.2 This is partly responsible for the wide gen-\nder gaps in senior and middle management positions, with these gender gaps growing as you move up the\nseniority ladder. Has the narrowing of gender gaps in participation and changes in the way we work also\nhelped narrow gaps in management?\nThe evidence is mixed but does suggest that women have not just been joining the workforce but have also\nbeen moving into more senior roles within the workforce. Survey evidence for the U.S. shows that the share\nof women in entry-level positions has increased by just 3 percentage points in recent years, compared with\na 6-point rise in the share of women holding vice president-level positions and a whopping 11-point rise in\nthe share of women in C-suite positions, albeit from a very low starting point (see Chart 10).\nIn the EU, the share of female managers had been rising steadily since 2019 but seemed to reverse course\ntowards the end of 2022. This appears to be partly driven by demographics, with the share of female man-\nagers older than 50 continuing the upward trend in 2023. This may be linked to the observation above that\nthe rise in female participation in the EU has been most dramatic in the 55-65 age group. It suggests that\nwomen who have achieved more senior roles in the workforce are choosing to stay attached to the labour\nforce for longer. This has important implications for the individuals involved as well as for government fiscal\npositions in terms of current income tax revenue and future social benefit liabilities (see Chart 11).\n2 https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2023/close-the-gender-gap-to-unlock-productivity-gains.pdf\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 9Chart 10: Gender Gaps Narrowing at the Top in the U.S.\nFemale share of employment by occupation in U.S., %\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\nEntry level Manager Sr. manager/director Vice president Senior vice president C-suite\n2015 2023\nSources: McKinsey & Co., Moody’s Analytics\nChart 11: Demographic Differences in EU Gender Gaps in Management\nShare of female managers in EU, all sectors\n36\n35\n34\n33\n32\n31\n30\n29\n28\n15 17 19 21 23\nAge 20-64 Age 50+\nSources: Eurostat, Moody’s Analytics\n11\nElsewhere in the world, many other countries have also seen gender gaps in management narrow since\n2019. For example, in Asia, the International Labour Organization estimates that the proportion of\nwomen in senior and middle management positions has increased by more than 2 points in Vietnam,\nPhilippines and Indonesia; in Latin America there has been a significant rise in female managers in Argen-\ntina, Colombia and Mexico; and elsewhere, gender management gaps in both Turkey and South Africa\nhave also narrowed.\nNew female labour market entrants are landing in jobs in a range of sectors, narrowing gender gaps in industries\nthat have traditionally been heavily male-dominated, such as utilities and construction in particular. Women now\nmake up around 27% of utilities employees in the U.S. In the past few years, utilities employment has surged\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 10overall and is now at levels not seen for around 20 years—and women’s employment in the industry has been\ngrowing even faster. A similar phenomenon is evident in the EU, where employment in utilities has increased by\nmore than 10% since 2019 compared with an overall rise in employment of closer to 2% (see Chart 12).\nChart 12: Gains in Employment Share Have Varied Across Industries\nPpt change in female share of employment since 2019Q4\nUtilities\nConstruction\nInformation\nTransportation and warehousing\nProfessional services\nFinance activities\n-1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\nU.S. EU\nSources: BLS, Eurostat, Moody’s Analytics\n12\nThe financial sector has seen a drop-off in the share of female employment. This sector is actually already\ndominated by women, who account for more than 50% of finance employment in the U.S. and the EU. But\ncritically, women remain underrepresented in more senior positions, accounting for just over 35% of financial\nsector managers in the EU. While the female share of total employment in finance has declined since 2019,\nmore women have moved into senior roles, with a small narrowing of the gender gap in management\nduring the same period. Gender management gaps have also narrowed in construction, ICT, and human\nhealth industries (see Chart 13).\nEvidence from the U.K. also points towards an improvement in job quality for women in finance, with a\nsignificant increase in the share of women in the financial sector working full time from 2019 to 2023. Surveys\nsuggest that this is linked to greater flexibility at the workplace and the shift to hybrid work (see Chart 14).\nEveryone benefits from a decline in gender inequality\nNarrowing gender gaps in labour force participation mean there are more people active in the workforce\nthan there would have been if gender gaps remained unchanged. Simply put, more people actively work-\ning means that the global economy can produce more. To estimate the magnitude of that impact on\nglobal income, we use the Moody’s Analytics global macroeconomic model to develop a counterfactual\nscenario where female labour force participation rose at the same rate as male labour force participation\nfrom 2019 to 2023, leaving the gender gap in participation unchanged. The shock is calibrated for 39 of\nthe world’s largest economies, all of which have seen gender gaps in labour force participation narrow\nsince 2019.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 11Chart 13: Management Gender Gaps Narrowing in Key EU Sectors\nPpt change in female employment share by occupation and sector in EU, 2019Q4-2023Q3\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\nManagers Professionals Technicians Clerical\n-2\nSources: Eurostat, Moody’s Analytics\nChart 14: More Women in Finance Are Working Full Time\nPpt change in share of women working full time since 2019, U.K.\nFinancial and insurance activities\nTransport and storage\nArts, entertainment and recreation\nInformation and communication\nConstruction\nProf, scientific, technical activ.\nAdmin and support services\nPublic admin and defence\nOther service activities\nWholesale, retail, repair of vehicles\nEducation\nHealth and social work\nManufacturing\nAccommodation and food services\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10\nSources: Public First, Commission on Hybrid and Remote Work, Moody’s Analytics\n14\nOur analysis indicates that narrowing gender gaps in labour force participation since 2019 have added\naround $1.5 trillion to global income. Of this, nearly half can be attributed to India and Japan, two large\neconomies where gender gaps remain wide. The income generated from new entrants into the labour\nmarket benefits not only the individuals who are compensated for their work, but also the firms that are\nable to increase production, the governments that receive more in income tax revenue and may also pay\nless in income support, and the world economy overall through the second-round effects on demand\n(see Chart 15).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 12Chart 15: Narrowing Gender Gaps Have Added $1.5 Trillion to Global Income\nContribution to global income, $ bilinternational (purchasing power parity)\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nConclusion\nThere is still enormous work that must be done to achieve gender parity in the labour market. At this stage,\nreaching the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal for gender equality by 2030 is clearly beyond reach.\nNonetheless, small steps have been achieved that are also helping deliver higher economic prosperity\nacross the globe. A silver lining of the havoc wreaked by the COVID-19 pandemic may be a permanent\nshift in attitudes towards working that paves the way for more women to actively engage with the labour\nmarket. However, job quality is at least as important as job quantity. Accelerating the pace in which gender\ngaps in full-time, senior-level positions are narrowing will unlock economic potential at individual and mac-\nroeconomic levels.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS NARROWING THE GENDER PARTICIPATION GAP 13About the Authors\nElise Burton is an associate economist at Moody’s Analytics.
