It’s no secret that\nconcentration risk can lead to significant losses in times of economic volatility because of correlated credit\ndeterioration and defaults. This implies that these assets are not only correlated with the economy as a\nwhole, but also with each other, resulting in higher risk of concentration and losses in times of stress.\nManaging the concentration risk of a credit portfolio is an important component of a sound risk management\nprocess. One of the findings of our analysis shows that you can achieve a capital relief of 21% when you\nremove concentration impact. This equates to a 21% probability of reducing the overall risk of the portfolio by\nmanaging concentration risk. The quantification of concentration risk can help portfolio managers incorporate\nconcentration impact into the risk-return profile of the individual assets of various segments and design\nportfolio strategies in line with the risk appetite framework. A certain amount of concentration risk is\ninevitable for any credit portfolio but can be proactively assessed and managed to maximize the risk-return\nratio.\nThis paper discusses:\n1. What is concentration risk?\n2.How can you quantify the impact of concentration risk?\n3.How can you utilize it for better strategic decisions?1. What is concentration risk?\nConcentration risk is the risk of loss resulting from a significant concentration of exposures, particularly with\nrespect to a single entity or a single group of economically related entities, or with respect to a group of\nentities where the probability of their default depends on a common risk factor.\nThe impact of such common risk factors can result in substantial losses to a segment of a credit portfolio.\nThe Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) highlights in the Comptroller’s Handbook that excessive\nconcentrations of credit have been key factors in banking crises and failures1. The impact of risk\nconcentrations is also integrated in the ICAAP process where institutions should be able to identify and\nassess concentrations that may arise from similar exposure across different regions, industries, business\nlines, etc. This will also help inform the sources and benefits of diversification in the ICAAP.\nThe concentration for a credit portfolio arises primarily from two types of imperfect diversification: name\nconcentration and sector concentration.\n» Name concentration relates to imperfect diversification of idiosyncratic risk in the portfolio, either because\nof its small size or because of large exposures to specific individual obligors.\n» Segment concentration relates to imperfect diversification across systematic components of risk, namely\ngeography and industry factors.\nMaterial exposures to a few large names in the portfolio such as Enron and WorldCom led to a financial crisis\nfor banks in the US in the early 2000s. High concentrations in certain sectors such as airlines and hotels led to\nsubstantial losses during the pandemic for financial institutions with high concentration in those sectors.\nPortfolio-level risk assessment is critical to risk management and risk-return analysis as it accounts for both\nstandalone credit risk of individual assets and the correlations of those assets to provide a true enterprise-\nlevel view of credit risk. Employing a correlation framework such as Moody’s GCORR, which is an extensive\ninter- and intra-asset class correlation model, you can incorporate granular and reliable correlations into the\nportfolio credit risk assessment to capture the additional risk coming from name and sector concentrations.\nBasel II and Basel III also recognize the importance of correlations and concentration by requiring that banks\nwith different levels of concentration risk should have different levels of capital and cover concentration\nrisk explicitly under the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). Once concentration risk\nis captured in the overall portfolio risk metrics, the next step is to understand what is driving the name or\nsegment concentration and the magnitude of the impact to manage and reduce concentration risk through\nportfolio strategies.\n2. How can you quantify the impact of concentration risk?\nWhen correlations are employed in portfolio credit risk assessment, the risk of an individual asset is captured\nthrough systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk:\n» Systematic risk is the risk in common with other firms due to the state of the economy and is\nundiversifiable.\n» Idiosyncratic risk is the net of the systematic risk or firm-specific risk that is diversifiable.\n1 See “Concentrations of Credit” Version 2.0 October 2020 by OCC https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/\nfiles/concentrations-of-credit/pub-ch-concentrations.pdf\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CAN YOU QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF NAME OR SEGMENT CONCENTRATION ON YOUR PORTFOLIO? CONTACT USTwo firms with the same systematic risk will be affected to the same extent by an external shock, whereas\ntheir idiosyncratic risk will always be unique to each firm. In Moody’s GCORR framework, systematic risk is\ndefined by geography, industry, or property type.\nName concentration arises when a portfolio contains large, single-name exposure where returns on individual\nexposures are more heavily correlated. In a portfolio where 10% of the total exposure is attributed to a\nsingle name, a large shock to this name could lead to at least 10% of the portfolio being affected. The key to\nquantifying name concentration is identifying the firm-specific or idiosyncratic risk. If the large, single name is\nbroken up into smaller and less concentrated names with the same risk profiles and the same systematic risk\nexposure, they will have the same systematic risk but may not default all at once due to each name’s unique\nidiosyncratic shocks. This reduces the probability of large losses below that of having one large name with\nthe same total exposure amount. If the collection of these names continues to be broken into an infinitely\ngranular portfolio, the idiosyncratic component is eventually fully diversified. This is how name concentration\nis quantified by comparing portfolio risk with the full idiosyncratic risk of individual names and without\nidiosyncratic risk, while maintaining the same level of systematic risk.\nAs with name concentration, a high exposure to one sector or one geography could also lead to extreme\nlosses if there is a shock to the segment. Once the name concentration is removed, the segment\nconcentration can be assessed and quantified. Each segment’s concentration risk can be reassessed by\nremoving the segment (i.e., industry or geography), and the new portfolio risk is compared to the original\nportfolio risk without name concentration to quantify the incremental impact of each segment’s\nconcentration risk.\nCase Study\nThree portfolios, A, B, and C are constructed to have the same total dollar exposures. Both A and B have ten\nunique industries, where Portfolio B has the dollar exposure more equally distributed across the industries.\nFigure 1 Portfolio Composition\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CAN YOU QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF NAME OR SEGMENT CONCENTRATION ON YOUR PORTFOLIO? CONTACT USPortfolio C contains 25 equally weighted industries.\nLeveraging the framework discussed above, the name and segment concentrations can be decomposed for\neach portfolio. The name concentration is assessed first, and each segment is quantified afterwards.\nFigure 2 Name and Industry Concentration Analysis\nKey findings here are:\n» Despite the same total exposure amount, Portfolio A has the highest portfolio risk or tail risk (i.e., economic\ncapital) due to its high name and segment concentration. Portfolio A also has the highest name and\nsegment concentration levels compared to Portfolio B and C.\n» Portfolio B is smaller than Portfolio A, despite having the same number of industries. It also has a more\nequal distribution of the exposure amount across the names and thus a smaller level of name concentration.\n» The total portfolio risk of Portfolio C is the smallest, as both segment and name concentrations are much\nsmaller. There are more industries and less dollar concentration for each name.\nThis case study demonstrates the importance of concentration management and diversification not only to\nreduce the portfolio risk, but also the name or segment concentration.\n3. How can you utilize the concentration analysis?\nThe same framework can be applied to quantify the concentration risk for each name and each segment. This\ncan be leveraged for various use cases.\n» Regulatory needs\nConcentration is one of the focus areas for regulators around the world. Due to the standardized nature of the\nregulatory capital, regulators emphasize each bank’s responsibility to measure, monitor, and control its credit\nrisk concentrations explicitly with respect to capital adequacy under Pillar 22.\n2See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Supervisory review process, SRP32, 15 Dec 2019\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CAN YOU QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF NAME OR SEGMENT CONCENTRATION ON YOUR PORTFOLIO? CONTACT USNotable regulators such as the EBA, ECA, OSFI, OCC, etc. expect financial institutions to implement\nappropriate methodologies and practices in line with their risk policy to aggregate the credit risk in portfolios,\nsegments, business lines or names for credit risk concentration.\n» Business needs\nThis exercise allows portfolio managers to better understand which name or which segment has the highest\nincremental risk impact on the portfolio even if the names or segments have the same risk profile. Depending\non the size and the level of correlations, each name and segment can have different levels of concentration\nrisk. This will then help portfolio managers make strategic decisions as to which name or segment exposures\ncould be added to be most beneficial to the portfolio. By identifying the highest diversification benefit or worst\nconcentration risk, you can effectively manage risk and in due course improve the risk-return ratio. Looking\nat the portfolio before and after the name concentration, you can see less variability in the risk-return across\nexposures while the risk-return ratio (described as Vasicek or VR ratio) also increases for the portfolio.\nFigure 3 Profitability after Name Concentration\nWhat is next?\nName or segment concentration analysis can help not only with regulatory needs but also business needs by\nmanaging the credit for the institution. It also enables institutions to plan portfolio strategies in line with their\nrisk appetite. Moody’s GCORR framework integrates comprehensive correlations across names and segments\nand identifies the impact of name and segment concentration on a credit portfolio.
