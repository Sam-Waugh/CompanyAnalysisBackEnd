The top down approach requires an insurer to build a curve based on their actual asset\nportfolio or a reference portfolio and then adjust the yield on this portfolio by deducting an allowance for credit risk. The insurer\nalso needs to adjust the yield to account for any mismatch between asset and liability cash flows. Credit risk within this approach\ncan further be decomposed into a compensation for expected losses (real world default risk) and a specific credit risk premium,\nwhich reflects the uncertainty around expected losses.\nThe bottom up approach requires an insurer to choose financial instruments to reflect the (liquid) risk free rate and then to fit a\ncurve to those data and then determine an appropriate liability specific illiquidity premium to be applied above the risk free curve.\nWhilst in principle both approaches should give the same results, section B84 of the IFRS 17 standard acknowledges that the top\ndown and bottom up calculations may give different answers in practice and do not need to exactly reconcile.\nFigure 1 Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches to IFRS 17 Discount Curve Construction\nThere are related, but distinct, challenges to both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down the primary questions relate to\nestimating the credit risk premium and the selection of an appropriate reference portfolio. Bottom-up the standard states that the\nilliquidity premium applied must reflect the liquidity characteristics of the insurance product being valued, determining the\nappropriate liquidity characteristics and mapping these to asset data where the illiquidity premium can be estimated is a key task\nfor this approach. The liquid risk-free rate also needs to be defined for a bottom-up approach, we discuss this point in more detail\non page 6.\nMethodology overview\nWithin this report we follow the top-down structural method defined in our previous white paper Thompson and Jessop (2018) to\ncalculate the credit risk premium and to decompose market spreads into three components: 1) expected losses from defaults 2)\nUnexpected losses (credit risk premium) and 3) illiquidity premium. The derived illiquidity premia are then presented in a form\nwhere they could be applied bottom-up.\nOur method uses a Merton-style structural model of credit risk to calculate fair value spreads based on a combination of real\nworld probabilities of default, estimated at an individual firm level, sectoral estimates of loss given default and a weighted cost-of-\ncapital adjustment for credit risk premium. This method leverages Moody’s Analytics CreditEdge™ expected default frequency\n(EDF™) model of real world probability of default. CreditEdge EDFs are an industry recognized standard for point-in-time\nprobability of default, please refer to Nazeran and Dwyer (2015) for more detail of the EDF model.\nThe forward looking nature of the EDF estimates is well aligned to recent developments in the IFRS standards, in particular the IFRS\n9 impairment methodologies which were introduced as a response to ‘too little too late’ during the financial crisis (Zhang, 2018).\nEDFs are procyclical estimates of credit risk, and will also drive a proportionately procyclical estimate of the credit risk premia using\nour method. This means that all three components of spread changes (expected losses, credit risk premium and illiquidity premia)\nare all expected to be positively correlated with market spread changes when using the method outlined. Understanding and being\nable to provide robust justification for this aspect of the IFRS 17 yield curve calibrations is likely to be a critical component of a\nsuccessful and acceptable implementation of the standards.\n3 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nMethodology Considerations\nCredit risk adjustment\nIn brief, the structural model of credit risk employed in our method calculates a firm’s credit risk by treating the traded equity of\nthe firm as a call option on the firm’s assets, with a strike price given by the default point, where the firm’s assets cannot cover its\nliabilities. By modelling the value of the firm’s assets with a stochastic process, a geometric Brownian motion, the real-world\nprobability of default can be calculated at a given horizon, dependent on the leverage or the firm, the expected return on the\nfirm’s assets and the asset volatility. The final real world probability of default is calculated using an empirical mapping based on a\ndatabase of historical defaults.\nMathematically, the compensation for expected credit losses is given by combining the real world probability of default with the\nrecovery rate, or loss given default:\n1\nwhere is the duration matc𝐸𝐸h𝐸𝐸e𝐸𝐸d𝐸𝐸 c𝐸𝐸u𝐸𝐸m𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸ul a𝐶𝐶t𝐶𝐶iv𝐸𝐸e𝐸𝐸 p𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸ro 𝐿𝐿b𝐿𝐿a𝐿𝐿b𝐿𝐿il i𝑆𝑆ty𝐸𝐸 𝐶𝐶o𝐸𝐸f 𝑆𝑆de𝐸𝐸f𝑖𝑖 a=ult −for\n𝑇𝑇\na𝑖𝑖 lgniv(1en− bo𝐶𝐶n𝐶𝐶d𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖 a⋅n𝐿𝐿d𝐿𝐿 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖), is the loss given default for\nthat issuer’s industrial sector, a parameter also derived from CreditEdge.\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 𝐶𝐶 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖\nThe unexpected loss is then calculated by adjusting the real world probability of default to account for a credit risk premium. This\ncredit risk premium is calculated based on a cost-of-capital approach, assuming that the expected return on a firm’s assets is\nrelated to the leverage weighted cost of capital for that firm. We say the cost of capital is given by\nwhere the cost of debt is derived from the corporate bond spread and the cost of equity is the equity risk premium.\n𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶 =𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸⋅𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 𝐷𝐷𝐸𝐸𝐷𝐷𝐸𝐸+(1−𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸)⋅𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸,\nThe cost of capital is estimated at a portfolio level, where we can more easily determine an average equity risk premium, and then\nscaled using a portfolio beta to get the credit risk premium for a given issuer. The portfolio betas are estimated using the market\nimplied returns for the overall portfolio and each individual issuer.\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑜𝑜𝐿𝐿𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿 𝑊𝑊𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿ℎ𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶⋅\nThe total credit adjustme 𝐼𝐼𝐿𝐿n 𝐿𝐿t 𝐸𝐸is\n𝐸𝐸\nt 𝐶𝐶h 𝑀𝑀en\n𝑆𝑆\nt 𝐶𝐶h 𝑅𝑅e\n𝐸𝐸\ns 𝐸𝐸u m\n𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑃\no 𝐸𝐸f\n𝐶𝐶\nt 𝐶𝐶h 𝐸𝐸e\n𝐸𝐸\ne 𝑅𝑅x 𝐸𝐸p 𝐸𝐸e 𝐸𝐸ct 𝐶𝐶e 𝑛𝑛d𝑖𝑖 c=redit\n𝐶𝐶\nlo 𝐿𝐿s 𝐶𝐶s\n𝐸𝐸\n𝑜𝑜sp 𝐿𝐿r 𝐶𝐶e 𝐶𝐶a 𝐿𝐿d\n𝑀𝑀\nan 𝑆𝑆d\n𝐶𝐶\n𝑅𝑅th 𝐸𝐸e\n𝐸𝐸\nu 𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑃ne 𝐸𝐸xp 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶e 𝐸𝐸c 𝐸𝐸te 𝑅𝑅d\n𝐸𝐸\nc 𝐸𝐸r 𝐸𝐸ed 𝐶𝐶i 𝑛𝑛t loss due to the credit risk\npremium.\nBy defining the observed market spread as the sum of expected loss, unexpected loss and illiquidity premium, the implied\nilliquidity premium can then be backed out as the residual of the market spread minus the total credit adjustment\nRATING AND SECTOR BR𝐼𝐼E𝐶𝐶A𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶K𝐸𝐸D𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶O𝐸𝐸W𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸N 𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 =𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖−𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸 𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝑛𝑛𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖.\nWithin each economy we break down the estimate of the credit risk premium and the implied illiquidity premium for each bond\nrating for which there is sufficient data and across ratings between financial and non-financial issuers. As the leverage and volatility\ncharacteristics of firms vary significantly between sectors our cost-of-capital adjustment should also vary between these\ncategories. To do this we follow the method described in Thompson and Jessop (2018) to adjust the equity risk premium assuming\na constant asset price of risk. The market implied returns indicate that this is a more reasonable quantity to hold constant as\nleverage and volatility change than the equity risk premium itself and the results quoted in this report are more intuitive when this\nadjustment is performed.\nReference Portfolio Construction\nAs a principles based approach, IFRS 17 allows firms freedom to choose reference portfolios aligned to their own business lines and\nproducts. In theory insurers could choose to set a distinct reference portfolio for each line of business or separate product type,\nreflecting the difference in liquidity characteristics between each liability. Alternatively insurers may wish to use a single reference\nportfolio and scale top-down curves or illiquidity premia derived from it as appropriate to each liability.\nThe composition of the reference portfolio will be crucial and there does not yet appear to be consensus in the industry on how\nthis should be constructed, or on whether the portfolio should represent the actual assets used to back the relevant liabilities.\n4 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nSome insurers (particularly the UK bulk annuity players) will be looking to derive a discount rate curve which, at least partially,\nreflects an illiquid asset portfolio. Much of the analysis on illiquidity premia, including within this report, relates to corporate\nbonds. Extending this to illiquid assets such as infrastructure debt or real estate loans increases the challenge. Moody’s Analytics\nare looking at ways to leverage the credit expertise and data which exists within the company to assist with this task. This is likely\nto be a more significant issue where an insurer has chosen to use their actual assets as the reference portfolio.\nThe choice of reference portfolio is not only a concern for a top-down approach to discount curve construction, however, even for\nbottom-up insurers need to understand the liquidity characteristics of liability contacts and resolve how to transfer an illiquidity\npremia derived for a portfolio of assets to a set of insurance contracts. An obvious starting point for many insurers may be the old\nQIS5 “bucketing” approach, where for example annuities were allocated 100% of the premium, with-profits 75% and unit-linked\n50%. A more sophisticated approach may be to examine the underlying liability cashflows and quantify their predictability,\nthereby determining how much of the illiquidity premium on the backing assets could realistically be earned by holding assets to\nmaturity. In either case, the choice of backing assets is still key: it is no use to know that the liabilities should apply 75% of the\npremium on the assets without knowing to which assets this refers.\nExtrapolation and Interpolation\nWithin the standard for IFRS 17 the method for interpolating and extrapolating market data is not specified, though the standard\ndoes require that all appropriate and relevant market data are included. That, however, cannot be our only guiding principle.\nWhen performing our standard Scenario Generator calibrations there are a number of core principles we value in constructing\nappropriate yield curves:\n1) Accuracy: liquid markets should be accurately priced\n2) Continuity: the forward curve should be continuous.\n3) Smoothness: the forward curve should be smooth, i.e. the first derivative should be continuous.\n4) Neutrality where data is missing: avoid extrapolating or interpolating spurious features or views (such as oscillations,\nhumps, or bumps).\nAs in the IFRS 17 standard we first need to ensure that relevant market data are accurately priced, but to that we also add\nconsiderations that the calibrated curves should be continuous, smooth and without spurious variation.\nMoody’s Analytics standard calibrations use a cubic spline Nelson-Siegel (CSNS) algorithm to interpolate and extrapolate market\ndata. This method proceeds by selecting a set of knot points, optimising forward rates at these knot points to satisfy an objective\nfunction and finally matching gradients at the last knot point to extrapolate to a specified ultimate forward rate (UFR) using a\nNelson-Siegel form.\nIn order to follow our third and fourth core principles several penalty terms are added to the objective function, which control the\nfinal gradient of the forward rate curve and the smoothness of the first and second gradients. As standard the number of knot\npoints scales with the square root of the number of fitting data, but caps at 12.\nWhen fitting to corporate bond data, instead of swap rates or government bonds, the calibration is more challenging: due to\ndifferences in credit risk corporate bonds display far more variation in yields to maturity then the equivalent risk free instruments.\nIn order to achieve smoother and more neutral fitted curves, the calibrations in this report relax the constraint on the number of\nknot points but also increase the second derivative smoothing penalty compared to our standard calibrations. Figure 2 shows a\ncomparison of the two calibration parameter sets for GBP investment grade corporate bonds at end December 2018. Where\nmarket data is relatively sparser, generally at longer maturities, calibrated yield curves can be sensitive to individual points and if\nknot points are spaced too widely can produce unintuitive forward rate curves. Note that whilst the forward rates are noticeably\ndifferent between calibrations, the model yields are very similar.\n5 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nFigure 2 Alternative Calibrations for GBP Corporate Bonds at End Dec 2018\n(Left) Forward Rates, Knot Points Marked with Circles.

Some firms\nmay wish to use the Smith-Wilson method. This method is not well suited to fitting to large sets of data with substantial variation,\ni.e. to raw corporate bonds as used in this report, however, firms could first smooth corporate bond yields with a cubic spline, and\nthen fit the final curve and extrapolation using Smith-Wilson. Other firms may wish to simply extrapolate using constant forward\nrates without setting an explicit UFR target; this avoids the need to set an assumption for unconditional illiquidity premia, but may\nresult in less stable long term curves. In this report we use Nelson-Siegel extrapolated to our standard swap UFR for all calibrations\nbut report only the first 30 years.\nRisk-Free Basis\nFor any IFRS 17 discount rate methodology which follows the bottom-up approach, the choice of risk-free basis is essential. Within\nour top-down approach to calculating credit risk premia, however, the choice of risk-free rate can also impact the final results. The\ntotal credit risk adjustment is weakly dependent on the choice of risk-free rate through a change in spread component of the cost-\nof-capital. By changing the underlying basis the spread level, and hence the credit risk premium, or unexpected loss adjustment,\nwill vary.\nFor some economies there is a significant difference between the swap and government curves. Figure 3 shows the difference\nbetween Moody’s Analytics standard SG calibration for Germany at end December 2018, alongside the official EIOPA Solvency II\ncurve at the same date. In periods of market stress this can become even more pronounced; Figure 4 shows the one year LIBOR\nspread for Germany, UK and US from 1997 to 2017.\nIn principle, the “risk-free” curve may need adjustment itself. Either swap contracts or government bonds could in practice contain\nsome illiquidity premia over a fully liquid risk-free rate. Both LIBOR and treasury rates could be adjusted to account for residual\ncredit risk, for example using interbank-OIS spread data, or CDS spreads. Directly using OIS swap data might provide the most\nrobust estimate of a truly risk-free yield curve.\n6 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nFigure 3 Government and Swap Spot Rates for Germany at End Dec 2018\nDEM GOVT SWAP SII\n3.5%\n3.0%\n2.5%\n2.0%\n1.5%\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\n-0.5%\n-1.0%\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60\nFigure 4 One Year Swap Spread For Selected Economies\nGerman Short UK Short US Short\n2.0%\n1.5%\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\n-0.5%\n-1.0%\n-1.5%\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nWithin this report we have used unadjusted government rates as the reference liquid risk-free rates against which to define the\nimplied illiquidity premia. Whilst insurers wishing to align their IFRS 17 balance sheet with Solvency II may wish to start from swap\nrates, doing so would require understanding the current swap spreads and performing appropriate adjustments to understand the\ndecomposition of that spread otherwise unintuitive results for the corporate bond decomposition could be produced.\n7 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nResults\nEUR\nTop-down credit risk adjusted yield curves are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 firstly for a composite portfolio of 1585 investment\ngrade corporate bonds and secondly split by rating. In Figure 5 the fit to the raw yields is shown alongside the fitted yield curves\nproduced after adjusting the yield to maturity on each bond for the expected credit loss and after removing the credit risk\npremium. The CRP adjusted curve represents the top-down curve for that portfolio. For reference Moody’s Analytics standard\ncalibration for German government bonds is also shown. Figure 6 shows the fitted yield curve for portfolios of AA, A and BBB rated\ncorporate bonds using both the raw market yields (solid lines) and after removing credit risk (dotted lines), the latter represent the\ntop down curves for those portfolios. Average characteristics of the bonds, by rating, are presented in Table 1.\nImplied illiquidity premia per rating class can be derived by calculating the spread of the top-down curves over the government\ncurve: these are presented in Figure 7. Average illiquidity premia per rating and maturity bucket are presented in Table 2. Figure 8\nshows a regression of the excess spread, defined as the market spread at end Dec18 minus the expected credit loss, versus the\nimplied illiquidity premia for each bond, this regression allows us to derive an average relationship between spreads and illiquidity\npremia, these proxy coefficients are listed in Table 3. These numbers could be compared to Solvency II where EIOPA define the VA\nas 65% of the credit-adjusted spread (referred to as the fundamental spread).\nFinally data are split into financial and non-financial categories. Figure 9 shows the unadjusted (solid) and credit adjusted (dotted)\ntop-down yield curves for each category. Figure 10 displays the implied illiquidity premia for each category. Table 4 presents the\naverage implied illiquidity premia per category and maturity bucket. Although the unadjusted market yields are similar for both\nfinancial and non-financial corporate bonds, there is a significant difference in the implied illiquidity premia.\nFinancial bonds have a significantly higher probability of default and expected loss than non-financial bonds (an average of 37 bp\nfor financials to 17 bp for non-financial corporate bonds), this is consistent with the EIOPA VA and MA calculations where financial\nbonds generally have higher fundamental spreads. Driving this change, Figure 12 shows that financial issuers have higher leverage\nand lower asset volatility than non-financial issuers, these factors affect both the EDF and the credit risk premium. Table 1 also\nshows that financial issuers have a higher average credit rating, and the analysis per rating shows that a higher rating leads to\nlower illiquidity premia.\nData in all figures and tables are quoted as percentages except where stated otherwise.\nTable 1 EUR Bond Characteristics\nRATING NUMBER OF BONDS AVERAGE YIELD TO AVERAGE DURATION FINANCIAL\nMATURITY PROPORTION\nAll bonds 1585 1.08 % 4.80 25%\nAAA 7 0.88 % 7.77 0\nAA 163 0.57 % 4.45 57%\nA 581 0.89 % 5.05 31%\nBBB 834 1.31 % 4.67 15%\nTOP-DOWN YIELD CURVES\nFigure 5 Credit Risk Adjusted Yield Curves Figure 6 Credit Risk Adjusted Yield Curves\nEUR End Dec 2018 – All Investment Grade Bonds EUR End Dec 2018\n8 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nILLIQUIDITY PREMIA\nFigure 7 Implied Illiquidity Premia Figure 8 Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread\nEUR End Dec 2018 EUR End Dec 2018\nTable 2 Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY -> 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\n/RATING\nAAA 3 15 42 53\nAA 10 10 15 19\nA 26 31 40 52\nBBB 55 66 93 117\nAll Bonds 41 46 67 81\nTable 3 Illiquidity Premia Proxy Coefficients1\nMATURITY -> AVERAGE EXPECTED IP PROPORTION\n/RATING LOSS SPREAD (BP)\nAAA 4.3 0.56\nAA 24.1 0.20\nA 22.1 0.38\nBBB 22.4 0.60\nAll Bonds 22.4 0.51\n1 Coefficients should be interpreted as the intercept and slope, e.g. for EUR all bonds:\n𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶=0.51∗( 𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸−22.4 𝐷𝐷𝐸𝐸)\n9 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nSECTORAL ANALYSIS\nFigure 9 Financial and Non-Financial Yield Curves Figure 10 Financial and Non-Financial Implied Illiquidity Premia\nEUR End Dec 2018 EUR End Dec 2018\nFigure 11 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread Figure 12 Financial and Non-Financial Leverage\nEUR End Dec 2018 EUR End Dec 2018\nTable 4 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY -> 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\n/SECTOR\nNon-Financial 44 51 74 87\nFinancial 27 31 40 42\nAll Bonds 41 46 67 81\n10 MAY 2019 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nGBP\nTop-down credit risk adjusted yield curves are shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14, firstly for a composite portfolio of 413 investment\ngrade corporate bonds and secondly split by rating.

Although the unadjusted market yields are\nsimilar for both financial and non-financial corporate bonds, there is a significant difference in the implied illiquidity premia. Unlike\nother economies in this report HKD financial bonds have a higher illiquidity premia than non-financial bonds.\nFinancial bonds have a slightly lower probability of default and expected loss than non-financial bonds (an average of 27 bp to 35\nbp), this is in contrast to other economies examined here. Despite this difference, Figure 50 shows that as across other economies,\nfinancial issuers have higher leverage and lower asset volatility than non-financial issuers, these factors affect both the EDF and the\ncredit risk premium. Implied illiquidity premia, in particular for non-financial bonds, show a downward trend with maturity. This is\nlikely driven by the limited availability of government bond data and the early point at which extrapolation begins: HK government\nbond data in Moody’s Analytics standard calibrations ends around 10 years, while corporate bond data extends to 30 years. The\nlow, or negative, implied illiquidity premia are perhaps an indication that the risk-free curve extrapolates towards the UFR too\nquickly.\nTable 21 HKD Bond Characteristics\nRATING NUMBER OF BONDS AVERAGE YIELD TO AVERAGE DURATION FINANCIAL\nMATURITY PROPORTION\nAll bonds 395 3.07% 4.34 55%\nTOP-DOWN YIELD CURVES\nFigure 44 Credit Risk Adjusted Yield Curves\nHKD End Dec 2018\n23 DECEMBER 2018 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nILLIQUIDITY PREMIA\nFigure 45 Implied Illiquidity Premia Figure 46 Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread\nHKD End Dec 2018 HKD End Dec 2018\nTable 22 Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\nAll Bonds 27 27 24 26\nTable 23 Illiquidity Premia Proxy Coefficients\nMATURITY AVERAGE EXPECTED IP PROPORTION\nLOSS SPREAD (BP)\nAll Bonds 29.7 0.31\n24 DECEMBER 2018 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nSECTORAL ANALYSIS\nFigure 47 Financial and Non-Financial Yield Curves Figure 48 Financial and Non-Financial Implied Illiquidity Premia\nHKD End Dec 2018 HKD End Dec 2018\nFigure 49 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread Figure 50 Financial and Non-Financial Leverage\nHKD End Dec 2018 HKD End Dec 2018\nTable 24 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY -> 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\n/SECTOR\nNon-Financial 15 17 11 11\nFinancial 38 33 31 32\nAll Bonds 27 27 24 26\n25 DECEMBER 2018 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nConclusion\nThe results presented in this report are an attempt to provide a market data driven, structural approach to determining\nappropriate components for either a top-down or bottom-up approach to constructing discount curves for use under IFRS 17. The\nmodelling leverages Moody’s Analytics substantial experience in expected credit loss modelling alongside standard accounting\ntechniques to determine a cost-of-capital adjustment for credit risk premia.\nThe IFRS 17 standard states that discount curves, whether produced bottom-up or top-down, should relate to the liquidity\ncharacteristics of a firm’s own liabilities. As such, we do not believe that it likely that a standard discount curve can be defined\nwhich is appropriate to all insurers. Instead, we aim to provide standard components which can be utilised to derive an appropriate\ndiscount rate for any business. In order to determine the appropriate liability discount rate, a mapping will have to be performed\nbetween specific insurance contracts and market traded assets. As we have shown in this report, the choice of portfolio can have a\nsignificant impact on the final discount rate; the implied illiquidity premia for different ratings of corporate bonds are substantially\ndifferent. This is an essential consideration for both top-down and bottom-up approaches.\nThe method used in this report provides a straightforward application to break down estimates of illiquidity premia by rating and\nsector. We have focussed on corporate bonds, but the methodology could be extended to other asset classes if probability of\ndefault, recovery rate and cost-of-capital assumptions are available. The specific illiquidity premia for each asset class can then be\ncombined appropriately for any reference portfolio to derive a final discount rate.\n26 DECEMBER 2018 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nAppendix: Additional Data Tables\nTable 25 Settings\nEconomy Equity Risk Rating Source Targeted Ratings Base Risk Free\nPremium Rate\nCAD 3.40% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB CAD Treasury\nCNY 4.61% EDF-Implied AA, A, BBB, BB CNY Treasury\nEUR 4.43% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB DEM Treasury\nGBP 3.41% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB GBP Treasury\nHKD 4.94% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB HKD Treasury\nUSD 4.04% Moody’s SRA AAA, AA, A, BBB USD Treasury\nTable 26 Estimated ERP by Rating\nEconomy AAA AA A BBB BB\nCAD N/A 2.49% 3.68% 3.57% N/A\nCNY N/A 3.54% 3.59% 3.32% 5.18%\nEUR N/A 4.31% 4.36% 4.51% N/A\nGBP N/A 3.59% 3.44% 3.41% N/A\nHKD N/A 3.79% 5.52% 4.72% N/A\nUSD 4.01% 3.57% 3.81% 4.30% N/A\nTable 27 Estimated ERP by Sector\nEconomy Financial Non-Financial\nCAD 1.67% 3.74%\nCNY 3.66% 6.67%\nEUR 1.60% 4.73%\nGBP 0.91% 3.87%\nHKD 2.91% 5.93%\nUSD 2.17% 4.35%\n27 DECEMBER 2018 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\nReferences\nIFRS Foundation, IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts—the accounting model in one page, 2018\nJessop, Nick “IFRS 17 Discount Rates”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2018\nNazeran, Pooya and Douglas Dwyer “Credit Risk Modeling of Public Firms: EDF9”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2015\nRobinson, Peter and Harry Hibbert “Calibrating G2 Dual Term Premium Credit Model using Bond Spreads and EDFs”, Moody’s\nAnalytics White Paper, 2019\nThompson, Alasdair and Nick Jessop “A Cost of Capital Approach to Estimating Credit Risk Premia”, Moody’s Analytics White\nPaper, 2018\nZhang, Jing “The new Impairment Model under IFRS 9 and CECL”, Risk Books, 2018\n28 DECEMBER 2018 IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA DEC 18ENTERPRISE RISK SOLUTIONS\n© 2019 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
