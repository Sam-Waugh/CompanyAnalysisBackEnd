The\nfailed institutions were unusual in that they catered to the technology sector in the case of Silicon Valley Bank\nand the crypto markets in the cases of Signature and Silvergate. Of course, tech has been hit hard over the past\nyear, beginning with the slide in the stock prices of most tech companies, and the crypto market has suffered\nsomething of a crash. There may be other banks with outsize exposure to tech and crypto, but if so, they are\nsmall.\nAlso unusual is that almost all of the depositors at Silicon Valley Bank had very large deposits that as such were\nnot fully insured by the FDIC. Since the financial crisis, the deposit insurance limit has been $250,000. Many of\nthe tech companies with these big deposits were quick to move their deposits out of the bank, sensitive to their\nrisk. Compare this to the typical bank for whom well over half of deposits are below the FDIC limit and are\ngenerally very sticky. That is, depositors are slow to move their accounts, even for a better deal somewhere\nelse.\nFurther containing any fallout from the bank failures on the rest of the banking system is that system’s\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS / Copyright © 2023, Moody's Analytics, Inc.All Rights Reserved.fundamental strength. In the wake of the financial crisis and reforms to the system, including the\ncomprehensive Dodd-Frank legislation, the banking system has significantly increased its capitalization. The\nTier 1 capital-to-asset ratio for the system has risen from less than 10% prior to the crisis to well over 13%\ntoday. The biggest banks must also engage in stress tests each year. These tests simulate the impact of severe\neconomic downturns on their balance sheets and income statements. They are also often required to\ndetermine the impact on their financials of big swings in interest rates, although that was not part of this year’s\ntests.\nFinancial System Is on Firm Financial Ground\nCommercial banks, %\n15 1.6\n1.4\n14\n1.2\n13\n1.0\n12 0.8\n0.6\n11\n0.4\n10\n0.2\n9 0.0\n00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nTier 1 capital ratio (L) Return on assets (R)\nSources: FDIC, Moody’s Analytics\nThe banking system’s strong financial performance is also not consistent with any significant problems. Loan\ngrowth has remained sturdy and consistent with the economy’s growth, suggesting that underwriting has been\ngenerally prudent, and that leverage is manageable. Indeed, credit quality has been stellar with only a few\npockets of developing concern. Delinquency and charge-off rates are rising, but this is simply a normalization\nafter big declines during the pandemic due to the massive government support. Net interest margins—the\ndifference between banks’ lending rates and their cost of funds—are narrowing with the inverted yield curve\n(short-term rates are higher than long-term rates), but they are still ample. Taken altogether, banks remain\nprofitable. The return on assets remains close to 1%, which is about as high as the ROA generally gets.\nBank Loan Credit Quality Is Good\nCommercial bank charge-off rate, %\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n90 95 00 05 10 15 20\nC&I Consumer Commercial RE Residential RE Credit card\nSources: Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nThe liquidity of the system is also much improved, because banks now must hold a sufficient amount of their\nassets in cash or assets that can be quickly converted into cash to meet net cash outflows in a stressed\nenvironment. This liquidity coverage ratio requirement pertains to banks with more than $50 billion in assets,\nbut only banks with more than $250 billion in assets must meet the most stringent version of the LCR. Of\ncourse, despite the system’s enhanced liquidity, the failed banks seem to have had insufficient liquidity to meet\ntheir deposit withdrawals. Regulators will need to consider the LCR requirement in the context of recent events.\nThis highlights what appears to be the most significant vulnerability of the banking system, namely a classic\nasset-liability mismatch. Because of the surge in interest rates and the drawdown of bank deposits over the\npast year, many banks are struggling with how to meet depositors’ demands. Smaller banks and credit unions\nare having the most difficulty and are responding by restraining their lending, selling Treasury and mortgage\nsecurities, and borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks—FHLB advances are quickly increasing. But\nhaving said this, these banks have mostly smaller depositors who are much less footloose and whose deposits\nare covered by FDIC insurance. They are steadily, but slowly drawing down their deposits, allowing for an\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS / Copyright © 2023, Moody's Analytics, Inc.All Rights Reserved.orderly adjustment by the banks.\nFinancial Institutions Need Liquidity\nFHLB advances as a % of GDP\n7\nFinancial\n6 Crisis\n5\n4 S&L\nCrisis\n3\n2\n1\n0\n50 60 70 80 90 00 10 20\nSources: FHFA, BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nPolicymakers’ aggressive response to the bank failures will also forestall them becoming a systemic threat. The\nFederal Reserve, Treasury and FDIC have determined the failures are a systemic risk and have thus invoked\nauthority provided by the post-financial-crisis reforms to provide FDIC insurance to all depositors in the failed\nbanks. This should allay depositors’ fears about getting their money and end any bank runs. The Fed also stood\nup a new credit facility, the Bank Term Funding Program, a one-year facility that allows depositories to pledge\nqualified assets at par in exchange for advances at reasonably attractive rates. Treasury will use up to $25\nbillion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund to fund the creation the facility, which should meaningfully lessen\nliquidity needs of banks, at least in the near term.\nDespite optimism that fallout on the financial system from the bank failures will be contained, they likely will\nimpact monetary policy. The Fed will be under pressure to pause its rate hikes, and it is likely they will not raise\nrates at their March meeting. We had previously expected a quarter-point rate hike. So-called financial\nconditions are one of the factors used in Fed monetary policy decisions, and the current turmoil in the system\nwill likely lead to a tightening in underwriting standards and less credit availability. The Fed will pause its rate\nhikes to gauge just how much conditions have tightened, and what the impact is on the economy and\nultimately inflation. We now expect two more quarter-percentage-point rate hikes, 25 basis points each time,\nat the May and June meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nWhile highly uncertain given how quickly events are unfolding, the impact of the bank failures on the economic\noutlook should be on the margin. The economy will struggle this year and next and will remain vulnerable to\nevents like those of the past several days, but this banking crisis is unlikely to push the economy into recession.\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS / Copyright © 2023, Moody's Analytics, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2023, Moody's Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates (together, \"Moody's\").
