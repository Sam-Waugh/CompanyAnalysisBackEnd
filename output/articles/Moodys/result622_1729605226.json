In order to calculate it, the\ninstitution can choose between two possible ways as defined in article 22 of the “Basel III Document Revisions to the\nsecuritisation framework”:\na. The weighted-average maturity of the contractual remaining cash flows of a tranche, is calculated using the following\nformula:\n∑𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 × 𝐶𝐶𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡\nWhere denotes the cash flows (the sum of princ𝑀𝑀ipa𝑇𝑇 l, =interes ∑t a𝑡𝑡n 𝐶𝐶d\n𝐹𝐹\nfe𝑡𝑡es) contractually paid in the period t by the\nborrower.\n𝐶𝐶𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡\nThis approach is also known as the Weighted Average Maturity, WAM, approach.\nb. Based on tranche final legal maturity, using the formula:\nWhere stands for the tranche final legal m 𝑀𝑀at𝑇𝑇ur =ity. 1 +(𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿 −1) × 80%\n𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿\nThe latter is easier to implement, but produces maturity levels consistently higher than the WAM approach regardless of the\nassumptions applied.\nThe below table shows the joint distribution of tranche maturity results for German Auto-ABS calculated using:\na. WAM approach with Baseline macroeconomic scenario (see description of approach below).\nb. Tranche Legal Maturity.\nFigure 3 Joint distribution of tranche maturity for German Auto-ABS\nAs can be seen from the table above:\n» There are almost no cases where the Legal Maturity approach leads to lower tranche maturity (lower diagonal).\n» Almost half the tranches with a Legal Maturity implied WAM of 5 years have an Average Life implied maturity of 1-2\nyears.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CALCULATION OF TRANCHE MATURITY FOR SEC-ERBA 5Assumptions for Calculating the WAM\nIn the below analysis, we are investigating the various assumptions that can be applied to calculate the WAM, as well as their\nfeasibility and impacts on RWAs results.\nApplying Default and Prepayment assumptions\nWhen forecasting cashflows of securitizations, the waterfall model requires default and prepayment vectors to generate\ncollateral cashflows. The current “Draft Guidelines on the determination of the WAM of a tranche”4 recommends applying zero\nfuture prepayments and zero future defaults to collateral cashflows.\nRunning Macroeconomic Assumptions\nFuture pool performance for securitization under a macroeconomic scenario is forecasted using a credit model. The forecasted\nprepayment and default vectors will be used to project collateral cash flows, which are then passed through the waterfall\nmodel of the securitization to derive tranche cashflows. Figure 4 below shows the methodology used to determine the WAM\nusing macroeconomic forecasts.\nFigure 4 Historical and Forecasted default (CDR) for Italy MBS Prime\nMacroeconomic Forecasts\nThe economic forceasts are generated using a macroeconomic model which captures both interconnectedness among\neconomic regions and country-specific idiosyncracies. Moody’s Analytics Global Macroeconomic Model produces forecasts for\nmore than 15,000 time series across 100+ countries that collectively constitute more than 95% of global GDP5. While the\nmodel structure is similar across countries, the framework allows for country-specific variations of key equations and for\ninclusion of tailpipe equations for variables important for some countries.\nMoody’s Analytics uses its global forecasting framework to quantify its economic outlook in the form of a Baseline forecast,\ngenerated on a monthly basis. The forecast is produced based on globally consistent assumptions that reflect the view\nregarding the economic outlook. The global assumptions are augmented by region and country-specific assumptions if\nrequired. The Baseline is used as an anchor for Moody’s Analytics suite of scenarios that captures the key risks to the global\noutlook.\n4 https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/2883227/52eb10d7-085d-4401-8b74-cec60d710b7d/EBA-CP-2019-\n08%20CP%20on%20the%20draft%20GLs%20for%20the%20determination%20of%20WAM.pdf?retry=1\n5 For more details please refer to M. Hopkins, “Moody’s Analytics Global Macroeconomic Model Methodology”, March 2018.\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/whitepaper/2018/global-macroeconomic-model-description-short-version.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CALCULATION OF TRANCHE MATURITY FOR SEC-ERBA 6Credit Models\nA credit model is an analytic tool to assess credit risk and measure performance over different macroeconomic scenarios for\nportfolios of different asset classes. Moody’s Analytics Credit models solution consists of loan-level and pool-level\neconometric models for performance variables like delinquencies, CPR, CDR, and severities6.\nWaterfall Models\nEach security receives cashflows according to the priority of payments described in its deal waterfall. Moody’s Analytics’\nsolution includes extensive deal libraries with accurate and validated waterfalls and collateral data updated every payment\nperiod which facilitates cash flow analytics on structured transactions7.\n6 https://www.moodysanalytics.com/solutions-overview/credit-risk/credit-risk-modeling\n7 https://www.moodysanalytics.com/solutions-overview/structured-finance/structured-finance-sell-side-solutions\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CALCULATION OF TRANCHE MATURITY FOR SEC-ERBA 7Analysis\nHistorical pool performance\nAn assumption of zero prepayments will project pool performance quite differently to historically observed performance. The\nhistorical average of reported Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR) in the Moody’s Analytics EMEA active universe of securitized\ncollateral pools as of end of October 2019 is 13.8%.\nAcross the Moody’s Analytics EMEA active universe of securities, there are multiple cases of significant differences in average\nreported CPR, for example Slate No 1 plc (UK RMBS) has a reported average CPR since issuance of around 15.6%, while VCL\n26 (German Auto leases) has a reported average CPR since issuance of around 1.6%.\nOn the other hand, forecasted CPR for each asset class and region derived from a macrcoeconomic scenario is much more in\nline with historical reported CPR. For example, the chart below compares historical performance data and forecasted data for\nUK MBS Prime.\nFigure 5 Historical and forecasted prepayment (CPR) for UK MBS Prime\nThe above chart shows the prepayment rate forecast for the average UK MBS Prime – 2015 vintage over the next five years,\nunder a Baseline macroeconomic scenario. Here, the model does not take into account any specific pool fixed effects.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CALCULATION OF TRANCHE MATURITY FOR SEC-ERBA 8Similarly, forecasted CDR for a specific asset class and region derived from a macroeconomic scenario is much more in line\nwith historical reported CDR. For example, the chart below compare historical performance data and forecasted data for Italy\nMBS Prime.\nFigure 6 Historical and Forecasted default (CDR) for Italy MBS Prime\nThe above chart shows the default rate forecast for the average Italian MBS Prime – 2015 vintage over the next five years,\nunder a Baseline macroeconomic scenario. Here, the model does not take into account any specific pool fixed effects.\nImpact on Tranche Maturity Result\nWe have run analysis on the effect of different scenario assumptions on WAM and RWA calculations across a dataset of 1000\nsampled securities from nine countries, and fifteen asset classes, the “Research Dataset”. Securities were randomly sampled\nwithin their group of asset class and country. The number of deals selected for each group depended on the size of the group in\nthe Moody’s Analytics EMEA universe of structured finance securities.\nFor the Research Dataset, running zero default/prepayment assumption leads to a 3.2 years higher WAM compared to running\na Baseline Macroeconomic scenario. This is illustrated by the chart below which compares the regional impact on Tranche\nMaturity when running a Baseline scenario, a zero default/prepayment assumption or when using the legal maturity approach.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CALCULATION OF TRANCHE MATURITY FOR SEC-ERBA 9Figure 7 Tranche Maturity Calculated using Baseline, zero default/prepayment and legal maturity\nImpact on RWA Result\nAs a result the derived average RWA in the Research Dataset is 3.35 percentage points higher when running zero\ndefault/prepayment. Results vary widely by asset class, region and seniority.\nRunning zero default/prepayment assumptions and comparing with results when running a Baseline scenario, we notice the\nfollowing:\n» Asset Class: The MBS Prime asset class, which is the most heavily represented asset class in our Research datasetwith 366\ntranches, exhibited an average RWA 3.9 percentage points higher when running zero default/prepayment compared to\nBaseline.\n» Region: Deals with collateral based in the Italy exhibited the greatest regional sensitivity, with an average RWA 7.6\npercentage point higher when running zero default/prepayment compared to Baseline.\n» Seniority: junior tranches across all countries and asset classes are most significantly impacted with an average RWA of\n3.25 percentage point higher when running zero default/prepayment compared to Baseline.\nThe two charts below compare the regional impact on RWA for senior and non-senior tranches when calculating maturity\nrunning a Baseline scenario, a zero default/prepayment assumption or when using the legal maturity approach.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CALCULATION OF TRANCHE MATURITY FOR SEC-ERBA 10Figure 8 RWA comparison for senior tranches using Baseline, zero default/prepayment and legal maturity\nFigure 9 RWA comparison for non-senior tranches using Baseline, zero default/prepayment and legal maturity\nThe average RWA of a zero default/prepayment based approach is higher across various regions and assets.\nTo confirm that results are not driven by the choice of macroeconomic scenario, we ran the same analysis on other Moody’s\nAnalytics scenarios. On the Research Dataset, the use of a Moderate Recession scenario resulted in RWA levels 0.63\npercentage points higher than a Baseline scenario, while a Protracted Slump resulted in 0.9 percentage points higher. We\nconcluded that the choice of scenario has relatively low impact on the results.\nSummary\nBanks implementing ERBA can choose to use the calculated WAM method to compute tranche maturity (WAM) using cash\nflow projections, in order to obtain some RWA relief in exchange for investing in the more analytical approach. We have\nassessed the impact on RWA of a zero default and prepayment assumption on a sample of 1000 ISINs, and it produced results\nthat were consistently less conservative than using the Legal Maturity and consistently more conservative than a\nmacroeconomic approach.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CALCULATION OF TRANCHE MATURITY FOR SEC-ERBA 11© 2019 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
