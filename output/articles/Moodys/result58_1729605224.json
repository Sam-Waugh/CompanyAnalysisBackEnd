In recent years, there has been growing pressure to become climate aware in the\n+44.20.7772.5454\nOwn Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) processes.\nclientservices.emea@moodys.com\nWe have seen the increased focus from national and international bodies and groups on\nAsia (Excluding Japan)\nclimate change. The Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), Task Force on Climate-Related\n+85.2.2916.1121\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) are\namong some of those, calling for detailed scenario analysis in relation to climate disclosures.\nJapan\n+81.3.5408.4100 In April 2021, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) stated\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com that “the materialization of transition risk has the potential of disrupting the sectoral\ncomposition of the economy, for example from carbon-intensive to green sectors. This may\nput carbon orientated investment strategies under pressure with assets becoming stranded”.\nThe following year, in May 2022 the Bank of England stated that “banks and insurers will need\nto prioritize investment in their climate risk assessment capabilities, both by focusing on their\ninternal modeling and data capabilities and doing more to scrutinize data and projections\nsupplied by third parties”. They went on to say that in certain scenarios “banks would reduce\nlending to properties facing greater physical risks and insurers would substantially increase the\npremiums they charge to insure against such risks, making insurance coverage unaffordable\nfor many of these households”.\nWe are now seeing institutions looking to move on from being climate aware to becoming\ntruly climate resilient. At Moody’s Analytics, we hear this from our clients, and we can also see\nthis trend in a recent study we conducted which found that the key drivers for climate\nscenario analysis were disclosure (TCFD requirements) and regulation. We also see the\nimportance of quantitative modeling coming to the forefront along with the need to address\ntransitional risk and physical risk.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS FOR THE LIFE INSURANCE SECTOR 1Scenario analysis at the heart of risk modeling\nScenario analysis has long been at the heart of modeling for life insurers with both deterministic and stochastic scenarios used.\nThis remains the case whether an institution has a shorter term awareness goal or longer term resilience goal: the first step is to\nunderstand the impact on the business. However, climate change scenarios also need to be linked to a policy narrative, for\nexample BAU—which assumes temperatures rise at the current predicted rate—or Net Zero. Life insurers need to understand the\nimplications of the effects of climate change itself. The physical risks, and the implications of policy changes designed to address\nor prevent climate change - the transition risks.\nIt can seem that institutions are expected to become experts in climate science, environmental economics, macroeconomics,\ntechnology change, and socio-economic uncertainty. This can be daunting but there are approaches that help break down the\nproblem. An insurer can start with socio-economic assumptions to define a pathway, then use the appropriate model depending\non whether physical or transition risks are being considered. Finally, they can layer in impact analysis to show how the economy,\necosystems, or financial markets might be affected. Using quantitative scenarios here helps bring clarity and ensures that the\nmodeling is open to scrutiny. It also helps life insurers address climate risks within their existing business practices.\nThe very nature of the topic means that there is a high level of uncertainty covering climate change effects to technology\nadvancements. There is also model risk to contend with. However, after they are articulated, the economic, and financial aspects\nare ideal for scenario analysis.\nThe importance of sources\nAs important as the models themselves, are the sources used and there are several options available. At Moody’s Analytics, we\ncreate scenarios using our Scenario Generator to model paths for market risks and asset returns. These paths embed the effects\nattributed to stated climate narratives. Our customers can then understand the impact of climate change on their business\nwithout having to do the mapping from variables with a less intuitive connection to the financial sector. The narrative assumptions\ncan be taken from various global bodies. The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) narratives include Net Zero 2050,\nCurrent Policies, Below 2C and Divergent Net Zero. These are popular with financial institutions and were the basis of the Bank of\nEngland’s recent Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) exercise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nprovides governments with information that they can use to develop climate policies and includes narratives such as AR5 and AR6.\nThe UN Inevitable Policy Response group (IPR) is designed to help financial institutions navigate transition and model the effects\nof policies on the real economy out to 2050 such as the Forecast Policy Scenario (FPR).\nLife insurers need to ensure that they understand the scenarios available and decide which are most appropriate for their\nobjectives, that is, stress testing or asset allocation. They also need to choose scenarios that reflect physical risks or transition risks\nin line with their objectives. Physical risks are direct effects from rising temperatures. They can be acute and potentially transient\nand diversifiable or chronic and systemic. In either case, they do not consider any behavior or policy response. In contrast,\ntransition risks are permanent shifts driven by policy.\nIn reality, the interaction between the two is complex and intertwined. For life insurers, understanding the impact of the\nintroduction of carbon prices is key. A transition scenario will include tax on CO2 emissions. This is a significant cost early in the\nscenario but it will drive technological change. So, in the short term, energy prices increase, which leads to inflation, but in the\nmedium term, the technology advancements should reduce energy costs and thus inflation. Further to this, life insurers need to be\nable to quantify the impact of transition risk on different sectors. It seems intuitive that sectors dependent on fossil fuels will be\nhard hit in scenarios modeling a steep increase in carbon tax but it is likely that different sectors will be affected at different\nspeeds. Scenario analysis can help model choices around the evolution of the energy mix.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS FOR THE LIFE INSURANCE SECTOR 2Keeping up to date as technology and the environment evolve\nIt is also vital that life insurers keep up to date as the guidance evolves to ensure that they can embed current climate risk into\ntheir scenarios. In May 2020, NGFS released its first set of climate scenarios. These were open source and available on the\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) website. Since then, Phase 2 and Phase 3 updates have been published,\nwhich have been used for regulatory exercises like central bank stress tests. The NGFS scenarios differed from previous initiatives\nas they incorporated physical and transition risks into one data set. They are not without their limitations. But at Moody’s\nAnalytics, we believe they are a good starting point, and help life insurers take the first steps to becoming climate aware. The most\nrecent Phase 3 release uses the same narratives and models but some of the assumptions have changed to reflect the changing\nenvironment.\nThe Phase 3 scenarios cover a good range of possible policy risks, for example, whether transition aims at 1.5C or 2C, whether it\nhappens now or is delayed. They also look across Integrated Assessment Models’ different technology assumptions and different\nsensitivities for chronic physical risk. A key advantage is to be able to use a single scenario across different models. But we must\nremember that different Integrated Assessment Models have different assumptions about factors such as capital cost or land\nusage. Different technology assumptions can be significant when looking at optimal energy mixes or carbon taxes. Ideally, we\ncould consider different paths, for example, high level of carbon capture versus none.\nContinuing challenges for life insurers\nSector modeling remains a challenge. There is still scope for significant differences, and nuance and interpretation is important. It\ncan be a complex process to assess the impact on the balance sheet fully, as it involves aligning all of the assumptions between\nmacro and sector modeling. Underlying common input is needed to isolate impacts but can have significant effects, for example\nwhen linking a lower emissions path to lower growth or vice versa.\nThere are criticisms to this approach, including around the level of economic damage in the scenarios or even the basis of using\nneo-classical economic assumptions in the first place. There are sections of the sustainability community that believe system\nchange or even degrowth should be considered. Overall, the emerging consensus across the models is that it is cheaper to act now\nthan do nothing in the long run; but that might be some way off. Ultimately there is a political and controversial question around\nwho pays and how.\nBuilding a sustainable, resilient business for the future\nMany questions remain. What is clear, is that climate scenarios are central to climate change modeling for life insurers, which in\nturn is vital for stress testing such as the ORSA or external reporting such as TCFD. This is only going to grow in importance as life\ninsurers adapt their strategies and seek to build a sustainable, resilient business for the future. They do however, have tools and\nresources at their disposal to incorporate quantitative scenario analysis—with up-to-date information—into their businesses, to\nsupport them on this journey.\nFor more insights on this topic, scan below to listen to our podcast series: Forward-looking climate scenario analysis for the life\ninsurance sector.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS FOR THE LIFE INSURANCE SECTOR 3© 2023 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
