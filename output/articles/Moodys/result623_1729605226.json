Introduction\nUnder IFRS 17 the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is “…the compensation an entity requires for bearing the uncertainty about\nthe amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risks as the entity fulfils insurance contracts.”1 The calculation\nmethod is not prescribed and is the choice of the insurance company, subject to the principles detailed in paragraphs B91 and\nB922 of the standard. As the methodology for the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is regarded as a significant judgment, the\napproach used must be disclosed. In addition:\n“…An entity shall disclose the confidence level used to determine the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. If the entity uses a\ntechnique other than the confidence level technique for determining the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, it shall disclose the\ntechnique used and the confidence level corresponding to the results of that technique…”3\nWe interpret the “confidence level” referred to here as the probability that the change in the Present Value of Future cash flows\n(PVCFs) over a one-year horizon will be lower than the risk adjustment (under changes to non-financial risks only). So the entity\ncan either choose a confidence level and derive a risk adjustment (using the confidence level, or VaR, technique) or use another\ntechnique to calculate a risk adjustment and then translate this into an associated confidence level. Either way, the entity\nmust take a view of the distribution of the change in PVCFs over a one-year horizon. In this paper, we consider two different\nmethods for choosing such a distribution and calculate the equivalent confidence level under each method and under different\nassumptions. We will illustrate each method using a case study, which is introduced in the next section.\n2. Case study\nTo demonstrate the impact different translation methods can have on the disclosed equivalent IFRS 17 risk adjustment confidence\nlevel, we consider an entity that calculates economic capital on a Solvency II standard formula basis and its own economic capital\nbasis. The entity writes regular premium term assurances and has derived distributions for its lapse, mortality, and expense risk in\nits internal modeling. However, as it reports on a Solvency II Standard Formula basis, and already produces a risk margin, it has\nchosen the cost of capital approach4 to determine its IFRS 17 risk adjustment.\nUnder the cost of capital approach, the capital requirement for non-financial risk at a specific percentile, is projected for the\nlifetime of the business. The present value of these capital requirements is then calculated using an appropriate discount rate and\na cost of capital is applied. In our example, the percentile of the capital requirements was 99.5th and the cost of capital used was\n6%. The resulting IFRS 17 risk adjustment is calculated as 29.7 million.\n3. Method 1 – Assumed distribution for PVCFs\nPerhaps the simplest approach is to assume a parametric distribution (for example, normal, lognormal, or Students’ T) for the\nchange in PVCFs and calibrate its parameters to other available value or risk metrics. In this example, we consider distributions\nthat are described by two parameters, and choose these parameters so that:\n» The median of the distribution is zero.\n» The 99.5th percentile of the distribution is 47.9 million, the Solvency II standard formula SCR for non-financial risk, which in this\ncase is readily available as part of the entity’s regulatory reporting.\nFigure 1 shows the projected capital requirements for non-financial risk, the resulting risk adjustments calculated under the cost\nof capital method, and their mapping to an equivalent confidence level.\n1 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts – Appendix A Defined Terms\n2 Potential calculation methodologies are discussed in more detail in the Moody’s Analytics paper “Calculating the IFRS 17 risk\nadjustment” Hannibal, C. (2018)\n3 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts – Paragraph B119\n4 The cost of capital approach and other potential calculation methodologies are discussed in more detail in the Moody’s Analytics\npaper “Calculating the IFRS 17 risk adjustment” Hannibal, C. (2018)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EQUIVALENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL FOR THE IFRS 17 RISK ADJUSTMENT 03Figure 1 – Mapping of risk adjustment to equivalent confidence level (normal distribution)\n50 Projected non-market SCR (t-1) 50\n45 Risk Adjustment (CoC method 6%) 45\n40 Risk Adjustment (CoC method 4%) 40\n35 35\n30 30\n25 25\n20 20\n15 15\n10 10\n5 5\n0 0\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1\nTime t Percentile (normal distribution)\nThe bar chart on the left shows the projected non-market SCR, with the yellow bar highlighting the non-market SCR at t=0. The\norange and green lines show the resultant risk adjustments, calculated by discounting these projected non-market SCRs and\napplying different costs of capital (6% in orange and 4% in green).\nThe chart on the right shows the percentiles of a normal distribution (gray line) calibrated so that it matches the assumed median\n(0) and 99.5th percentile (47.9 million).\nGiven this distribution, we can easily calculate the resulting equivalent confidence levels corresponding to risk adjustments\ncalculated using different cost of capital assumptions. In this case, the equivalent confidence levels are calculated as 94.5%\n(assuming 6% cost of capital) and 85.7% (assuming 4% cost of capital).\nUnder the cost of capital technique, although the risk adjustment is calculated using projected capital requirements at a 99.5%\nconfidence level, it does not mean that the equivalent confidence levels for the risk adjustment are equal to 99.5%. Under the\ncost of capital approach, the risk adjustment is calculated by projecting 99.5% capital requirements over the entire coverage\nperiod, discounting, summing, and multiplying by the chosen cost of capital. The resulting risk adjustments in this case are lower\nthan the SCR for non-financial risk, and so the equivalent confidence levels are lower than 99.5%.\nThe advantage of this method is its simplicity. It is simpler to explain than some other methods so it is pertinent for disclosures.\nThe method does not require any stochastic models or complex calculations. It is quick and simple to calculate so it is unlikely to\ndelay a reporting process as long as the corresponding Solvency II (or other economic capital basis) inputs are available.\nConversely, this method makes some broad assumptions. In particular, it assumes the distribution of the best estimate liabilities\n(BEL) is an appropriate proxy for the distribution of the IFRS 17 PVCFs. Whether this assumption is appropriate depends largely\non the consistency between the IFRS 17 cash flows and those assumed for Solvency II (or the economic capital basis used for the\ncalibration). Elements to consider include contract boundaries, application of stresses, and the exclusion of financial risks.\nThis method is sensitive to the shape of the chosen distribution, as shown by the difference in result when alternative\ndistributions are used in place of the normal distribution. To illustrate, Figure 2 shows the translation of the risk adjustment\n(assuming 6% cost of capital) to equivalent confidence levels using the Students’ T distribution (with different degrees of\nfreedom) in addition to a normal distribution. In all cases, the distributions are calibrated to match the same median and 99.5th\npercentile. Figure 3 shows the resulting equivalent confidence levels.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EQUIVALENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL FOR THE IFRS 17 RISK ADJUSTMENT 04Figure 2 – Mapping of risk adjustment to equivalent confidence level (normal, t5, and t2 distributions for PVCFs)\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1\nFigure 3 – Equivalent confidence level assuming different parametric distributions for change in PVCFs\nAssumed distribution for PVCFs Risk adjustment equivalent confidence level\nNormal 94.5%\nStudents’ T (5 degrees of freedom) 97.3%\nStudents’ T (2 degrees of freedom) 98.7%\nIn this example, the equivalent confidence level varies between 94.5% and 98.7% depending on the assumed distribution, even\nthough these have been calibrated to the same reference percentiles (median and 99.5th percentile). Furthermore, other choices\nare available, in particular:\n» A different assumed distribution. Our example shows the normal and Students’ T distributions but other distributions might be\ndeemed more appropriate.\n» A different reference percentile. This might naturally be the case where an internal economic capital basis is used instead of\nSolvency II that has been calibrated to a different percentile.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EQUIVALENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL FOR THE IFRS 17 RISK ADJUSTMENT 05\nswolf\nhsac\nVP\nni\negnahC\nNormal distribution\nt5 distribution\nt2 distribution\nRisk Adjustment (CoC method 6%)\nPercentile4. Method 2 – Assumed distribution for non-financial risk\nUnder this method, the distribution of the change in PVCFs is not assumed but generated using a model for the underlying non-\nfinancial risk factors. This method requires generating several thousand scenarios and recalculating the PVCFs under each one and\nso is better suited to companies that have scenario-based internal models and/or highly efficient cash flow models. Models that\nuse techniques such as proxy modeling might also be a suitable alternative. However, even in these cases, the resource required\nmight not be available within the required timelines.\nFor our case study, we have generated 100,000 scenarios assuming the different marginal distributions for each of the underlying\nnon-financial risk factors (in this case mortality, lapse, and expense shocks). In all cases, 99.5th percentiles of the distributions are\nchosen to equal the corresponding Solvency II standard formula assumptions and a Gaussian copula dependency is assumed.\nFigure 4 shows the resulting distributions for the PVCFs and translation of the risk adjustment (assuming 6% cost of capital),\nwhile Figure 5 shows the resulting equivalent confidence levels.\nFigure 4 – Mapping of risk adjustment to equivalent confidence level (normal, t5, and t2 distributions for risk factors)\nFigure 5 – Equivalent confidence level assuming different distributions for underlying risk factors\nAssumed risk factor distribution Risk adjustment equivalent confidence level\nNormal 97.3%\nStudents’ T (5 degrees of freedom) 98.6%\nStudents’ T (2 degrees of freedom) 99.0%\nThis method gives a range of equivalent confidence levels depending on the assumed distribution of the underlying risk factors.\nOther choices are available; in this case, for the assumed copula and the marginal distributions for the risk factors.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EQUIVALENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL FOR THE IFRS 17 RISK ADJUSTMENT 065. Conclusions\nOne factor to consider when choosing a risk adjustment methodology is the requirement to disclose the equivalent confidence\nlevel. Entities without existing capital-based reporting regimes might prefer to use the VaR method directly to avoid subsequent\ncalculations to translate the result. Entities wishing to use elements of their existing capital reporting process can use a VaR\nmethod or some other method. Where they use a method other than VaR, a translation methodology is also required.\nThe decision for the translation methodology depends on many factors, including:\n» Accuracy, complexity, and ease of communication. Some of the methodologies described in this paper are challenging to\nimplement and difficult to explain. The complexity and accuracy of the IFRS 17 risk adjustment calculation must be considered\nas it would be inappropriate for the translation methodology to be more complex than the underlying IFRS 17 risk adjustment\ncalculation methodology.\n» Availability of data, models, and modeling resources. The methodologies described in this paper rely on outputs from and/or\nmodels used for other reporting processes. These might or might not be available within the IFRS 17 reporting timeline.\n» Stability of results. The purpose of equivalent confidence level is to facilitate comparisons, both over time and between\ndifferent entities, so the translation methodology itself should not be volatile and should not change frequently. For example, a\nmethodology that relies on output or models that are not available at every reporting cycle would not be appropriate.\nThis paper shows that after calculating a single value for the IFRS 17 risk adjustment, several different equivalent percentiles can\nbe derived depending on the translation methodology used. In our examples alone, the equivalent percentile could be anything\nbetween 94.5% and 99.0%. Choosing an appropriate methodology for the translation can have as much of an impact as choosing\nthe methodology for the IFRS 17 risk adjustment calculation itself.\n6.
