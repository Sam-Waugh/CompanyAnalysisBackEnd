The firm’s one-year probability of default increased from 0.4% in\nFebruary 2012 to 2.71% as of August 16, 2012. In implied ratings terms, its current EDF level is consistent\nwith a B3 rating, down sharply from an implied rating near single-A at the start of the year.\nBecause Groupon does not have traded bonds or CDS from which to observe credit spreads, and because it\nis not rated by any of the major global credit rating agencies, Moody’s Analytics’ public EDF measures\nprovide a unique view into the company’s credit risk. As Figure 1 on the cover of this report shows,\nGroupon’s EDF measure has gone up significantly since March 2012. The company is facing stiff competition\nfrom LivingSocial, Google Offers, AmazonLocal, and other imitators in over 50 countries across the globe.\nThe heightened competition pushed Groupon to develop an aggressive business expansion strategy, which\nincluded actions to raise capital and make new acquisitions. Some of the most notable acquisitions included\nCityDeal, Darberry.ru, Qpod, ClanDescuento and Taggle, which were among the top three daily-discount\ndeals sites in Europe, Russia, Japan, South America and India respectively.\nAs we show in Figure 2 and Figure 3, Groupon’s EDF measure has not only increased in absolute terms, but\nalso relative to its peers in the US internet information providers sector. In Figure 2, we show the time series\nof Groupon’s EDF measure since its initial public offering in November 2011, as well as the EDF measures for\nLinkedIn Corp., Pandora Media Inc, and Yelp Inc. Among this small group, Groupon shows a significantly\nhigher risk of default and a distinctly negative trend.\nFigure 2: Groupon’s EDF Measure vs. Selected Internet Sector Peers’ EDFs\n2 17 AUGUST 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nFigure 3: Groupon’s EDF vs. It’s Peer Industry Group\nFigure 3 shows that over the past six months Groupon’s EDF measure has underperformed the entire\ninternet information providers sector. The graph shows Groupon’s EDF measure versus the median, 25th,\nand 75th percentile EDFs for its industry peer group. As recently as February 2012, Groupon’s EDF measure\nwas within the 25th percentile of its industry sector. Since that time its probability of default has risen\nquickly and is now trending among the riskiest firms in its industry, with its EDF measure five times greater\nthan the median for its industry group.\nMoody’s Analytics’ research has shown that firms whose EDFs underperform their industry sectors (i.e., rise\nfaster than their peers) experience higher default rates than outperforming firms with similar EDF levels.\nBased on data from 1992 to 2011, we calculated one-year default rates conditioned on a firm’s EDF level and\non the relative EDF change versus its sector. Relative performance is measured by the difference in the\nchange in a firm’s EDF measure and the change in its industry median EDF measure.\nFigure 4 shows the results. For ease of presentation, we bucketed EDF levels and change versus sector into\nten equally sized categories (deciles), shown across the top row. The first column represents the deciles of\nEDF level. Each cell in the table shows the one-year default rate for each EDF level decile, relative change\ndecile combination. Firms whose EDF measures underperform their industry sectors generally experience\nhigher default rates, regardless of EDF level. In Figure 4, this is shown by the fact that default rates increase\nfrom left to right. Taken with the data from Figure 3, the table suggests that the trend of Groupon’s EDF\nmetric versus its industry group shows relatively heightened risk of default.\nFigure 4: Average Realized Default Rates by EDF Level and Relative Performance vs. Industry Sector\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ALL\n1 0.05% 0.03% 0.02% 0.00% 0.00% 0.01% 0.03% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.02%\n2 0.10% 0.05% 0.06% 0.06% 0.00% 0.00% 0.02% 0.07% 0.11% 0.27% 0.05%\n3 0.10% 0.06% 0.01% 0.03% 0.01% 0.03% 0.07% 0.06% 0.03% 0.18% 0.05%\n4 0.28% 0.12% 0.17% 0.15% 0.09% 0.10% 0.08% 0.09% 0.17% 0.30% 0.15%\n5 0.32% 0.23% 0.24% 0.32% 0.22% 0.24% 0.21% 0.27% 0.22% 0.46% 0.27%\n6 0.62% 0.44% 0.45% 0.34% 0.44% 0.56% 0.44% 0.72% 0.51% 0.97% 0.55%\n7 0.71% 0.56% 0.66% 0.80% 0.64% 0.72% 0.73% 1.06% 1.18% 1.63% 0.89%\n8 1.01% 1.01% 1.19% 1.25% 1.27% 1.44% 1.58% 1.65% 2.05% 3.10% 1.68%\n9 3.14% 2.22% 4.83% 5.16% 5.25% 4.34% 4.87% 5.75% 6.37% 8.39% 5.60%\n10 6.43% 4.68% 5.76% 7.70% 7.70% 6.96% 7.67% 9.31% 9.99% 13.70% 8.94%\nAll 0.66% 0.63% 1.08% 1.73% 1.73% 1.83% 2.24% 2.92% 3.13% 5.96% 2.16%\n3 17 AUGUST 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COM\nleveL\nFDE\nmriF\nEDF Change Relative to Industry Peer Group ChangeCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nUnderstanding the Drivers of Groupon’s EDF Measure\nIn this section we examine the drivers of Groupon’s EDF measure. In contrast to some black-box statistical\nmodels of credit risk, the drivers of the EDF model share many of the same basic approaches to measuring\ncredit risk as fundamental credit analysis. Studying these drivers in addition to the EDF itself helps identify\nwhy a firm’s default risk is changing.\nMoody’s Analytics’ public firm EDF model belongs to a class of credit risk models referred to as structural or\nasset value models. The basic assumption of asset value models is that there is a causal, economically\nmotivated reason that default occurs. Default is highly likely to occur when the market value of the firm\n(the sum of the value of its market capitalization and debt) is insufficient to cover its liabilities due at some\nfuture date – i.e. firms tend to default when they are insolvent. This follows from the fact that equity\nholders are residual claimants on the value of the firm. If the market value of the firm is negative, equity\nholders can and often will “put” the residual value of the firm to creditors.\nThe above economic intuition can be translated into three quantifiable variables: the expected value of a\nfirm’s assets (A), the volatility of its assets (denoted by σ), and its default point, X. The default point\nrepresents the amount of a firm’s liabilities due in the future that would trigger a default if not paid on time.\nThe interaction of the three variables is encapsulated by the firm’s distance-to-default (DD) which, under\nsome largely innocuous assumptions, can be expressed as:\nDD ≈ ( ln(A)-ln(X) ) / σ\nThis simple equation essentially states that a firm’s relative credit risk (measured by DD) is a function of its\nfinancial risk and its business risk, two factors that are core concepts of fundamental credit analysis. The\nnumerator of the above equation measures a firm’s financial leverage (X/A) based on market values – i.e.\nthe firm’s financial risk. All else equal, higher leverage decreases DD and hence increases the probability of\ndefault. The denominator of the DD equation represents the firm’s business risk. Firms in industries with\nhigh asset volatility tend to exhibit higher risk of default, all else equal. Once we have calculated a firm’s\nDD, we can derive its probability of default (its EDF measure) by looking at the historical average default rate\nconsistent with each DD level.\nFigure 5: Groupon’s Market Leverage, Default Point and Market Value of Assets\n4 17 AUGUST 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nGroupon‘s climbing EDF metric has primarily been the result of two adverse trends: an increase in its market\nleverage and a jump in its asset volatility. The changes in these two drivers of the EDF show that Groupon\nfaces both financial challenges as well as a real increase in its business risk.\nFigure 5 shows the times series of Groupon’s market leverage and its components – its market value of\nassets and default point. Market leverage is simply the ratio of the default point to the market value of\nassets. Along with the aggressive business expansion, growth in Groupon’s core daily-discount deals\nbusiness appears to have hit wall, and investors have started to question the firm’s future profitability. This\nis directly shown in the company’s poor performance in the equity market, which as of August 16, 2012, is\n75% below its initial public offering price of USD 20 in November 2011. The company’s plummeting equity\nvalue has translated into a rapid decrease in the company’s market asset value over the same period.\nAlthough Groupon’s default point – an estimate of the amount of debt due in one year that would trigger a\ncredit event – has risen by 40% over the past six months, it is the fall in its market value of assets that has\nled to a marked fall in the market value of the company’s net worth. The gap between the default point and\nmarket value of assets has decreased from USD 17.4 billion to USD 3.3 billion in just six months.\nConsequently, Groupon’s market leverage has jumped significantly. Groupon’s current market leverage level\nof 25.2% is the highest in the internet information providers group, and twice the sector’s average.\nFigure 6: Groupon’s EDF Metric and Asset Volatility\nGroupon has also shown a material increase in its business risk since the start of the year. The most notable\nquestion regarding Groupon’s business risk is whether its business model is sustainable, particularly\nconsidering the growing numbers of competitors. With low barriers to entry, a customer base with a high\ndegree of price sensitivity, and powerful competitors expanding in the business (e.g. Google and Amazon), its\nbusiness risk is particularly high. Wall Street analysts are increasingly questioning the growth potential of\nthe company’s flagship daily-discounted deals business, since its customer base may have limited ability to\ngrow in the future. Consequently, the company’s business risk, as measured by its asset volatility shown in\nFigure 6, has risen significantly since March 2012, and currently stands at 51.59%. Its asset volatility is in the\n75th percentile of its industry peer group, placing it among the higher risk companies on that single credit risk\nmetric.\n5 17 AUGUST 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nSummary\nSince Groupon reported a fourth-quarter 2011 loss of USD 9.8 million on an adjusted basis, Moody’s\nAnalytics’ public EDF measure had increased from 0.04% to 2.71% as of August 16, 2012. The sharp increase\nin its EDF measure was driven by changes in both its market leverage (financial risk) and asset volatility\n(business risk). Groupon’s market leverage level of 25.2% is currently among the highest in the internet\ninformation providers group, and twice the sector’s average. The gap between the default point and market\nvalue of assets has decreased from USD 17.4 billion to USD 3.3 billion in just six months. Historically, if the\nmarket value of assets falls below the company’s default point, it is assumed that the firm will not be able to\nsell assets or raise additional capital to pay its debt. Investors have become concerned that growth in\nGroupon’s core daily-discount deals business appears to have hit a wall, which is shown in the company’s\npoor performance in the equity market since March. Its share price is now 75% below its initial public\noffering price of USD 20 in November 2011. Asset volatility of the firm is trending among the 75th percentile\nof its industry peer group, suggesting that the current business model is relatively vulnerable to aggressive\ncompetitors.\n6 17 AUGUST 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nReport Number: 144847\nAuthors Contact Us\nSai Mao 1.212.553.1035 Americas : 1.212.553.4399\nsai.maro@moodys.com\nEurope: +44 (0) 20.7772.5588\nIrina Makarova 1.212.553.4307\nAsia: 813.5408.4131\nirina.makarova@moodys.com\n© Copyright 2012, Moody’s Capital Markets Research, Inc., and/or its licensors and affiliates (together, \"MOODY'S).
