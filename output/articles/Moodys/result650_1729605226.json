They\nhave commenced their journeys toward more sophisticated next-generation capabilities\nto manage a firm’s tolerance and capacity for risk taking.

To pacify the A\nconcerns of regulatory authorities, especially where the prevailing climate is on k\ns\nclient/investor protection and conduct vulnerabilities, risk appetite is often seen as a iR\n“stick” that has been used to force firms to improve the focus on key risk issues.

Beyond first generation efforts, the\nregulator and investor communities continue to expect firms to articulate risk appetite\nstatements that are not only understandable, actionable, comprehensive yet concise, but\nalso consistent with a firm’s strategic vision and operating reality.\nIn order to draw out and maximize value from risk appetite initiatives, two characteristics\nmust be at the forefront of on-going efforts to develop next-generation risk appetite\nmanagement capabilities.\n Link to strategy and growth. Firms must create tangible linkages to functions,\npersons, processes, and mechanisms that formulate and drive strategy and growth\nfor the firm (i.e., align and optimize the “engine” that informs and enables business\nand risk strategies).\nGroup risk appetite should be integrated into the budgeting and planning\ndeliberations. Group RAS is translated into tangible metrics, such as risk-adjusted\nreturns, impairments, and Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) to provide guidelines and\nformal constraints on individual businesses and subsidiaries in planning processes\nand lending decisions.\nStress testing should be aligned with risk appetite so that risk appetite metrics,\nsuch as returns expectations and solvency levels, are meaningfully defined and\ny\ncalibrated in the context of stressed scenarios. a\nS\nCompensation and incentives must be brought in line with roles that make or u\no\ncontrol decisions around risk and return. These include accounting for capital and Y\nliquidity risk charges in performance management and incorporating compensation\nta\nh\nknockouts for breaches in risk and compliance requirements. W\no\nD\n Link to business operations. Firms must also give clear expression to RAS by d n\na\nensuring a palpable link to business operations (i.e., by aligning and establishing\no\n“braking, safety, and contingency” mechanisms by which a firm executes its risk D\ncontrolling functions). u\no\nY\nFirms should focus on forward-looking, “predictive” metrics and proxies—for both ta\nfinancial and non-financial risks (reputation, conduct risks), and proactively use h\nW\nfinancial and behavioral analytics\ny\na\nRisk appetite should be linked to most business processes, with established\nS\ngovernance, oversight, and breach management\n:s\ns\ne\nn\n“Level 2” BU and division-specific risk appetite statements and paradigms should d\ne\nbe developed, and limits and risk measures should be rolled out and tightly aligned tc\nwith group risk appetite e n\nn\no\nRisk measures/limits should be embedded in key business decision IT applications C\nand “control/feedback loop” should be mostly automated. c\nig\ne\nta\nIn this regard, as firms continue the journey to embed what is articulated in their RAS in a r tS\ntangible manner, a cohesive strategic vision for risk appetite is important. The paramount :r\ne\nconsideration, however, is the implementation and execution of risk appetite, and how it tp\nmanifests itself tangibly in day-to-day activities. In other words, the essence of what is a\nh\ninside a firm’s RAS should inform and drive both planning and execution activities. C\n5COVERING ALL BASES: THE IMPERATIVE OF MAKING RISK APPETITE\nINITIATIVES TANGIBLE\nWhen designing work streams to implement risk appetite frameworks, firms must\nincorporate four concurrent considerations to ensure that risk appetite initiatives yield\ntangible outcomes. These broadly fall into four categories: Risk Appetite Statements\n(RAS); Risk Culture, Business Applications, and Risk Information; and Risk-Enabled\nDecisions and Execution.\nRisk Appetite\nIn many ways, this particular building block is the most “straightforward” task to define\nupfront. A firm’s risk appetite, or, in its articulated form, its Risk Appetite Statement\n(RAS), represents the firm’s willingness to take risks against a backdrop of known and\nassumed tolerances. It should be embodied in the company’s organizational values and\ncompliance expectations. The group level Risk Appetite Statement clarifies the risks that\nthe group is prepared to accept and manage in the pursuit of its objectives, as well as\nthose that it does not. As risk appetite initiatives mature and undergo multiple iterations\ntoward next-generation management capabilities, BU and division-specific risk appetite\nstatements and paradigms can be further developed, and limits and risk measures can\nbe rolled out and tightly aligned with group risk appetite.\nFigure 3: Risk Appetite Framework and Lifecycle: Covering All the Bases\ny\na\nS\nu\no\nY\nta\nh\nW\no\nD\nd\nn\na\no\nD\nu\no\nY\nta\nh\nW\ny\na\nS\n:s\ns\ne\nn\nd\ne\ntc\ne\nn\nn\no\nC\nSource: Celent\nc\nig\ne\nta\nRisk Culture r\ntS\nA company’s risk appetite should be aligned with, but is distinct from, its risk culture. Risk\nculture is inherently a human issue. A practical definition of risk culture relates to how\n:r\ne\nindividuals and teams in an organization behave in relation to risk issues—both the day-\ntp\na\nto-day and business-critical risks. h C\n6In the context of organizations, corporations, and institutions, inappropriately diagnosed\nor poorly designed risk culture initiatives often employ superficial analysis of the\nsymptoms and give in to demands for a quick fix approach. The result tends to be a\ngeneric action plan that does not address or even understand the underlying cause of the\nrisk culture issues. In concrete terms, these programs often use only benchmarking tools\nfor diagnosis. In contrast, more effective risk culture programs use a more targeted\napproach to understand the issues before creating the right risk culture for an\norganization.\nFrom many programs however, the assessment of an organization’s risk culture is\nchallenging because culture is complex, non-uniform, and influenced by many factors. A\nmature risk culture is not necessarily a more risk averse culture, because informed risk\ntaking is an important and necessary element for financial services firms and the financial\nsystem as a whole. In contrast, a truly mature risk culture shapes consistent behaviors\namong an organization’s people concerning awareness, understanding, risk appetite,\nposition-taking, and management of the risks themselves. In essence, risk culture is how\npeople behave toward risk issues when no one is looking.\nBusiness Applications and Risk Information\nThis dimension involves incorporating (“translating”) what is “on paper” into the business\napplications and data that are used to support risk-based decisions. Over time, we expect\nthat the governance, monitoring, and management of risk appetite will need to be\nincreasingly linked with various front-line operational processes, controls, and limits, such\nas core applications and associated risk systems (where day-to-day transactional\ndecisions around lending, trading, and investing are made).\nBusiness applications, data, and processes will need to be enhanced to capture and\ncalculate up-to-date risks and RAS metrics associated with a firm’s balance sheet,\nbusiness mix, franchise, and reputation. Firms will also need to enhance and calibrate y\na\nprocesses and data to detect, report, and control (soft and hard) breaches in relation to S\nthe group risk appetite boundaries, as well as country-level or business line limits and u\no\nmetrics, in a timely manner. Y\nta\nh\nEven if current linkages do not cover all aspects of the RAS and its metrics, firms must at W\nleast have a roadmap to gradually “link in” relevant data and applications over time. o\nD\nd\nn\nRisk-Enabled Decisions and Execution a\nDriven by regulatory drivers and lessons from the last financial crisis, the o\nD\noperationalization of risk appetite management activities require not just one-off\nu\n“statements of intent” and risk assessments, but also the continuous embedding of RAS o Y\nmetrics in a joint-up and “live” manner as part of a firm’s front-line business-as-usual ta\nconduct, actions, and decision processes. h\nW\ny\na\nForward-thinking firms emphasize the linking of RAS metrics between group and S\nbusiness unit level stakeholders to create pre-deal checks, regular dashboards, and “in- :s\ns\ntime” early warning alerts in a dynamic and integrated manner. In our experience, this is e\nn\nthe area where most firms struggle—in establishing a dynamic link between their risk d\ne\nappetite statements to the day-to-day decisions and the actions of individuals across the tc\nfirm. e n\nn\no\nC\nc\nig\ne\nta\nr\ntS\n:r\ne\ntp\na\nh\nC\n7MAKING IT REAL: LEVERS FOR SUCCESS\nAs firms look to strengthen their risk appetite frameworks, regulators look for tangible\nevidence that risk appetite is firmly embedded into the fabric of an organization’s thinking,\nculture, and operations. At the same time, firms that are undergoing their first generation\nefforts now look for ways to evolve their risk appetite framework toward more\nsophisticated approaches and to gain a better understanding of the value drivers of\nbusiness segments and products. Whatever the stage, change efforts to “make it real”\nare often the biggest hurdles for firms to overcome due to the multi-faceted nature of\nhaving influence across groups, individuals, culture, processes, and systems.\nIn order to navigate successfully toward desired outcomes, firms can exploit the following\nlevers:\n1. Drive operationalization efforts through a centrally managed project office to\nensure coordination and consistency. Firms need to establish central “PMO”\nresponsibilities to oversee and coordinate efforts to embed risk appetite frameworks\ninto processes, limits, and policies, as well as to ensure consistent quality of\nmethodology, data, and implementation approaches. Additionally, given the potential\nimpact on business plans and activities, firms must not underestimate the “political”\nramifications and organizational challenges to embedding risk appetite. All of these\nneed to be proactively managed and diffused by this centralized project function.\n2. Employ pragmatic approaches to generate quick wins and maximize impact\nwhen embedding and operationalizing risk appetite. Although risk appetite\ndefinition exercises serve to raise senior management awareness of risk issues,\nsimply having a group-level risk appetite statement of the desired aggregate risk\nprofile will not by itself help the organization take the “right” risks in a well-managed\ny\nmanner. For risk appetite frameworks to make a real impact, the top-down desired a\nS\nrisk profile must be compared with the bottom-up reality—this is where “the rubber\nu\nmeets the road.” o\nY\nta\nFigure 4: Risk Appetite Management: Cascading and Embedding Risk Appetite h\nW\no\nD\nd\nn\na\no\nD\nu\no\nY\nta\nh\nW\ny\na\nS\n:s\ns\ne\nn\nd\ne\ntc\ne\nn\nn\no\nC\nc\nig\ne\nta\nr\nSource: Celent tS\n:r\ne\nHowever, despite the progress made in the last few years, many firms still struggle tp\nto establish a tangible link between their risk appetite statements and the day-to-day a\nh\ndecisions and actions of individuals across the organization. To realize these C\n8ambitions, firms must align and link three main mechanisms concurrently to embed\nRisk Appetite across decision-making processes and governance activities. They\nrequire: linkages into corporate level strategy, planning, and budgeting; linkages into\nlimits framework at business unit level, and finally, embedding risk appetite into\nselected internal and external processes that affect the risk profile of a firm and\ntherefore could challenge the boundaries of a firm’s risk appetite.\nWhere possible, firms should employ pragmatic approaches designed to generate\nquick wins and maximize impact when embedding and operationalizing risk appetite,\nrather than pursuing longer, more ambitious “cycles of change.” For instance, it is\nmore pragmatic to “link” Risk Appetite metrics to existing limit frameworks. In most\ncases, cascading multiple metrics to the front-line is not practical because, first,\nmany metrics cannot be disaggregated to transaction or decision-level. Second, it\nbecomes challenging for front line staff to manage to multiple different metrics, and a\nhard push from group to the front line could risk confusion and rejection from\nstakeholders.\nIt is therefore more practical to identify existing front-line limits/policies and develop\na methodology for linking them to group-level metrics. Firms must also recognize\nthat the robustness of these existing limits and processes may also need to be\nreviewed (data, methodology, governance, and infrastructure). In some cases,\nexisting limit frameworks may not be sufficiently robust and so will require upgrading.\nThe approach and methodology for linking and embedding will differ for each group\nmetric/risk type. Each should be developed in conjunction with stakeholders that\n“own” and maintain the current limit frameworks.\n3. Adopt incremental approaches and iterate rather than attempting to “boil the\nocean.” Based on our experience, attempting to link/cascade all metrics to the y\na\nlowest level across the whole organization makes the firm prone to “political” change S\nmanagement issues. For instance, one may look to start incrementally by cascading u\no\ndown RAS metrics into limits based on the stressed outputs of selected “hot spot” Y\nsectors (e.g., real estate, retail/consumer goods, technology sectors) or,\nta\nh\nalternatively, based on the impact of an industry-specific shock on one RAS metric W\n(e.g., the impact of a real estate price shock on earnings-at-risk [EaR]). o\nD\nd\nA roadmap should be put in place to evolve, align, and incorporate relevant metrics n\na\non an incremental basis beyond merely “one-off” risk appetite framework projects. o\nD\nHowever, firms must avoid an overly regimented and onerous approach without\nu\nproper cost-benefit considerations when pursuing efforts to operationalize risk o\nY\nappetite frameworks.\nta\nh\nW\n4. Evolve business unit metrics to be in line with group risk appetite measures\ny\nover time. More often than not, disconnects develop between the metrics used in a\nS\nGroup Risk Appetite statements and those used to manage business on a day-to-\n:s\nday basis. For instance, group may employ solvency ratios, whereas day-to-day s\ne\nmanagement of credit portfolios may be based on exposure or expected loss (EL). n\nd\ne\nOver time, notwithstanding the organizational and methodological complexities tc\ne\ninvolved, firms must still look to rationalize and achieve consistency between top- n\nn\ndown/group, and bottom-up/business entity measures. o\nC\nBusiness unit/entity risk appetite statements need to encapsulate metrics most c ig\nrelevant for the specific entities, but have a clear link to group risk appetite e\nta\nstatements. This implies a need for mechanisms to allocate and communicate risk r\ntS\nresources consumed by BUs on a regular basis.\n:r\ne\ntp\nThe aim here is to determine the appropriate mix and number of metrics used, to a\nh\ncustomize for specific lines of business, to define/agree on methodological changes C\n9required to cascade group and business-line risk appetite, and to sequence tactical\nexecution and communications required to implement the roadmap for embedding\nthe risk appetite framework into business processes, such as budgeting/planning,\nperformance management, compensation, and stress testing.\n5. Institutionalize risk appetite management to become a “living and breathing”\npart of the organization, with business-as-usual ownership across the\nlifecycle. The risk appetite framework—from the lifecycle of appetite setting,\nstrategy, calculation/quantification monitoring, and reporting—must be clearly\narticulated and assigned, with various stages and dimensions appropriated to the\nright owners, with a regular refinement and review processes. As Figure 5 illustrates,\nfor each statement in the risk appetite, responsibilities need to be assigned at a\ngranular level, and a metric reporting owner must be identified.\nFigure 5: Risk Appetite Management Lifecycle: Making It Real (Illustrative)1\ny\na\nS\nu\no\nY\nta\nh\nW\no\nD\nd\nn\na\no\nSource: Celent D\nu\no\nWhere possible, firms should exploit synergies across compliance, operational risk, Y\nERM, and other management information-reporting initiatives to gather, consolidate, ta\nh\nand enhance KPI/KRI information, as well as to apply common data sourcing, W\ninterfacing, and data quality management standards to metrics production and y\na\nreporting processes.

Whenever possible, firms should look\nto employ workflow and case management tools to report and track open breach\nincidences, as well as to drive mitigation plans and actions.\n7. Address gaps in supporting Management Information Systems (MIS)\ninfrastructure in a balanced and systemic manner. The main obstacle often y\na\nfaced by firms in risk appetite monitoring and reporting stems from siloed “sources of S\ntruth,” originating from the disconnect between MIS, finance, risk, and other u o\nY\noperational systems. We observe several mistakes that firms typically fall into. On\none end of the spectrum, firms “indefinitely tolerate” inadequate systems and gaps in\nta\nh\ndata that play an important role for the provision of information to monitor and report W\nrisk taking against risk appetite. These result in a lack of timeliness or inaccuracies o\nD\nin governance reporting. On the other end, firms overemphasize the need to d\nn\ncompletely resolve systems and reporting issues over practical (interim) a\nworkarounds. These result in delays to achieving the organizational benefits of o\nD\ncascading risk appetite measures early (even without all the technology and data u\no\npieces fully in place). At the extreme, there are firms that have considerably poor IT Y\ninfrastructure, which give the board and management limited visibility into actual or ta\npotential breaches due to limited embedding of risk appetite into business h W\nprocesses.\ny\na\nS\nIn the light of these scenarios, firms should look to review and prioritize the most :s\ns\nimportant risk appetite metrics against business unit processes and source systems e\nn\nto determine which areas require fixing or enhancements (i.e., finance, risk, and d\ne\nother operational infrastructure used to measure and monitor thresholds). tc\ne\nn\nn\no\nC\nc\nig\ne\nta\nr\ntS\n:r\ne\ntp\na\nh\nC\n11What should a best practice risk appetite framework\ncomprise?\nFirst, a cohesive and clearly articulated group level Risk\nAppetite Statement (RAS) should clarify risks that the\ngroup is prepared to accept and manage in the pursuit of\nits objectives, as well as those that it does not. This can\neventually also include BU and division-specific risk\nappetite statements, and paradigms can be developed at\ngreater granularity, with limits and risk measures rolled\nout and tightly aligned with group risk appetite.\nSecondly, RAS should be aligned with, but is distinct\nKey from, its risk culture. A truly mature risk culture shapes\nResearch consistent behaviors among an organization’s people\nQuestion concerning awareness, understanding, risk appetite,\n2 position-taking, and managing risks themselves.\nThe third dimension involves incorporating (“translating”)\nwhat is “on paper” into the business applications and\ndata that are used to support risk-based decisions, to\nensure that these are able to capture, calculate, and\ncalibrate up-to-date risks and RAS metrics associated\nwith a firm’s balance sheet, business mix, franchise, and\nreputation.\nThe fourth dimension involves the day-to-day linking of\ny\na\nRAS metrics and processes between group- and S\nbusiness unit-level stakeholders, through mechanisms u\no\nY\nlike pre-deal checks, regular dashboards, and “in-time”\nta\nearly warning alerts in a dynamic and integrated manner. h\nW\nIn our experience, this is the area where most firms\no\nstruggle to establish a dynamic link between their risk D\nappetite statements and the day-to-day decisions and d n\na\nactions of individuals across the firm.\no\nD\nu\no\nY\nta\nh\nW\ny\na\nS\n:s\ns\ne\nn\nd\ne\ntc\ne\nn\nn\no\nC\nc\nig\ne\nta\nr\ntS\n:r\ne\ntp\na\nh\nC\n12CLOSING THOUGHTS\nIn the current environment, both investors and regulators expect more evidence from\nfirms that the board and senior managers are actively engaged in the oversight and\ngovernance of the firm’s risk appetite framework. The emphasis is typically to ensure\nthat a firm’s risk appetite initiatives do not become academic, tick-box exercises where\none “preaches one thing, but does something else.”\nAs corporate scandals and conduct-related effects continue to manifest years after the\nlast financial crisis, the divergence between “what you say” and “what you do” is\nincreasingly unpalatable. This is demonstrated by the fact that firms that are caught up in\nbehavior-related corporate debacles are often slapped with hefty regulatory fines and\nsignificant declines in market capitalization.\nThe flip side is also true. In the longer-term, firms that are consistent in what they say and\ndo attract “positive multiples” in valuations and good will. These subsequently decrease\nthe drag of regulatory fines and remediation efforts and increase firms’ ability to raise\ncapital. In this regard, there are tangible benefits to managing risk appetite\neffectively. Could we return to the “good old days” where the general public as a whole\nvalued virtue and conduct? It certainly looks that way.\nWhat does next-generation risk appetite paradigms look like?\nNext-generation paradigms will have the following\ncharacteristics. First, the focus will be on forward-\nlooking, “predictive” metrics and proxies—for both\nfinancial and non-financial risks (reputation, conduct\nKey\nrisks)—and proactive use of financial and behavioral\nResearch\nanalytics.\nQuestion\n3\nSecond, risk appetite will be linked to most business\nprocesses, including established governance, oversight,\nand breach management.\nThird, at the BU and division levels, risk appetite\nstatements and paradigms will be developed and limits\nand risk measures rolled out and tightly aligned with\ngroup risk appetite.\nFinally, risk measures and limits are embedded in key\nbusiness-decision IT applications, and “limits/breach s th\nreporting feedback loop” will be automated. g\nu\no\nh\nT\ng\nn\nis\no\nlC\nWas this report useful to you?
