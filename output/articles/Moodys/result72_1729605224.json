The model\nconsists of a single, simultaneous system of structural economic equations that allow for a variety of cross-\ncountry interactions through demand, price and financial market linkages. The model equations are all specified\naccording to established macroeconomic theory, with parameters estimated econometrically using historical\ndata. A baseline and a number of alternative scenario forecasts are produced at a quarterly frequency, extending\nover a 30-year time horizon. These forecasts are updated each month to retain consistency with the most recent\navailable economic data, and are used as inputs to a range of additional Moody’s Analytics products, including\nsubnational, housing and credit market forecasts (see Chart 2).\nThe historical data series forecast in the vide breakdowns by geographical region (for across thousands of global series quickly\nmodel are sourced directly from national example, South America, Europe) and by and efficiently.\nstatistical offices wherever possible, to income (developing versus developed Asia, The model consists of separate blocks\nensure that the forecasts reflect the most for instance), as well as groupings reflecting of equations capturing relationships across\naccurate and timely information avail- major institutional arrangements such as the series within each national economy, inter-\nable.
