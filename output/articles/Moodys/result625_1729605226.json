This measurement model has become known as the Variable Fee\nApproach (VFA), referring to the fact that such contracts characterized by a variable fee that\nContact Us\nthe entity charges in exchange for investment-related services.

This paper discusses the key\n+81.3.5408.4100 criteria and how they could be assessed using stochastic scenarios.\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com\nWhat does the standard say?\nIFRS 17 Paragraph B101 provides a definition of insurance contracts with direct participation\nfeatures:\na. The contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly\nidentified pool of underlying items;\nb. The entity expects to pay the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the\nfair value returns on the underlying items; and\nc. The entity expects a substantial proportion of any changes in the amount to be paid to\nthe policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\nParagraph 107 provides further guidance as to the interpretation of the characteristics set out\nin Paragraph 101(b) and 101(c). In particular, according to Paragraph 107(b), an entity shall:\nAssess the variability in the amounts in paragraphs B101(b) and B101(c):\ni. Over the duration of the group of insurance contracts; and\nii. On a present value probability-weighted average basis, not a best, or worst outcome\nbasis.\nParagraph B108 goes on to discuss the different outcomes that might arise for products\ncontaining guarantees, depending on whether the guarantee bites in the particular scenario.\n1 Profit Emergence under IFRS 17: The Variable Fee Approach, Steven Morrison, Moody’s Analytics (November 2018)\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2018/profit-emergence-under-ifrs17-vfa\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS TO ASSESS VFA ELIGIBILITY 01Scenario-based modeling\nParagraphs B107(ii) and B108 acknowledge that different scenarios can have different outcomes in terms of the returns on underlying\nitems and the policyholders’ share in these returns, and that assessment of the criteria set out in Paragraphs 101(b) and 101(c) should\nallow for this.\nThe use of scenarios to assess VFA eligibility has previously been described in an article by Hallema,2 who suggests potential metrics\nfor assessing policyholder share and variability and quantifies these metrics under three different hand-picked scenarios for the return\non underlying items. In this paper, we adopt a similar approach, but use a much-larger number of stochastic scenarios to quantify\npolicyholder share and variability.\nThe use of stochastic scenarios in this context might appear daunting in terms of operational and computational effort. However,\nalthough not prescribed in the standard, stochastic modeling techniques are expected to be widely used in the calculation of\nfulfilment cash flows for contracts with participation features anyway (see, for example, Paragraphs B37-B38). So the additional effort\nrequired to use stochastic scenarios to assess VFA eligibility might be quite manageable.\nDescription of example contract\nThe illustrative contract group considered here consists of 100 contracts, with a coverage period of 10 years and a single premium of\nCU 150 per policy received immediately when the contracts are issued. In return, the contract provides the following benefits:\n» On death during the coverage period: The account balance, subject to a guaranteed minimum death benefit. We assume that one\npolicyholder dies each year.\n» On survival until the end of the coverage period: The account balance, subject to a guaranteed minimum maturity benefit.\nAt inception, the account balance is equal to premiums paid, and subsequently evolves each year based on returns on an equity fund,\nsubject to an annual charge to reflect investment services provided3. The annual charge is a fixed percentage of the account balance at\nthe end of the year (prior to paying any benefits).\nWe assume that this contract satisfies the requirement that the policyholder participates in a clearly identified pool of items (the\naccount balance). The question we investigate is whether the level and variability of this participation meets the requirements set out\nin Paragraphs B101(b) and B101(c).\nEligibility metrics\nTo assess the criteria in Paragraphs B101(b) and B101(c), we must define metrics that quantify the policyholders’ share of the fair value\nreturns on the underlying items and its variability.\nOne of the challenges with interpreting Paragraph 101(b) is that it refers to the policyholders’ share of the fair value returns. However,\nfor many contracts, including the one considered here, the payments to both policyholders and the entity are expressed in terms of\nthe current value of the underlying items, rather than fair value returns.\nNote that each year the account balance evolves according to:\nAccountBalance(t)=AccountBalance(t-1)+FairValueReturn(t)\n- EntityCashFlow(t)-PolicyholderCashFlow(t)\nRearranging:\n2 VFA eligibility assessment methodology, E. Hallema, de actuaris (October 2018)\n3 The contract is based on that described in Example 9 of “Illustrative examples on IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts” (IFRS Foundation, May 2017) but with modifications to the\nassumed coverage period and size of annual charges. Here we also assume a minimum guaranteed benefit at maturity as well as on death.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS TO ASSESS VFA ELIGIBILITY 02In general, AccountBalance(t)≠AccountBalance(t-1) so the fair value return each year doesn’t naturally decompose into payments\nto the policyholder & the entity. Part of the payments each year can be attributed to the account balance at the end of the previous\nyear, while some of the account balance is retained to be paid in future years.\nHowever, the account balance is completely distributed at maturity of the contract. Summing over all years up to T=10 years and\nrearranging shows that the sum of fair value returns conveniently breaks down into two terms, the sum of cash flows to the entity and\nsum of cash flows to policyholders4:\nAs noted above, different scenarios will result in different outcomes in terms of the returns on underlying items and the cash flows to\npolicyholders. Taking the expectation over all economic scenarios gives5:\nSo one possible measure of the policyholders’ share of fair value returns on the underlying items is:\nThis metric measures the share over the duration of the contact group, so would appear to satisfy the requirement in Paragraph\n107(b)(i). Furthermore, the use of probability-weighted averages would appear to at least partly satisfy the requirement in Paragraph\n107(b)(ii).\nNote that Paragraph B107(b)(ii) refers to a present value probability-weighted average basis, while the metric proposed in Equation 2\nis based on undiscounted values. The problem with taking present values is that, as noted above, each year the fair value return do not\nnaturally decompose into payments to the policyholder & the entity. If we discount Equation 1 using a cash account, before summing\nover the coverage period, we find:\nSo the sum of discounted fair value returns can’t be fully attributed to the policyholder & the entity, unless CashRate(t-1)=0 at all\ntimes. As a result, in this paper we choose to work metrics based on undiscounted values.\n4 Note that, assuming the account balance is completely distributed at the end of year 10, we have\n5 Here, E[…] denotes the average calculated over all economic scenarios considered.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS TO ASSESS VFA ELIGIBILITY 03Considering B101(c), there is a further requirement to quantify the extent to which changes in the amount to be paid to the\npolicyholder varies with the change in fair value of the underlying items. For the contract considered here, the presence of guaranteed\nbenefits means that the total cash flow paid to policyholders is bounded below by some positive amount. In such scenarios, the\npolicyholders’ cash flows can be considered fixed and independent of the return on underlying items, while in all other scenarios the\ncash flows vary with the returns on underlying items.\nTherefore, one possible measure of variability is the probability that the sum of policyholders’ cash flows exceeds the minimum:6\nNote that these metrics for policyholders’ share and variability are just examples and other metrics might be possible.\nVFA eligibility assessment of example contract\nHere, we estimate the two VFA eligibility metrics for the example contract group described above, under different variations of the\ncontract features. Metrics are estimated using 1,000 stochastic scenarios for the return on underlying items, generated using a “real-\nworld” calibration of the Moody’s Analytics Economic Scenario Generator.\nContract 1: Minimum death benefit = 170; Minimum maturity benefit = 0; Charges = 0.5% p.a.\nFirst, we consider a contract that has a minimum death benefit of CU 170 but no guarantee at maturity. As the level of guaranteed\nbenefits provided are relatively small, the contract is profitable with a relatively modest annual charge (0.5% p.a.). Figure 1 shows\nthe sum of all cash flows to policyholders plotted against the sum of all fair value returns on underlying items, in all 1,000 stochastic\nscenarios.\nThe dashed lines show the averages of the sum of cash flows to policyholders (the numerator in Equation 2) and the sum of fair value\nreturns (the denominator in Equation 2), with the solid red line indicating y=x. The closeness of the intersection of the dashed lines to\nthe solid line indicates the level of the policyholders share.\n6 Here, Prob[…] denotes the proportion over all economic scenarios considered, and Min(…) denotes the minimum over all economic scenarios considered.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS TO ASSESS VFA ELIGIBILITY 04Figure 1: Sum of policyholder cash flows vs. sum of fair value returns (Contract 1)\nIn this example, the average sum of policyholders’ cash flow is estimated as CU 7,464 compared to an average sum of investment\nreturns of CU 8,172. The policyholders’ share is therefore estimated as 91%.\nThe minimum sum of policyholders’ cash flows, estimated over all 1,000 scenarios, is CU -10,682. This value is measured in just one\nscenario (i.e., the sum of policyholder cash flows in 999 scenarios is strictly greater than this), so the variability metric (Equation 3) is\nestimated as 99.9%.\nThe reason for such a high variability in this case is due to the fact that guarantees are only provided on death. With only one death\nper year, a significant component of the total policyholders’ cash flow is the maturity benefit, which is equal to the outstanding\naccount balance with no minimum guarantee. The theoretical minimum sum of policyholders’ cash flows (CU -13,300) is never\nachieved as it would require the account balance being completely wiped out by year 10.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS TO ASSESS VFA ELIGIBILITY 05Contract 2: Guaranteed death benefit = 170; Guaranteed maturity benefit = 150; Charges = 4% p.a.\nWe now consider a contract which has a minimum maturity benefit of CU 150 in addition to the guaranteed death benefit of CU 170.\nA significantly larger annual charge is assumed (4% p.a.), to cover the additional cost of providing the maturity guarantee.\nFigure 2 shows the sum of all cash flows to policyholders plotted against the sum of all fair value returns on underlying items, in all\n1,000 stochastic scenarios.\nFigure 2: Sum of policyholder cash flows vs. sum of fair value returns (Contract 2)\nIn this example, the average sum of policyholders’ cash flow is estimated as CU 3,488 compared to an average sum of investment\nreturns of CU 6,863. The policyholders’ share is therefore estimated as 51%.\nThe minimum sum of policyholders’ cash flows, estimated over all 1,000 scenarios, is CU 200. This is the theoretically minimum\namount, corresponding to all 10 death guarantees biting as well as the maturity guarantee. This minimum sum of cash flows is\nmeasured in 329 of the 1,000 stochastic scenarios used, resulting a variability metric of 67%.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS USING STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS TO ASSESS VFA ELIGIBILITY 06Discussion\nIn this paper, we have described the use of stochastic scenarios to assess whether an insurance contract qualifies as a contract with\ndirect participation features, according to criteria set out in IFRS 17. As with other decisions in the standard, the criteria for VFA\neligibility are not precisely defined and leave room for interpretation by individual entities.\nIn this paper, we have defined candidate metrics that might be used to quantify the degree of participation as a share of the returns\non underlying items (the policyholders’ share) and the extent to which variation in underlying items results in variation in policyholder\ncash flows (the variability). According to Paragraphs 101(b) and 101(c), both measures must be “substantial” to qualify for\nthe VFA.\nNote that these metrics for policyholders’ share and variability are just examples and other metrics are possible. The metrics\nintroduced here, and similar metrics, are also sensitive to subjective assumptions embedded in the scenarios used to calculate\nthem, in particular the assumed growth rates on underlying items. It is quite plausible that different entities could assess that\nsimilar contracts have different degrees of policyholder share and variability simply because they have used different metrics and\nassumptions.\nThe paper illustrates measurement of the example metrics for a contract with policyholder participation in underlying items subject\nto minimum guarantees. Two variations on the contract are analysed, with varying levels of annual charges and guarantees offered.\nWhether the resulting numbers are “substantial” is a further element of subjectivity. Although it is a judgment of individual entities,\nconsensus as to appropriate thresholds might emerge as entities progress with their IFRS 17 preparations.\nCONTACT DETAILS\nVisit us at moodysanalytics.com or contact us at a location below.\nAMERICAS EMEA ASIA (EXCLUDING JAPAN) JAPAN\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com clientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\n© 2019 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
