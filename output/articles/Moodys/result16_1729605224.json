Orbit utilizes\nmachine learning algorithms to derive price predictions\nin the trading market. Sold by subscription and available\nas a white-box solution suite called Orbit QuantLab,\nOrbit’s unique value proposition is its ability to consume\nand analyze unstructured data from published text\nfound in news, filings and reports to deliver customized\ntrading ‘signals’ for more informed decision making.\nSince its inception, Orbit has expanded to serve\nboth the buy and sell sides of the trading business to\nmodel equities, commodities, FX, government bonds,\ncorporate bonds of unlisted companies and derivatives.\nOrbit vs. others in the data modeling space\nOther vendors operating in this space offer sentiment analysis of unstructured or ‘semantic’ data to predict events\nand inform decision making. But many go to market as black box companies to hide internal logic. Whereas, Orbit’s\nbusiness model is built for flexible and transparent data modeling to enable its clients to establish trading strategy\ncriteria and select data sets in the production of interpretable trading signals.Moving from\nDIY data feeds\nto a CaaS model\n“Orbit can consume and analyze all kinds of unstructured data and is\nspecifically designed for asset management and capital market clients -\nboth of which are focused on improving profit or lowering operational costs,”\nsaid Founder Da Wei.\nWith emphasis on price prediction via AI-powered text analytics, Orbit\ninitially assembled a team of experts to crawl and collect news data.\nHowever, the team soon realized that by switching to Content-as-a-Service\n(CaaS) technology on the front end, it could shift more of its resources to\nOrbit’s core value prop: data analysis.\n“We built our own application to stream information from real-time news.\n“ NewsEdge already\nSeveral years ago, we engaged with Moody’s Analytics NewsEdge™ in order\ndoes the hard work of\nto focus our effort on data analysis.

Without NewsEdge, we’d have to buy the historical data we need from a\nvendor.”\nDa Wei continues, “With this flexible data set, we can focus analysis on our clients’ areas of interest without having\nto write crawlers for data collection and pre-processing. It’s more efficient to focus on the trading criteria and data\nthat our clients want than to normalize data we don’t use. For example, if we’re focused in Southeastern Asia, we can\nselect the websites we want by region, language and country and easily filter what we want to consume.”\nUsing NewsEdge to build our count model for price prediction prepares us to expand\nthe news coverage from 400 websites to 4,000 when we need to.
