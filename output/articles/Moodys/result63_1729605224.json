Odds that lawmakers blunder either out of intent or ineptness are uncomfortably high.\nThe Treasury debt limit, which puts a statutory cap on the amount of Treasury debt outstanding and the\nability of the Treasury to issue securities to fund government obligations, was hit on January 19 (see Chart\n1). Treasury must now use “extraordinary measures” to come up with the additional cash needed to pay its\nbills, but those measures will be exhausted by no later than early October. If not resolved by then, someone\nwill not get paid in a timely way.

Global financial markets and the\neconomy would be upended. Even if it is quickly resolved, Americans likely would pay for this default for\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit brinkmanship (again) 2generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been\npoliticized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To\ncompensate for this risk, investors will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury securities they pur-\nchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the econ-\nomy, significantly diminishing it.\nDebt limit countdown\nThe Treasury debt limit, also known as the debt ceiling, is the maximum amount of debt that the Treasury\ncan issue to the public or to other federal agencies. The amount is set by law and has been increased or\nsuspended many times over the years to allow the Treasury to finance government operations. The original\nintent of the debt limit was to force lawmakers to remain fiscally disciplined. It has failed at this and instead\nhas become highly disruptive to the fiscal process.\nBrinkmanship over the debt limit has become increasingly common. The most recent battle occurred in late\n2021 when the limit was increased to its current $31.4 trillion. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced\nin a January 13 letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that the nation’s outstanding debt would hit its\nlimit on January 19, and that Treasury would have to engage in extraordinary measures to prevent a default\non the government’s obligations. But these measures will work for only so long, and while it is not possible\nto know precisely when the Treasury will default given the uncertainty in the timing of the federal govern-\nment’s payments and receipts, Secretary Yellen has said this could be as early as June. Our best estimate is\nthat the Treasury will run out of options in August but no later than early October.\nDebt limit workarounds\nThere is considerable debate over whether the Treasury could prioritize to pay Treasury securities investors\nfirst and thus avoid defaulting on its debt obligation. While the Treasury may have the technical ability to\npay bond investors before others—those payments are handled by the Fedwire payment system, while a\ndifferent computer system handles other government obligations—it is unclear that Treasury is legally able\nto do so. The move would be challenged in the courts. Bond investors, unsure of how this legal uncertainty\nwould be resolved, would demand a much higher interest rate in compensation. Moreover, politically it\nseems unimaginable that bond investors, including many foreign investors, would get their money ahead\nof American seniors, the military, or even the federal government’s electric bill for long.2 And there is the\nquestion of how all the other bills would be prioritized. It is not possible for the Treasury to sort through the\nblizzard of payments due each day. More likely, as outlined in a report by Treasury’s inspector general, the\nTreasury would delay all payments until it received enough cash to pay a given day’s bills.\nTreasury bond investors also know that other often-proposed workarounds to the debt limit, like minting\na $1 trillion platinum coin, would be unworkable. Federal law does give Treasury the authority to mint\nplatinum coins, and the thinking is that Treasury would mint a $1 trillion coin, deposit it at the Federal Re-\nserve, and draw it down to pay the government’s bills. But the law authorizing platinum coins envisaged\ncommemorative coins—not circumventing Congress’ power of the purse. This would also put the Fed in the\nmiddle of the battle, badly politicizing it, and thus significantly jeopardizing Fed independence, which is\ncritical to a well-functioning economy.\nAnother idea is to have Treasury issue premium bonds rather than par bonds as Treasury debt comes due,\nlowering the face amount of debt outstanding and subject to the debt limit. A simple example illustrates.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit brinkmanship (again) 3The seven-year Treasury bond is trading at 3.5%, and there is an upcoming auction for $35 billion in these\nsecurities. Suppose Treasury offers $35 billion face value of seven-year bonds at 5% instead. The bond\nmarket should price them at around 109% of par. This would bring in $38 billion in proceeds, which would\nretire $38 billion in Treasury debt, but only increase the debt subject to the limit by $35 billion for a net re-\nduction in debt subject to the limit of $3 billion. This could be scaled up by issuing even higher coupons, for\nexample the Treasury might bring in $14 billion with $35 billion of face value and a 10% coupon. Of course,\nthe present value of the Treasury’s debt obligation has not changed, so this is just a budget gimmick, but\nso too is the debt limit. While this is creative financial engineering, it is not something Treasury could roll\nout quickly, and it would be very costly to commit Treasury to higher and higher interest payments. It also\nthreatens the well-functioning of the Treasury bond market, the world’s largest and most liquid market.\nBesides, interest rates would likely still spike as investors view this chicanery as putting the nation’s fiscal\ndiscipline at risk.3\nYet another proposed workaround to the debt limit is to have the president invoke Section 4 of the 14th\nAmendment to order the Treasury to keep issuing bonds and paying the government’s bills. The 14th\nAmendment states that the “validity of the public debt of the United States…shall not be questioned.”\nIf push comes to shove, and lawmakers are about to breach the limit, a 14th Amendment declaration\nseems the most viable option since it highlights the sanctity of the nation’s debt. But Section 4 of the 14th\nAmendment was passed in the wake of the Civil War to ensure the federal government was not on the hook\nfor the war debt of the Confederate states. Investors would rightly wonder if using the amendment to abro-\ngate the debt limit law would stand up in the courts, and even if it did, what that would mean for our polit-\nical system’s checks and balances. Given the constitutional crisis this would set off, financial markets would\nstill be roiled, and a recession ensue.\nDespite these looming dark scenarios, financial markets have yet to react to the possibility of a government\ndefault. Of course, it is still months away and it has become standard practice for Congress to run down\nthe clock but, in the end, figure out a way to raise the debt limit when absolutely necessary. It is still widely\nexpected that this Congress will do so, although investors are much more wary after witnessing the chaotic\nprocess for choosing Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House and the rule changes for managing the leg-\nislative body that he acquiesced to in order to win the post. Passing legislation as politically charged as the\ndebt limit requires especially deft policymaking to corral the necessary votes. That seems a heavy lift for\nthis Congress.\nEconomic costs\nAs the deadline gets closer, global investors will rightly begin to worry that lawmakers will err and fail to act\nin time. Uncertainty will push interest rates higher and stock prices will fall, slowly at first but then more\nquickly. And if policymakers actually do fail to increase or suspend the limit before the Treasury runs out\nof cash and defaults on its obligations, interest rates will spike, and stock prices will crater with enormous\ncosts to taxpayers and the economy.\nThe magnitude of the potential economic costs is evident in the substantial costs associated with previous\ndebt limit episodes, even though lawmakers acted just in time. In 1979, the Treasury inadvertently missed\npayments on Treasury bills maturing that spring. The mishap was caused in part by fallout from a delay in\nraising the debt limit, but also by problems with payment processing equipment the Treasury used at the\ntime. Even though investors received their payments with only a small delay, Treasury bill yields jumped 60\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit brinkmanship (again) 4basis points and remained elevated for several months. The cost to taxpayers was ultimately estimated in\nthe tens of billions of dollars.\nThe Treasury came closest to a default in summer 2011, when that debt limit battle was part of the budget\nwars between the Obama administration and Republican-controlled Congress that raged in the wake of the\nglobal financial crisis. The brinkmanship around raising the debt limit was especially heated and Treasury\ndebt lost its AAA rating from credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s due to governance concerns raised by\nthe political dysfunction. Credit default swaps on Treasury securities—the cost of insuring against a default\nby the Treasury—spiked as high as 80 basis points on one-year Treasuries and 65 basis points on five-year\nTreasuries.4 In typical times, the cost of insuring against a Treasury bond default is less than 5 basis points\nfor one-year securities and 30 basis points for five-year securities.\nA Moody’s Analytics analysis of the 2013 debt limit battle showed that investor concerns over a Treasury\nbond default pushed 10-year Treasury yields up an estimated 6 to 12 basis points at the height of the\nangst.5 Short-term interest rates also jumped. Even though the Treasury ultimately did not default, and in-\nterest rates quickly declined, the episode likely cost taxpayers nearly a half-billion dollars in added interest,\nnot including the costs to households and businesses of higher interest rates on the funds they borrowed.\nWhile these costs were modest, they were unnecessarily incurred.\nDefault scenarios\nIf lawmakers are unable to resolve the debt limit in time and the Treasury begins paying its bills late and\ndefaults, financial markets would be roiled. A TARP moment seems likely, hearkening back to that dark\nday in autumn 2008 when Congress initially failed to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout of the\nbanking system, and the stock market and other financial markets cratered. A similar crisis, characterized\nby spiking interest rates and plunging equity prices, would be ignited. Short-term funding markets, which\nare essential to the flow of credit that helps finance the economy’s day-to-day activities, likely would shut\ndown as well.\nIt is unimaginable that lawmakers would allow things to get to this point, but as the TARP experience high-\nlights, they have done the unimaginable before. Yet, if that experience is a guide, lawmakers would quickly\nreverse course and resolve the debt limit impasse to allow the Treasury to resume issuing debt again and\npay its bills. Much damage will have already been done, and although markets would right themselves, it\nwould be too late for the already-fragile economy, and a recession would ensue.\nHowever, if lawmakers do not reverse course and the impasse drags on for even a few weeks, the hit to the\neconomy would be cataclysmic. Most immediately, the federal government would have to slash its spend-\ning. Say the debt limit was breached on October 1 and dragged on all month. The Treasury would have no\nchoice but to cut government spending by an estimated $125 billion. And if there is no agreement in No-\nvember, another close to $200 billion in spending would need to be cut. The hit to the economy as these\ngovernment spending cuts cascade through the economy would be overwhelming.\nAdding to the economic turmoil would be the loss of consumer, business and investor confidence. Political\nbrinkmanship over the operations of the federal government has been frightening for Americans to watch.\nIn both the 2011 and 2013 debt limit episodes, households were closely attuned to the political hardball be-\ning played in Washington, and consumer sentiment slumped. The brinkmanship is also unnerving for busi-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit brinkmanship (again) 5nesses, which will pull back on investment and hiring, and for financial institutions, which will quickly turn\nmore circumspect about extending credit to households and businesses.\nThe timing could not be worse for the economy; even before the specter of a debt limit breach, many CEOs\nand economists believe a recession is likely this year. With the Federal Reserve ramping up interest rates\nin an effort to quell wage and price pressures, avoiding a recession would be difficult even if nothing else\nwent wrong. Most leading indicators of recession, including the prescient policy yield curve—the difference\nbetween 10-year Treasury yield and the federal funds rate—point to recession beginning later this year at\nabout the time lawmakers will be doing battle over the limit.\nIt is difficult to envisage what steps policymakers would take to mitigate the economic damage. With law-\nmakers at loggerheads over the debt limit, it is unlikely they would agree on any fiscal support for the econ-\nomy in response to the crisis created by the breach of the debt limit, at least not quickly. The Fed would\nimmediately cut short-term rates back to the zero lower bound and ramp up its quantitative easing—pur-\nchases of Treasury bonds—but any benefit would likely be overwhelmed as global investors sold or stopped\nbuying U.S. securities.\nBased on simulations of the Moody’s Analytics model of the U.S. and global economies, the economic\ndownturn ensuing from a political impasse lasting even a few weeks would be comparable to that suffered\nduring the global financial crisis.6 That means real GDP would decline almost 4% peak to trough, nearly 6\nmillion jobs would be lost, and the unemployment rate would surge to over 7%. Stock prices would be cut\nalmost in one-third at the worst of the selloff, wiping out $12 trillion in household wealth. Treasury yields,\nmortgage rates, and other consumer and corporate borrowing rates would spike, at least until the debt\nlimit is resolved and Treasury payments resume. Even then, rates would not fall back to where they were\npreviously.7 Since Treasury securities no longer would be perceived as risk-free by global investors, future\ngenerations of Americans would pay a steep economic price.8\nWhat’s next\nIt is unclear how lawmakers will resolve the current impasse over the debt limit. Given the severe economic\nand political costs of a debt limit breach, the most likely path is for lawmakers to come to terms just in time\nto avoid it. This might include an agreement on the debt limit in tandem with an agreement on the federal\nbudget for fiscal 2024 that begins October 1. Coming to terms after much Sturm und Drang would be con-\nsistent with the long, arduous history of agreements on the debt limit—and fitting given the bipartisan na-\nture of the financial obligations the debt would cover.9 The 2024 budget could include enough government\nspending restraint and perhaps new budget process rules to satisfy enough Republicans to join most Dem-\nocrats to pass the legislation. Getting the legislation across the finish line will surely be messy and painful,\ncausing heightened volatility in financial markets, but lawmakers ultimately will get the job done before\nthere is significant economic damage.\nHaving said this, odds that lawmakers are unable to get it together and avoid a breach of the debt limit\nappear to be meaningfully greater than zero. The difficulty House Republicans had electing Kevin McCarthy\nas Speaker and the terms Speaker McCarthy had to agree to win election, including having a battle over\nthe debt limit with Democrats, do not augur well. Getting any legislation through the legislative process\nis tough under typical circumstances, but getting highly contentious debt limit legislation signed into law\nthrough this Congress before a breach is highly problematic. Adding to the concern is the growing number\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit brinkmanship (again) 6of mostly Republican lawmakers openly contemplating whether Treasury could navigate a breach of the\ndebt limit by prioritizing payments to bond holders. They may be earnest in their questioning of whether a\nbreach would lead to turmoil in financial markets and the economy along the lines articulated in this analy-\nsis, but they are badly misguided.\nThere is also reason to be worried that Wall Street is too sanguine about the political and procedural head-\nwinds to addressing the debt limit. Nonplussed investors believe they have seen this movie before many\ntimes and know how it ends. That is, after a bitter political back and forth, lawmakers will find a way to\ncome to terms before a breach. Therefore, interest rates would not rise and stock prices would not fall as\nthe debt limit deadline approaches, sending the wrong signals to lawmakers who are taking their cues from\ninvestors. Ironically, because investors seem so sanguine about how this drama will play out, policymakers\nmay believe they have nothing to worry about and fail to resolve the debt limit in time. This would be an\negregious error.\nConclusions\nA bedrock of the U.S. economy and global financial system is that the U.S. government pays what it owes in\na timely way.10 Political brinkmanship over the debt limit is thus painful to watch. If lawmakers are unable\nto increase, suspend or eliminate the debt limit before the Treasury fails to make a payment to bondholders\nor anyone else, the resulting chaos in global financial markets will be unbearable. The U.S. and global econ-\nomies will quickly descend into recession. In the more than century since the debt limit became law, law-\nmakers have taken strident warnings like these to heart and acted. Let us hope they do so again. Soon.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit brinkmanship (again) 7Endnotes\n1 In this analysis, a default is defined to occur if the Treasury does not make any payment obligation on time, regardless of whether it is Treasury\ndebt or any other payment that is due. A Treasury bond default is a missed payment on a Treasury security. If the Treasury default is short-lived\nand cured with full recovery, then according to the credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service, the ratings impact “would likely be limited,\nwith the sovereign rating likely remaining close to Aaa, consistent with the U.S.’ very high capacity to repay debt and supported by a number of\nkey considerations, including very strong economic and institutional credit features.”\n2 There have been legislative attempts to prioritize Treasury’s payments in the case of breach of the default limit. Social Security payments, pay-\nments to the military, and interest and principal payments to Treasury bond investors receive priority. But the legislation has never become law\nand would likely not mitigate a serious reaction by overseas investors, who would appropriately conclude that this prioritization would be politi-\ncally untenable and not stand for long.\n3 There are likely many unintended consequences as well given how engrained Treasury bonds are in a wide variety of contracts. The tax conse-\nquences of large premiums are also unknown and could be complicated.\n4 On August 5, 2011, S&P announced the company’s decision to give its first-ever downgrade to U.S. sovereign debt, lowering the rating one notch\nto “AA+” with a negative outlook.\n5 The referenced Moody’s Analytics study is available upon request.\n6 The Moody’s Analytics macroeconomic model of the U.S. and global economies is similar in theory and empirics to those used by the Federal\nReserve Board and Congressional Budget Office for forecasting, budgeting and policy analysis. The model has been used to evaluate the plethora\nof fiscal and monetary policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n7 Economists at the Federal Reserve have conducted similar simulations with similar results. See “Possible Macroeconomic Effects of a Temporary\nFederal Debt Default,” Engen, et al., October 2013.\n8 The broad trade-weighted value of the U.S. dollar declines only modestly in this scenario, at least in the near term, as global investors are unsure\nof alternative global safe havens to the dollar. The Swiss franc, euro and British pound are the most significant beneficiaries. However, the value\nof the U.S. dollar steadily weakens in the longer run since its status as the global reserve currency is diminished.\n9 Both Republicans and Democrats supported the close to $3 trillion in deficit-financed fiscal aid provided to the economy to manage through the\npandemic under President Trump in 2020. And while only Democrats supported the almost $2 trillion deficit-financed American Rescue Plan\npassed early in the Biden administration to help with the fallout from the pandemic, only Republicans supported the nearly $2 trillion deficit-fi-\nnanced Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed early in the Trump administration that cut corporate and personal income taxes.\n10 Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first Treasury secretary, established this principal at the founding of the nation when he agreed to pay Revolu-\ntionary War bond investors 100 cents on the dollar. This despite that the bonds were trading at pennies on the dollar because few believed the\nnew American government would make good on its debts. When the government did make good, it established the sound credit of the U.S. and\npaved the way for the U.S. dollar to ultimately become the global economy’s reserve currency. The economic benefits of this over the genera-\ntions are incalculable.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Debt Limit brinkmanship (again) 8About the Author\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
