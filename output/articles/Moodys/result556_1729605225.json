Unusually for regulation, the ORSA is appreciated by\nclientservices.emea@moodys.com\ninsurers as much as their supervisors. Other elements of regulation, such as the solvency\nAsia (Excluding Japan)\n+85.2.2916.1121 capital requirement and reporting, are often seen as a burden by insurers, but the ORSA\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com represents the practical implementation of risk management that sits at the heart of the\nJapan insurance business model and the regulation of the sector.\n+81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices.japan@moodys.com\nThe ORSA is a document produced by insurers exclusively for their supervisors, and is used\ninternally to communicate risk across the business. There are few guidelines for how to carry\nout the ORSA, but most insurers will admit the process for producing the report is far more\nimportant than the report itself, as it forces them to look carefully at the risks facing their\norganization and consider the implications, taking a forward-looking view that is relevant for\nbusiness planning.\nAmong the multitude of risks insurers must deal with, climate change is becoming\nincreasingly important. As the effects on our natural environment become more pronounced,\nand as the world repositions itself for a net-zero emissions future, insurers need to plan and\nrespond appropriately.\nBut how? It is still early days in the development of potential climate scenarios, modeling and\nmeasurement of climate exposures. There are a wide variety of approaches in the market, and\nwhile supervisors are demanding insurers consider climate and have produced some guidance,\nthere is a desire on both sides that it remains the “own” of the insurers and that prescriptive\napproaches are avoided.\nMoody’s Analytics survey and report therefore comes at a perfect time for an industry that\nhas been thinking hard about climate risk and developing individual approaches, but is curious\nto understand the thoughts of others.\nThe report also represents a key milestone in what will no doubt be a long journey to\nunderstand climate risk and put the insurance business on a sustainable pathway.\nChristopher Cundy, Editor, InsuranceERM\nFor purposes of this document, the entity submitting this proposal is Moody’s Analytics, Inc.

There is a lot of modeling uncertainty, both\nscientific and socio-economic. This high uncertainty, and potential materiality has resulted in stakeholder and regulator pressure\nto understand the impacts on business, consumers, and society. Many bodies have begun to address climate risk and other related\nchallenges, from local regulators to international organizations, such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).\nThe ISSB, which is part of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, was established at COP26 to develop\na comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures for the capital markets. The IFRS bases its recommendations on the\nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and offers guidelines on best practice. It is important to note that\nthese are not requirements and that the actual enforcement lies with local regulators in each jurisdiction.\nOne of the main challenges that climate risk poses to the financial sector is calculating how to develop a strong understanding of\nthe evolution of assets in the long term. Anyone with a role related to asset evolution, from investment to risk teams, must stay\nup to date with the relevant standards or requirements. Climate risk is complex and there are several considerations to factor into\nits modeling:\n» It has different dimensions: transition and physical risk\n» The uncertainty surrounding it. Climate science is relatively new, so there are few data points that can indicate to us the likely\nclimate effects of governmental policies. It is also hard to predict the effect of climate change on populaces – what will the\nimpact be on pay and employment? How will fertility and mortality rates be affected?\nAlthough difficult to answer, the insurance sector can no longer ignore these questions, which is why between the rest of 2022 and\ninto 2023, some regulators are focusing more on this challenge. Focus varies by region. There are places where other important\nchallenges are yet to be solved, and therefore overtake climate modeling in the list of priorities.\nThe Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) encourages insurers to understand the risks involved with running their business,\nfrom both a qualitative and a quantitative perspective. Unlike other regulatory requirements, the ORSA is not published. Therefore\ninsurers are struggling to understand how the rest of the market is planning to include climate risk in their process. A European\nInsurance and Occupational Pensions Authority paper from August 20221 states: “Climate change risk can translate into physical\nand transition risk, and can have material impact on the undertakings. Given the potential impact, undertakings are expected to\nintegrate climate change risks into their ORSA by describing and assessing the impact of these risks on their risk profile.” Although it is\naccepted that climate risk will have to be included in the ORSA, it is unclear how much of it will be qualitative, how much\nquantitative, and the timelines for embedding the risk. One of the aims of this survey was to offer some clarity.\nFirms should now also be thinking about climate from a strategic perspective. It is useful to follow the “Four Rs” framework:\nRegulation, Reputational Risk, Risk Management, and Revenue Streams. Regulation is an important catalyst for insurers, and it is\nthe main focus of our survey, along with Risk Management, which is the function in charge of the ORSA. It is worth noting that risk\nmanagement has a broader meaning in finance. It enables a consistent view of risk across investment, capital, liquidity,\nunderwriting, and product design. The remaining two “Rs” should also be at the center of strategic considerations. Reputational\nRisk ensures that the company is operating in line with net-zero and sustainability strategies. Those managing this risk also ensure\nthat due diligence is conducted on counterparties. Finally, Revenue Stream: climate is a risk, but it also presents an opportunity to\nachieve competitive advantage through the impact on underwriting and investment returns.\n1 https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/document-library/other-documents/application-guidance-climate-change-materiality-assessments-and_en\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 3Executive summary\nWe open this report with a quote from an interview with a CRO about their view on embedding climate risk in the insurance risk\nprocesses:\n“Risk management is more about evolution than revolution”\nThis survey has confirmed that the industry is at the beginning of a journey to include climate risk in its analysis for both strategic\nand regulatory purposes. It will take time to adopt strong climate modeling methodology, and even longer to gain the confidence\nnecessary to act on the numbers produced. While there is much desire and intent to start this journey, there is a sense of\nconfusion driven by the many challenges that climate modeling presents to risk teams, as well as a lack of clarity, and increasing\npressure from a regulatory perspective. One survey respondent said: “There is far too much noise that ICs must do something without\nany practical guidance or consensus on what that means.” It is worth noting that in countries such as the UK, where regulators have\nbeen quick to address the situation and are more vocal, insurers are more advanced in their adoption of climate risk into their\nprocesses.\nThis survey report takes a snapshot of the industry’s progress towards the inclusion of climate risk in the ORSA and other risk\nassessment processes. It explores what insurers would like climate modeling to consist of in the future, and the requirements\nnecessary for this to happen. We hope that this report will help set the direction for your journey.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 4Key takeaways\nDrivers to perform climate scenario analysis\nThe main drivers for life insurers to perform climate scenario analysis are disclosure (TCFD) and regulatory needs. Shareholder or\ninvestor pressure only seems to have significant weighting in the APAC region, where it was ranked second to TCFD. Performing\nclimate scenario analysis to influence company strategy is mainly prevalent in the UK, and partially in the rest of Europe, while less\nimportant in North America and APAC.\nModeling can’t be a black box, but insurers struggle to defend their modeling assumptions\nMany respondents indicate that they are struggling to understand and defend their climate risk models. However, we know that\nmodeling using black box solutions will not be sufficient. Regulators and management would be uncomfortable with decision-\nmaking based on assumptions that they and the teams producing the analysis do not fully understand. Since performing this sort\nof analysis is a top priority for 2022, during the coming months we expect to see significant progress in the ability to explain the\nmethodology used to assess climate risk.\nQualitative vs quantitative analysis\nMost insurers are producing qualitative descriptions in their ORSA. It is unclear whether a qualitative description will be enough to\nsatisfy regulatory requirements for this year. Either way, quantitative analysis is becoming more popular because of increasing\nregulatory demand and decision-making pressures. Interestingly, the respondents from insurers who are currently able to perform\nquantitative analysis are typically the ones who are also able to build a climate-aware strategy.\nTransition risk is newer and not sufficiently captured yet\nTransition risk is about potential permanent shifts driven by changes in policies, technology, carbon pricing and regulations, and\nmarket behavior. This risk is most relevant to life insurers, as it directly impacts their assets. However, due to its complexity,\ninsurers are struggling to capture it effectively. As it is also a newer risk, the industry is still in the learning phase of how to model it\ncorrectly.\nInsurers are still wedded to traditional time horizon definitions\nWhen asked about short-, medium-, and long-term horizon definitions, respondents still see them as the same as for traditional\nrisks. Regulators around the globe are asking for longer time horizons for climate; however, it looks like the industry hasn’t adopted\nthem yet.\nIndustry bodies are expected to be the main source of scenarios\nIndustry bodies are specialized on this topic. While the industry is still trying to understand evolving best practice, respondents\nindicate that they will be relying on them, as an intuitive source. Regulators ranked as the second most popular source, followed\nby third-party providers, which currently rank higher than internally developed expertise.\nUK and large life insurers are more advanced in their adoption and planning\nThe survey results suggest that the UK is the most advanced in its climate risk journey. As a global provider, we have seen many\nfirms in the UK adopting more sophisticated approaches to climate modeling and its impact on their business.\nThe respondents from life insurers with the highest value of assets under management (AUM) are also ahead of the smaller\ninsurers in the sophistication of their approach, allocating dedicated resources and integrating climate into decision-making. This is\nrelatively unsurprising, as bigger insurers generally have more resources to invest in this area, and are likely to face more pressure\nfrom shareholders and regulators to keep on top of the latest topics and trends. Many are also members of entities such as the\nNet-Zero Insurance Alliance, which are setting the pace.\nThe industry is still learning\nThe main theme of the verbatim comments in the survey is that the industry is still in the early stages of its journey to assess\nclimate risk. “We have not started assessing climate scenarios yet,” “The company is just embarking on the ESG journey so much is still\nin infancy stage,” “Not much of an issue for us; we will adapt as needed.” Moreover, understanding evolving industry best practice has\nbeen ranked as the top priority for insurers in 2022.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 5This is perhaps the most important thing we learned from this survey, and it will hopefully reassure those who are still familiarizing\nthemselves with climate risk. If you haven’t refined your approach yet, you are not alone. However, we do note that there is much\ninterest in starting to tackle climate risk requirements.\nThe top priorities for 2022 are:\n1. Accessing standardized scenarios\n2. Being able to perform climate-based sensitivities and base decision-making on them\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 6The Survey\nDescription\nBetween April and May 2022, Moody’s Analytics ran a global survey to understand how life insurance companies are incorporating\nclimate risk in the scenario analysis necessary for the ORSA or regional equivalent. The survey was completed by 67 life insurers,\nrelatively equally distributed in terms of seniority, company size, and geographic location, as shown below.\nFigure 1 Job Role\nActuarial Analyst\n3%\nInvestment Analyst / Manager C-Level (CRO, CAO, CFO, CEO,\n5% CSO, CUO, CIO etc.)\n27%\nRisk Analyst / Manager\n33%\nHead of Risk\n13%\nActuary\n19%\nFigure 2 Company Size\nFigure 3 Geographic Location\nNorth America\nAPAC\n28%\n30%\nUK\nEurope 19%\n23%\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 7Top priorities for 2022\n“Implementing a more robust climate risk framework and TCFD are high priorities in 2022”\nFigure 4 In relation to climate scenarios, what are your top three current priorities?\n75%\n50%\n25%\n0%\nIncluding sector Accessing Adopting bespoke Improving model Improving assumption Performing climate- Improving climate- Understanding\nmodeling standardized climate climate scenarios transparency disclosure based sensitivities based decision- evolving industry best\nscenarios making practice\nThe top priority is to understand evolving industry best practice, which is a recurring theme. As best practice continues to develop,\nlife insurers are at different stages of the journey to fully incorporate climate scenarios into their risk assessment. Interestingly, this\nis the top priority in each geographic area, except for the APAC region, where it ranks second, after having access to standardized\nscenarios.\nThe second priority is to be able to perform climate-based sensitivities, most likely\nClimate sensitivities: climate-aware\ndriven by regulation or the need for internal decision-making. The ability to\nwhat-if analyses, allowing insurers to\nimprove climate-based decision-making also ranks highly. Together, these indicate\nunderstand the impact of climate risk on\nthat a priority for 2022 is having a solid understanding of what would happen to\ndifferent aspects of their business, for\nthe business under different climate scenarios.\nexample on the balance sheet and capital\nposition.\nThe third priority is the ability to access standardized scenarios. Access to such\nscenarios is likely to be important for companies who want to produce\nquantitative analysis without developing deep expertise to model scenarios internally and justify them. This observation is most\ncommon among smaller life insurers or those based in the APAC region.\nCombined with the low number of responses for “sector modeling” as a priority in 2022, the findings indicate that the industry as\na whole is not currently looking for highly customizable and sophisticated climate scenario solutions. At this early stage of their\nmaturity, respondents prefer an approach that is simple to understand and to use. We expect sector modeling to become more\nimportant as the market matures. Some climate scenarios have little to no impact at an economy level, although they do impact\nsectors. For example, if one sector overperforms and one underperforms, leaving the levels of GDP unchanged. We expect insurers’\ncapabilities to evolve to be able to model for these dynamics.\nThe request for standardized scenarios is stronger in those areas (by geography and by size) where there appears to be less appetite\nto base decisions on climate modeling. A round of one-to-one interviews that Moody’s Analytics conducted alongside the survey\nsuggested that the larger insurers are building climate expertise internally and plan to have it established in the next two to three\nyears. However, the priority in 2022 is still to access something simple to adopt, understand, and communicate.\nReviewing the responses from a seniority perspective, the C-levels’ top three priorities are the same. It looks like there is a good\nalignment between different job roles and seniorities on the immediate needs and priorities to be addressed.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 8What future climate risk modeling requirements do insurers have?\nKey takeaway: the requirement from the market appears to be top-down, deterministic scenarios that\ntranslate temperature and carbon emissions into financial variables.\nThis section of the survey elaborates on the top priorities identified earlier, to explore what respondents think will be important for\nclimate risk modeling in the future.\nThe first two questions compare the importance of top-down analysis against a bottom-up approach.\nAlmost 80% agree or strongly agree that top-down scenarios\nTop-down approach: uses macroeconomic scenarios to infer\nare important for modeling climate risk.

It is clear that a top-down approach is currently\nthem to infer the impact on the whole company.\nfavored and this remains true irrespective of the size of the\ncompany, its location or seniority of the person taking the\nsurvey.\nMost respondents (87%) think that it is important to have access to standardized climate scenarios. Only 12% disagree and one\nrespondent did not know. Combined with the popularity of these in the priorities question, it appears standardized scenarios are\ncurrently a key requirement for life insurers.\nOver 80% of people surveyed agree or strongly agree that performing climate-based sensitivities is important, reinforcing that this\nis a top priority for 2022.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 9Most respondents (80%) agree that translating climate and temperature\nDeterministic vs stochastic scenarios: in a\npathways into financial variables is important (15% do not know, and less\ndeterministic approach everything develops as a\nthan 5% disagree).

We\nsaw quite an even distribution of responses, skewed towards the agreement that it is a priority this year.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 10MOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 11Drivers and sources for climate scenario analysis\nKey takeaway: regulators are the primary driver to perform climate scenario analysis.\nFigure 5 What is driving the need to perform climate scenario analysis? (Select up to two.)\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related The regulator To influence our strategy Shareholder or investor pressure Other - please explain\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD)\nThe main sources driving respondents to perform climate scenario analysis are the regulator, followed by the TCFD. There are\nsome notable variations when these top-line results are analyzed by location:\n» Shareholder or investor pressures seem to be less impactful around the globe except for the APAC region, where they are\nranked second after TCFD\n» In the UK, a strong driver to perform climate scenario analysis is to influence company strategy. It is the only region in which\nthis ranks comparably to TCFD and the regulator. In the rest of Europe, TCFD ranks highest, followed by the regulator\nFigure 6 Who is responsible for climate scenario analysis in your company?

This is not surprising,\ngiven that the focus of the survey was the risk assessment process, which falls naturally under their purview. Interestingly, in the\nNorth America and APAC regions, around 40% of the responses indicated that the Chief Investment Officer also has some\nresponsibility for climate scenario analysis. In North America, around 30% selected Chief Actuary and Chief Sustainability Officers.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 12Figure 7 Which of these are likely to be your key sources for climate scenarios and models?

The life insurance industry, like many\nobservers committed to sharing best practices,\nothers, is still trying to understand evolving best practice, and industry\ncontributing to the development of climate and\nbodies have an important role to play. Almost half of those surveyed\nenvironment related risk management in the financial\nalso indicated that they will rely directly on the regulator. While\nsector, and mobilizing mainstream finance to support\napplying pressure to produce these analyses, regulators are also\nthe transition‑ towards a sustainable economy.\nsupporting insurers with resources to assist them. Some regulators,\nhowever, have stated that they will eventually switch to supervising,\nwhich is when they expect insurers to meet their requirements on climate modeling alone. External consultants and vendors\nranked higher than internal sources of expertise, although this varies between segments. Respondents from larger life insurers\n($100b-300b AUM) favor internal expertise above external consultants and vendors. This is most likely due to large companies\nhaving enough budget to develop their own resources. Among the respondents from the largest insurers (>$300b AUM) the\nopposite is true. One potential explanation, subject to further market verification, is that these very large players have such a\nsignificant number of entities around the globe that they prefer to rely on external providers that have a more standardized\napproach.\nThese general trends are the same by location, except in North America, where internal sources rank slightly higher than external\nproviders. This might be explained by differences (again, subject to further market verification) in company size, cultural nuances,\nor differences in the market offering from external providers.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 13Current approach to climate scenarios\nKey takeaway: qualitative descriptions are more common, with only the bigger insurers adopting quantitative\napproaches and including climate risk in their strategy.\nThere is an even split on how influential climate analysis is to company strategy. Of our respondents, 45% think climate is already\ninfluencing their strategy, 49% disagree, and the remaining 6% do not know. This top-line finding masks the fact that almost all\n(17 out of 20) of the respondents from the large companies (>$100b AUM) agree with this statement, while the smaller\ncompanies tend to disagree. This is unsurprising given that it is the larger insurers who tend to be at the forefront of adopting\nclimate modeling (and, historically, drove any complex modeling). There were no notable insights when segmenting this data by\nlocation.\nThe results below indicate that qualitative descriptions for climate risk in the ORSA are far more popular than a quantitative\napproach, which by its nature is more demanding. This highlights that most life insurers are still at an early stage in their journey\ntowards adopting a more rigorous approach. The difference is most notable in the APAC region, where only 15% of respondents\nclaim to have good quantitative descriptions of their climate risk exposure in the ORSA; the UK is most advanced, with the\ncorresponding number rising to 50% of people surveyed. North America and the rest of Europe are on the 30% mark.\nDue to a close match in the respective numbers, from the results below we can infer that respondents who say they can produce\ngood quality quantitative scenarios also feel able to defend and disclose their assumptions. On the other hand, it looks as though\nfewer respondents adopting qualitative analysis in their ORSA can comfortably defend them. It seems that the effort to\nimplement quantitative analysis pays out by being able to better explain the results.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 14Most respondents feel that the impact of climate change on their balance sheet at a sector level is unclear. Sector modeling adds\nfurther complexity, and this result suggests that most insurers are currently unable to analyze to this level of detail. There are\nregional variations to this. The UK leads the way with around 50% who feel they have good clarity, followed by North America\n(33%). At the other end of the scale, the rest of Europe and the APAC region mostly disagree (67% and 72% respectively).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 15Current ability to capture climate risk\nKey takeaway: insurers’ ability to model climate risk is still poor.\nThe previous section focused on the approaches used to include climate risk in the risk assessment processes. This section analyzes\na similar question, from a slightly different angle. How robust is the modeling used? We have seen consistent evidence that the\nindustry is still in the early stages of this journey, and climate modeling is typically not sophisticated yet. However, this section\noffers some interesting insights; for example, that insurers are capturing physical risk better than transition risk.\nClimate scenarios have variables, such as temperature and carbon emissions, that change over time. Translating this change into\nfinancial variables is not immediate or straightforward. This is highlighted below: fewer than a third of the respondents said that\nthey can do this.\nThe second statement investigates the ability to decompose climate risk into the short, medium, and long term. Responses are\nfairly evenly spread, with roughly equal numbers either agreeing or disagreeing. When asked if they can understand the long-term\nimpact of climate risk and if they can act on the analysis produced, most respondents felt that they could not.\nThe following two statements explore the ability of respondents to\nTransition risks: permanent shifts driven by changes\ncapture transition and physical risk. Most feel that they are unable to\nin policy, technology, carbon pricing and regulations,\ncapture transition risk effectively. It is possible that insurers may find it\nand market behavior.\ndifficult to plan for and mitigate transition risks, given that they tend to\nPhysical risks: can be divided into acute and chronic.\nbe politically led and implemented at short notice.\n» Acute physical risks: shocks from increased\nnumbers of extreme weather events\nThe results on physical risks are more evenly split, with 42% of the\n» Chronic physical risks: long-term, systemic\nrespondents agreeing that they can capture these effectively.\n(not diversifiable) shifts\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 16There is an even distribution between respondents who feel able to select and defend appropriate climate scenarios versus\nrespondents who feel they cannot. The industry seems to be looking for support and guidelines to produce the analysis, including\nsetting assumptions and how to understand them.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 17Definition of short-, medium-, and long-term horizon\nKey takeaway: insurers still need to adapt time horizons to the latest regulatory guidelines.\nClimate is a new type of risk that differs in many ways from the traditional risk factors insurers are accustomed to. In this section,\nwe calibrate the definition of time horizons between respondents and the regulators. Typically, the short term is anything under\none year, the medium term is 1–10 years and the long term anything above 10 years. This definition varies depending on the\nspecific modeling challenge.\nWe then wanted to understand how climate modeling might change an insurers’ view on different time horizons. Our expectation\nwas to observe longer definitions for each of the short, medium, and long term, especially since the regulator’s view is that climate\nrisk impacts will become apparent over a longer term compared to traditional risks. What was observed instead is that\nrespondents are still fairly wedded to the traditional time horizons.\nShort Term Less than one year 55% (45% indicated up to 5 years)\nMedium Term Up to 15 years 51 % (30% indicated up to 10 years, 19% up to 20 years)\nLong Term 15+ years 81 % (19% indicated 20+ years)\nIt seems likely that this is another reflection of the fact that climate modeling is still in its infancy, and consideration of different\ntime horizons has not yet entered into the equation. This assumption appears to be validated by responses from UK and larger life\ninsurers who we have identified so far as the most advanced, as their results are more aligned with what we expected to see and\nmore closely aligned with guidance provided by regulators.\nShort Term Less than five years\nMedium Term 5–20 years\nLong Term 20+ years\nIt looks like the rest of the industry has a lot of catching up to do to ensure they meet the new requirements of regulators, which\nvary around the globe.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 18Current quality and integration of climate modeling\nKey takeaway: climate modeling needs to be integrated into existing processes.\nThe final section explores the current quality of climate modeling and its integration within an insurer’s processes and decision-\nmaking. The findings are shown all together since, for each of the statements, there is quite a uniform distribution of disagreement\n(roughly 15–25% agree, 60% disagree, and 20% do not know). The level of integration of data sources is poor, which reflects\ngeneral market comments that data is a real issue for life insurers and beyond. Integration is usually something that comes with a\nmore advanced state and this is also true for the level of disclosure of models. The ability to perform sensitivities and make\nclimate-informed decisions is also low despite this being among the top priorities for 2022 (see page 7). It will be interesting to see\nhow the answer to the same question change over the next year.\nMost respondents feel that they do not have a clear plan to overcome material limitations. This must change as life insurers\ndevelop their capabilities to address climate risk. From the discussions that Moody’s Analytics is having with the industry, it seems\nmany insurers are now in an information gathering stage, learning about what the industry is doing, what providers are offering,\nand what regulators are asking for. It might be that clearer plans will emerge after insurers have moved beyond this discovery\nphase.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 19Moody’s Analytics Climate Pathway Scenario Service\nMoody’s Analytics has developed the Climate Pathway Scenario Service to help insurers understand the financial impact of\ndifferent possible climate scenarios. This solution takes input from any climate scenarios framework (for example, NGFS) able to\nprovide temperature paths and carbon emissions under different policies implemented by government. It leverages integrated\nassessment models to get carbon prices and measure the transition and physical risk of the selected climate scenarios. The service\nallows customers to translate the implied macroeconomic dynamics into financial variables and asset class returns.\nThe applications of these scenarios vary from ORSA to TCFD, from investment risk to strategic assets allocation, for life insurers\n(the focus of this survey) but also for P&C insurers, asset managers and pension funds.\nMoody’s Analytics has over 15 years’ experience providing economic scenarios and has built climate expertise in the past few years\nboth internally and by acquiring Vigeo Eiris, 427, and RMS. Joint with the services of RMS, the Climate Pathways Scenario Service\nallows insurers to assess the impact of climate change on both the asset and the liability side2.\nTo read more about climate risk for insurers, please visit our website or get in touch to speak to our experts about your specific\nneeds.\n2 https://www.moodysanalytics.com/about-us/press-releases/2021-05-18-unipol-gruppo-selects-moodys-analytics-climate-pathway-scenario-service\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIFE INSURERS: CLIMATE RISK MODELING IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS 20© 2022 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
