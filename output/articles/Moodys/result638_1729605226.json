We are now seeing a divergence in monetary policies with\nthe United States starting to raise interest rates; it might do so another three times this year. Meanwhile,\nother jurisdictions continue to maintain interest rates at historically low levels, or cut them even further.\nThis divergence and recent market volatility are creating much uncertainty in terms of risk management. For\nmany banks, tackling the interest rate issue and keeping their margins constant have become a top priority.\nIn April 2016, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued standards for Interest Rate Risk in the\nBanking Book (IRRBB). The standards revise the Committee’s 2004 Principles for the Management and\nSupervision of Interest Rate Risk. Those principles set out supervisory expectations for banks’ identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring, and control of IRRBB, as well as its supervision.\nThe new IRRBB standards reflect changes in the market and supervisory practices which are pertinent in light\nof the recent exceptionally low interest rates in many jurisdictions. The revised standards are expected to be\nimplemented by 2018.\nAdhering to the IRRBB framework presents some major challenges. We conducted a snap poll of 285 industry\nprofessionals during a webinar that took place on March 5, 2017. It revealed that nearly a third (32%) saw “data\ngathering” as their biggest challenge in IRRBB compliance. A further 27% saw “building automated systems to\nsupport regular measurement and reporting” as the biggest challenge. Nearly a quarter (24%) named “building\nbehavior models” as the biggest challenge, which can also be seen as dependent on gathering data and building\nsystems. Only a small minority (6%) believed that “completing interest rate scenarios with stress and reverse\nscenarios” would be their top challenge. The remaining 11% named “setting up an appropriate governance\nframework” as their biggest challenge.1\nThe Evolution of the New BCBS Standards\nBefore getting into the detail of the new standards, it is worth understanding the background and the process\nby which they were established. The earlier guidance on interest rate risk goes all the way back to July 2004.\nIt includes a set of 15 principles for both the trading book and the banking book, of which two were dedicated\nto the banking book.\nThe new IRRBB standards follow a Consultative Paper published in June 2015, which set out a two-pillar\napproach for banks to guarantee that there is “appropriate capital to cover potential losses from exposures to\nchanges in interest rates” and to limit arbitrage between the trading book and the banking book.\n» Pillar 1: Standardized Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) based on two metrics, the Economic Value of\nEquity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) measured under six interest rate scenarios\n» Pillar 2: A set of 12 principles to guide banks and supervisors in measuring risk and assessing capital\nadequacy internally\nFeedback from the industry published in September 2015 unanimously rejected Pillar 1’s standardized MCR,\neven as a fallback in Pillar 2, based on two main arguments: first, that there can be no one-size-fits-all model\nfor the banking book given the diversity of products, plans, behavior, bank strategy, tax regimes and so on.\n1. The poll was conducted during an interactive webinar hosted by Risk.net, AsiaRisk and Moody’s Analytics on March 5, 2017.\n3 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nAnd second, even if internal models were allowed in Pillar 1, the constraints on their calibration would be too\nrestrictive or lead to inconsistent results in scenarios involving shocked interest rates.\nA further quantitative impact study, which included the computation of MCR as described in Pillar 1 for 153\nparticipating banks, confirmed the comments received earlier. On average, the materiality on NII was around\nthree percent of CET1 capital. The materiality on EVE was significant but, looking at the standard deviation,\nscattered. For most of the larger banks, the proposed standard MCR would have led to a significant increase\nin the amount of capital to hold compared with one computed through an internal management system.\nSince this consultation, the IRRBB standards published in April 2016 are based on Pillar 2; Pillar 1 becomes a\nsimplified optional framework, with a revision of its parameters and using the former Option 1 (based only on\nfull EVE variations) for capital adequacy.\nThe New IRRBB: Executive Summary\nFollowing the consultation, the important changes to the 2004 Principles are as follows:\n» The only element of standardization lies in the six interest rate scenarios for which variations of both\nEVE and NII are required\n» A stricter threshold for identifying outlier banks has been reduced from 20% of a bank’s total capital to\n15% of a bank’s Tier 1 capital. In addition, interest rate risk exposure is measured by the maximum change\nin the economic value of equity under the prescribed interest rate shock scenarios\n» More extensive guidance on the expectations for a bank’s IRRBB management process, especially in\nareas such as the development of shock and stress scenarios relying on validated internal models\n» Enhanced disclosure requirements to promote greater consistency, transparency, and comparability in\nthe measurement and management of IRRBB. This section includes quantitative disclosure requirements\nbased on common interest rate shock scenarios\n» An updated standardized framework, which supervisors could mandate their banks to follow or banks\ncould choose to adopt\nNine Principles for the Banks\nThe following overview of the nine principles sets the context for practical steps towards compliance.2\nPRINCIPLE 1: SCOPE\nThis principle reiterates that IRRBB is an important risk for all banks that must be identified, monitored, and\ncontrolled. Banks should also monitor Credit Spread Risk on the Banking Book (CSRBB).\nPRINCIPLE 2: GOVERNANCE\nPrinciple 2 describes the role and functions of the governing body, which is responsible for oversight of the\nIRRBB management framework.\nPRINCIPLE 3: RISK APPETITE “DASHBOARD”\nThe governing body is responsible for setting consistent limits and measures to drive the business strategy in\naccordance with the bank’s risk appetite. This principle underlines the importance of anticipation of specific\nscenarios and reactivity in setting limits accordingly.\n2. For a detailed review of the principles, please refer to our white paper, A Summary of BCBS Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book Directive\n(September 2016).\n4 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nPRINCIPLE 4: MEASURES\nPrinciple 4 establishes that IRRBB must be based on both economic values (EVE) and earnings (NII). These\nvalues quantify a change in present value and future profitability, respectively measured on a static stock\nrunning off or a dynamic stock including new or renewed business. These changes are of consequence for the\ninterest rate scenarios.\nThe BCBS prescribes six interest rate shocks but in addition requires internal interest rate scenarios built for\nthe internal capital adequacy assessment process and stress scenarios. In addition to these, reverse scenarios\ncomplete the requirement.\nFigure 1 indicates what the six prescribed shocks would look like for the Euro, US Dollar, and Singapore Dollar,\nunder the assumption of a flat curve of one percent for the stricken currency; parallel shocks, one upward and\none downward; then two distortions of the curve, one steepening (short rates down and long rates up), and\none flattening (short rates up and long rates down); and finally two scenarios impacting only the maturity,\nshort rates up or short rates down.\nFigure 1 The six prescribed shocks for EUR, USD, and USG\nPRINCIPLE 5: MODELS\nMeasuring IRRBB EVE and NII requires modeling assumptions with complexity in line with the size and profile\nof the bank for: behavioral options like prepayment and early redemption of term deposits and fixed rate loan\ncommitments, the run-off profile of non-maturing deposits, the duration of own equity, and the impact of\naccounting practices.\nPRINCIPLE 6: PROCESS\nModels used to measure IRRBB must be comprehensive and covered by governance processes for model risk\nmanagement. They need to include a validation function that is independent of the development process.\nEssentially, while the governing body is responsible for the selection, calibration and management of the\nIRRBB models, it can rely on a third-party vendor for running these processes.\nPRINCIPLE 7: REPORTING\nThe content of internal reporting to the governing body must be clearly detailed. It must cover not only\nmeasures of exposures but also information on the models themselves, including key modeling assumptions,\nand reviews of risk modeling policies and procedures.\n5 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nPRINCIPLE 8: DISCLOSURE\nTwo annual reports are required for public disclosure: Table A for qualitative information and Table B for\nthe ∆EVE and ∆NII under the prescribed scenarios. For the quantitative disclosure, the bank must disclose\nvariations in EVE for its banking book under the six prescribed scenarios mentioned earlier. It must do so\nunder some specific constraints, such as not including the bank’s own equity, margin and spread flows, and\nrun-off balance sheet in a repricing view. The bank must also disclose variations of projected NII over a rolling\n12-month period in two balance sheet scenarios (see Figure 2).\nIn addition to the quantitative disclosure, banks must provide sufficient qualitative information and\nsupporting detail to enable the market and public to monitor the sensitivity of the bank’s economic value and\nearnings to changes in interest rates.\nPRINCIPLE 9: CAPITAL\nWhatever the disclosure, the capital assigned to IRRBB remains part of the ICAAP. However, explicit factors\ndriving its evaluation are listed.\nSUPERVISORY ASSESSMENT\nIn addition to the nine principles for banks, there are a further three principles providing detailed guidelines\non conducting the supervisory reviews. In general, supervisory assessment might be stricter and more\ntransparent than previously the case, with more discretionary powers given to local supervisors. The local\nsupervisor might ask the banks to provide additional results such as the repricing gap, the variation of their\nearning in internal scenarios, or the sensitivity of metrics to the models’ underlying assumptions. Local\nsupervisors might, at their own discretion, review, and adjust the calibration of shock sizes of different\ncurrencies to reflect local conditions.\nFigure 2 Quantitative disclosure\n6 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nSome Strategic Considerations in IRRBB\nCompliance\nImplementation of Banking Book Boundaries\nThe first practical challenge in implementing IRRBB lies with defining how transactions are mapped to the\nbanking book or the trading book. Two different people in any bank are likely to give a different answer to the\nquestion, “Does this transaction belong in the banking or the trading book?”\nIt is vital that the same rules apply consistently across the entire group. Documentation of the boundaries\nmust, therefore, be mandatory and must be precise if you want your reports and your calculations to\nmake sense.\nIn collecting transactional data, there must be clear definitions for making the right choice for different types\nof asset across the group.\nDisclosure Requires Clarity of Thought\nPrinciple 8 (Disclosure) of IRRBB is focusing many minds from an Asset & Liability Management (ALM)\nperspective. Equity analysts are increasingly interested in understanding more about banks’ balance sheets\nand already sending the banks some informed inquiries.\nWith interest rates expected to rise through 2017 and 2018, analysts are asking about NII sensitivity. In\nparticular, they wonder how much NII might go up or down across a range of scenarios. Banks must balance\nNII sensitivity to rate changes against EVE sensitivity to rate changes, and relate those sensitivities to both\nequity analysts’ and shareholders’ expectations. Doing so requires greater clarity of thought than was\npreviously the case, and as a result, the compliance effort can have a positive impact in terms of how banks\nstructure their balance sheets.\nThat said, these issues are not straightforward for non-ALM and non-treasury specialists, so it is possible\nthat shareholders and the general public will misunderstand. Disclosure under the new IRRBB standards\nis extensive. The specialists therefore face a considerable challenge: on the one hand in communicating\nbalance sheet structures in a suitably thorough and nuanced way for analysts and supervisory bodies, while\non the other giving adequate insight to a broader audience as is required in the BCBS text.\nThe Practical Challenges: Data, Modeling &\nGovernance\nThe key questions for any bank as it tackles IRRBB are:\n» Data: we have it for managing credit risk and liquidity risk, but do we have the aggregated and granular\ndata required to measure interest rate risk?\n» Modeling: what models are appropriate for the measurement of interest rate risk, and if we build such\nmodels, do we have the data required to calibrate them?\n» Governance: Can we take this opportunity to put IRRBB at the center of a framework not only for interest\nrate risk but also other risks, stress testing, and financial planning to give us a really holistic view of\nthe bank?\n7 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nData Gathering Is the Top Challenge\nMany banks are concerned that they simply do not have the historical data to model the scenarios outlined\nunder Principle 5, largely because they have been operating in an abnormally low interest rate environment\nfor many years. For instance, how is a bank to calculate the impact of a rate change on non-maturing\ndeposits, if the interest rate has not changed for the past 10 years? If they run a correlation with interest rates\nthat have been essentially static, they are bound to get poor results. They might go back and look at what\nhappened ten years earlier but this will not reflect current clients, channels and behaviors. In particular, it is\nvery tricky trying to understand customer behaviors with traditional techniques. In many cases, a bank will\nsimply be unable to run sophisticated models with the data it has.\nIn the absence of adequate quantitative data, IRRBB compliance officers will need to rely on even greater\ncollaboration with the business for the systematic provision of qualitative information and on testing out\nvarious assumptions. This goes to the heart of Principle 5: demonstrating to the bank’s management that\nthey are dealing with uncertainty. Uncertainty must be taken into account when taking strategic decisions or\ndesigning structural hedges. In this respect IRRBB should provide insights that will help management to make\nbetter decisions.\nIn fact, our poll revealed that 92% of the audience regarded IRRBB as an investment opportunity to improve\ninternal systems, with 40% mentioning stress testing, 38% revamping ALM systems and 22% mentioning\nintegration of the IRRBB compliance platform with Basel III liquidity coverage ratio and net stable\nfunding ratio.\nAs we have seen with new regulations in the past, having accepted that IRRBB compliance is a requirement,\nbanks will use it as an opportunity to get more data into their systems and to improve their modeling.\nWhile the impact of IRRBB varies according to the type of bank and the country or countries in which a bank\noperates, this is the common point for them all.\nAfter all, ALM is not just about IRRBB. There is an overlap with other balance sheet management topics,\nincluding liquidity risk, FX risk, liquidity coverage ratio forecasts, funds transfer pricing, and IFRS 9. To\ngenerate consistent results across the bank, it is therefore imperative that banks have a single source of data.\nTop management wants to be able to report across all areas and all types of risk using standard reports.\nIRRBB provides the opportunity to move towards this unitary risk framework. Behavioral assumptions should\nbe consistent for all risks, and they require long time series with more reporting dimensions. Hence there is a\nneed to increase data granularity and to industrialize data management with a single source of data.\nDifferent Modeling Approaches\nPrinciple 5 states that in measuring IRRBB, key behavioral and modeling assumptions should be fully\nunderstood, conceptually sound, and documented. Such assumptions should be vigorously tested and\naligned with the bank’s business strategies.\nBoth the economic value and earnings-based measures of IRRBB are impacted by many assumptions made\nfor risk quantification. These assumptions include:\n» Expectations for the exercise of both explicit and embedded interest rate options by both the bank and its\ncustomers under specific interest rate shock and stress scenarios\n» The treatment of balances and interest flows arising from non-maturity deposits (NMDs)\n8 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n» Treatment of the bank’s own equity in economic value measures\n» The implications of accounting practices for IRRBB and impact of modeling on the bank’s balance sheet\nAssessing its IRRBB exposures, a bank must make judgments and assumptions about how an instrument’s\nactual maturity or repricing behavior might diverge from the instrument’s contractual terms because of\nbehavioral options.\nA major challenge in applying such judgments and assumptions is that some of the modeling techniques are\nentirely new to some banks. For example, many banks have focused mainly on EVE and much less so on NII,\nwhich means that they were not taking into account non-maturity deposit modeling as defined in the IRRBB\nframework. Banks now must build the appropriate models. To get there they first must ask difficult questions\nsuch as, “How do we define core components of a non-maturity deposit?”, “How do we define the volatile\npart?”, “What data do we need?” and “How do we aggregate our non-maturity deposits?” Banks lack both\nthe historical and transactional data required to segment the different non-maturity deposits to perform\nappropriate modeling for the different types.\nGenerally speaking, a bank’s information for ALM purposes is at an aggregated, non-granular level.\nAggregated data is unfit for IRRBB modeling, where banks must analyze more dimensions, more precisely\nfor diverse accounts such as fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk, term deposits subject to early\nredemption risk, and NMDs. Choosing the right dimensions to provide this granularity will be key to building\ndetailed and accurate models.\nA bank might build a model, but then encounter an obstacle in that the model cannot be applied because the\ndata required is incomplete or not yet organized and catalogued. The bank might need to make a trade-off by\nredefining the model based on the currently available data. In practical terms, the project team might need\nto use the data that is available now, and over the objections of the quality team, which wants to build the\nbest possible model for future use.\nDefining new business assumptions to perform dynamic simulation is challenging, especially for banks that\nare currently measuring EVE but not NII. Generally, the bank’s financial planners will provide input, but their\ninput might be at different levels of granularity from the model dimensions, and making the link will not\nalways be easy.\nThe top five in-house IRRBB standard behavior models built by banks, according to the webinar poll, are run-off\nof maturing deposits (44%), prepayment on fixed-rate loans (33%), early redemption on term deposits (15%),\nfacility usage (6%), and credit card usage and behavior (2%).\nGovernance and Managerial Issues\nALM has been a well-known topic in banks, so many practices are already well covered, but the IRRBB\nregulators are asking for more documentation and standardized processes. Governance that is managed\nmainly in Excel or small systems, is no longer acceptable. Governance must focus more strongly on:\n» Model risk management\n» The limit framework\n» Definition of roles and responsibilities – the right roles for the right people\n9 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nThe burdens of different modeling approaches are considerably lightened if the bank integrates all the\nconsiderations on modeling within a consistent group-wide framework based on best practice.\nTo summarize, IRRBB presents an excellent opportunity to put in place the data, modeling, and governance\nframework that enables the sharing of reports between different teams in the bank. Top management must\ngrasp this opportunity with both hands.\nSome Final Considerations\nNegative Interest Rate Scenarios\nWith interest rates in many jurisdictions lingering at historic lows, modeling negative interest rate scenarios\nhas become a new and difficult challenge for many in the ALM community. Many banks have floored their\nrates at zero for their internal models but the regulators are nevertheless interested in what would happen\ngiven negative rate scenarios. If interest rates went to -1%, would you have a negative customer rate in this\nstressful scenario, or would that customer rate be floored to zero or floored to some positive margin? Much\nwould depend on the contract with each customer, but it introduces a floor in the product. The net interest\nmargin would be rate-dependent, and the margin on the product would have an impact on EVE. Different\nbanks will choose to model this scenario at the portfolio level or the granular level. Banks with 30 years of\nfixed-rate mortgages will likely choose to model at the granular level; and banks in regions where floating-\nrate mortgages are the norm will likely model at the portfolio level.\nThe IRRBB Metrics\nIt is important to understand that it is variation in EVE and NII that must be measured, not the absolute\nvalues. ∆EVE and ∆NII are useful new metrics for risk management. Many banks are still relying on gap and\nduration measurement, but these metrics are becoming obsolete, useful only for measuring parallel shocks.\nWe are now dealing with distortion along the curve in prescribed scenarios, so having both types of metrics\nwill prove to be a benefit more than a burden. There are plenty of tools in the risk manager’s toolbox from\nbasic gap analysis to more sophisticated tools such as value at risk, and earnings at risk through Monte\nCarlo simulations. However, many in the industry take the view that nowadays you cannot escape modeling\nthrough cash flows with validation models for automatic options.\nAdjusting the sophistication when modeling cash flows through flexibility makes sense on at least on two\nlevels. First, you can reduce the volume and the calibration of the models by aggregating, for example, loans\nand non-maturing deposits with similar characteristics, and you can aggregate cash flow generation at the\ncompact level. Computer power in terms of volume and performance is no longer a barrier to such analyses.\nSecond, once you are comfortable with your models, you can use dynamic simulations, starting small before\nmodeling new business hypotheses based on a constant balance sheet, and then enriching the model to test\nsensitivity to changing interest rates.\nTrend towards Dynamic Simulations\nMost banks assess interest rate risk based on recent financial results and a constant balance sheet, but such\nstatic measures are not terribly useful in evaluating alternative interest rate risk management strategies,\nbecause a particular strategy cannot be evaluated until it has been implemented, by which time it is\n10 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMOODY’S ANALYTICS\ntoo late to try others. Dynamic techniques use a simulation model to evaluate the potential impact of a\nstrategy before it has been implemented, providing an opportunity to assess the trade-off between different\nstrategies. Such dynamic simulation is not yet common practice across the industry but is a growing trend,\npossibly with convergence around counterparty credit risk (CCR) standards. It is a powerful model for\nbusinesses that want to integrate capital planning, CCR, budgeting, and IRRBB. It is not an easy step to take\nbecause of the data gathering issue, so no bank is going to do it overnight. However, it is necessary to head\nin that direction to get better insights into how to manage difficult scenarios, such as what happens if they\nrun off non-maturing deposits under a hard shock. Rather than sticking to a static view limited to one year,\nyou could have a run-off model with different levels to show the managers the tactical risk with one funds\ntransfer price and the structural risk with all the variability and trade-offs.\nDynamic simulations rely on making detailed assumptions, for example, regarding changes in existing\nbusiness lines, new business, and changes in customer behavior. It might not be fully understood within the\nbank outside specialist ALM functions. So you need to prepare your bank’s culture to ease it into dynamic\nmodeling. In the initial phase, this will involve testing some assumptions and presenting the results with the\nappropriate caveats so that a particular outcome is not taken at face value.\n11 SEPTEMBER 2017 INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK (IRRBB): MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGESMMOOOODDYY’’SS AANNAALLYYTTIICCS\n© 2017 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).

(“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by\nMoody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a\nNationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are\nassigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rat-\ning agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively.\nMJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and\npreferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services\nrendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.\nMJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.\nSP47311/IND110B"
