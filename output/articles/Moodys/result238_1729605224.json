Annual real GDP growth for the UK is forecasted to be an anemic 0.65% in 2023, weakening further to 0.34%\nin 2024 under the baseline scenario. The scenario also anticipates that the BoE will not implement further rate hikes, but that\nrate cuts would be expected to start only in mid-2024, while the return to the long-run equilibrium rate of 2% is expected to\nbe much more gradual.1\nThe higher-for-longer rates outlook will continue to weigh heavily on corporate borrowers as the cumulative effect of the\nBoE’s 14 consecutive rates increases works its way through the economy. The Bank of England’s policy response to combat the\nhighest inflation in decades has rapidly pushed the bank rate from a record low of 0.1% in November 2021 to the current\n5.25% level. In its August Bank Overground blog2 post, the BoE warned that UK companies will come under increasing risk of\ndefault as they grapple with higher debt servicing stress as a result of higher borrowing costs, with the proportion of firms with\nlow interest coverage ratios projected to increase from 45% in 2022 to 50% by the end of 2023.\nThe worsening credit environment is already resulting in higher debt defaults. The Moody’s Analytics’\nrealized trailing 12-month default rate for UK companies rated by Moody’s Investors probability of default\nService has risen sharply, from 0.2% in September 2022 to 1.5% as of October 2023\nmeasures suggest that UK\n(the red line in Exhibit 1). The trend is also apparent in government statistics. The UK\ncorporate defaults could\nInsolvency Service recently reported that between July 1 and September 30 there\nrise to rival the pandemic\nwere 6,208 registered company insolvencies in England and Wales, the highest level\nsince the GFC according to the agency.3 recession peak\nMoody’s Analytics’ forward-looking probability of default measures have historically led changes in actual corporate default\nrates by about one year. This relationship is evident in Exhibit 1, where the blue lines, the average expected PDs for public and\nprivate firms, rise and peak about a year before the red line, the actual trailing 12-month default rate for all Moody’s-rated UK\nfirms.4 The increase in the average expected PDs since the end of 2021 suggests that the realized default rate for Moody’s-\nrated UK companies could reach 3.1% by the fourth quarter of 2024, rivaling the 3% peak default rate following the Covid\npandemic economic shock in 2020. In the event that we do see the pace of defaults reach that level, it would be the highest\ndefault rate for UK Moody’s-rated companies since the 4.4% annual default rate recorded in 2009 during the height of the\nGFC (and during which more that 10% of below investment-grade rated firms defaulted).\nTight monetary and refinancing conditions are resulting in rising default risk across\nCyclical, discretionary\nindustry sectors. Exhibit 2 shows how the average one-year expected PDs for UK public\nconsumer and capital\ncompanies have changed over the 12 months ending Q3 2023, ranked from highest to\ncost-sensitive sectors lowest risk (PD) level. Fifteen of the 21 industry sectors have experienced an increase in\nshow the highest risk of the average one-year risk of default in the last 12 months, with 9 sectors posting increases\ndefault of 30% or more in their expected average probability of default. Energy, discretionary\nconsumer, and capital cost-sensitive sectors have seen the greatest increases in credit risk.\nNot only have CRE, capital cost-sensitive, and discretionary consumer sectors experienced the highest increase in forward-\nlooking default risk (Exhibit 2), the same sectors have also seen the highest number of actual defaults in 2023. So far in 2023\n2,749 UK companies (public and private) have experienced a credit event (missed payment, insolvency, administration).5\nExhibit 3 shows the distribution of actual UK company defaults in 2023 through October by industry sector.\n1 Moody’s Analytics alternative economic scenarios are available through www.economy.com to subscribers of the service.\n2 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground/2023/ how-vulnerable-are-uk-companies-to-higher-interest-rates\n3 https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/company-insolvency-statistics-july-to-september-2023/commentary-company-insolvency-statistics-july-\nto-september-2023\n4 Our projection of the Moody’s UK corporate default rate is derived from a regression of the historical Moody’s UK corporate default rate on the 12-\nmonth lagged average expected PD. It is not a forecast of the default rate from the ratings agency itself.\n5 The 2,749 UK company defaults include both public and private, rated and unrated debt defaulters.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT STRATEGY 2Exhibit 2 – Energy, discretionary consumer, and capital cost-sensitive sectors have seen the greatest increases in credit\nrisk\nAverage one-year expected PDs for UK public companies by industry sector\nData source: Moody’s Analytics EDF-X platform\nExhibit 3 – CRE, capital cost-sensitive, and discretionary consumer sectors have also experienced the highest number of\ndefaults in 2023\nYear-to-date (October) counts of UK company defaults by industry sector\nData source: Moody’s Analytics Orbis database\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT STRATEGY 3As credit stress intensifies, identifying companies most at-risk is critical\nThe rise in default risk for UK companies has brought renewed emphasis on the need to actively manage credit risk. In a period\nof heightened credit stress, it can be particularly difficult to spot potential problem borrowers as many, if not, most companies\nare impacted by the more difficult operating environment. When we see the average risk of default for an industry sector\nincrease sharply, as it has for the construction and real estate sector, for example, identifying exactly which firms in the\nstressed sector are most likely to experience a credit event becomes critical.\nMoody’s Analytics’ Early Warning System (EWS) was designed to do just that. The EWS Nearly one in four UK\nuses two key measures to identify companies as low, medium, high, or severe risk over public companies are\nthe next 12 months. The two measures are (1) whether a company’s forward-looking PD\nflagged as high or\nmeasure is above an appropriate sector early warning trigger level; and (2) the change in\nsevere risk compared to\nthe PD-implied rating. Moody’s Analytics research has shown that public companies with\ntheir industry sector\nhigh early warning signals are 25 times more likely to default over the next year than\nfirms with low early warning signals. peers\nAs of November 2023, Moody’s Analytics’ Early Warning System shows that of the 1,387 public UK companies, 320 – nearly\none in four – are flagged as high or severe risk compared to their industry sector peers. In Exhibit 4 the orange and red circles\nrepresent these most at-risk companies, with the size of the circles indicating the relative sizes (in terms of asset value) of the\ncompanies.\nExhibit 4 – As of November 2023, 320 public UK companies are categorized as high or severe risk by Moody’s Analytics’\nEarly Warning System\nEarly warning signals for UK public companies as of 1 November, 2023\nData source: Moody’s Analytics EDF-X platform\nThe data in Exhibit 4 suggests that company size and early warning at-risk status are correlated in the current macro-credit\nclimate: higher borrowing costs and weak economic fundamentals have contributed to causing smaller public companies to be\nmore likely categorized as high or severe risk. Larger firms have proved to be more resilient to the challenging macro-credit\nenvironment, as evidenced by the relatively higher number of firms in the low EWS risk category with larger, green circles.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT STRATEGY 4Exhibit 5 sheds more light on which UK corporate sectors are triggering more early warning alerts. The graph is sorted by\nindustry sectors showing the highest percentage of companies with high or severe Early Warning System signals. Many of the\nindustry sectors whose average one-year expected default risk have increased the most over the past year also show the\nhighest percentage of firms with high or severe early warning signals. Energy, travel/leisure, equipment, and transportation –\ncyclically sensitive sectors – show a relatively high percentage of risks.\nExhibit 5 – Some sectors whose PDs have increased the most have also crossed their early warning trigger levels\nEarly warning signals distribution for UK public companies by industry sector as of 1 November, 2023\nData source: Moody’s Analytics EDF-X platform\nThe necessity and value of an effective early warning system becomes clear when we look at the example of Wilko Limited,\nwhich fell into administration on 10 August, 2023. Wilko Limited, the venerable 93-year-old high-street retailer chain, is a\nprivate, unrated, family-owned business. At the time of its default, the company was estimated to owe £548 million to\nunsecured creditors, including its own pension scheme and its suppliers.6 PricewaterhouseCoopers, Wilko’s administrator,\nestimated that unsecured creditors stood to recovery between just 4% and 8% on the pound of their claims. With no traded\nequity or debt, and no public ratings, monitoring exposure to a company like Wilko would seem to be a nearly impossible\nchallenge.\nMoody’s Analytics’ EWS, however, flagged Wilko as an elevated risk of default in January 2022. Its one-year expected PD\njumped from 0.38% at the end of 2021 to 5.2% in January 2022 after the company reported a £36.8 million pre-tax loss from\na profit of £4.4 million the previous year. At the same time, the jump in its expected PD measure breached the early warning\ntrigger level for its industry sector. On its own, a 5.2% probability of default over a one-year time horizon may not appear to\nbe a signal of imminent risk. A 5% one-year PD maps roughly to a single-B level of risk on Moody’s ratings scale – not an\n6 Onita, L. (2023, September 29). Wilko collapsed owing unsecured creditors almost £550mn, Financial Times.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT STRATEGY 5insignificant level of risk, but seemingly not an urgent threat. Given the uncertainty around Wilko’s financial situation in 2022\nand early 2023, when it sought to raise capital to keep it afloat, creditors must have both feared and hoped for the company’s\nfuture.\nIt is precisely in such situations that an effective early warning system is needed. By making relative comparisons with\nappropriate peer groups in industry sectors (in a given country), Moody’s Analytics’ Early Warning System helps identify which\ncompanies are most at risk, even when, in absolute terms, it may not be clear what risk measures may be implying about\nfuture credit risk. Between August and September 2023, Wilko’s PD jumped from 6.1% to 35%7 as the company collapsed\ninto administration.\nExhibit 6 – Wilko Limited triggered an early warning of heightened risk in January 2022, 19 months before default\nOne-year PD measure for Wilko Limited vs. its sector early warning trigger level\nData source: Moody’s Analytics EDF-X platform\nHigher default risk, no recession required\nThe rising trend in Moody’s Analytics’ probabilities of default for UK companies shows that regardless of whether the UK\neconomy technically enters a recession in 2024 or not, the level of credit stress may be as severe as that experienced during\nthe peak of the Covid pandemic. If UK economy underperforms, Moody’s Analytics’ recession scenario for the UK forecasts\nthat real GDP growth in 2024 would be negative for all four quarters, for a -2.6% growth rate for the year. Under such a\nscenario, default rates would likely rise to levels consistent with historical recessions, in the neighborhood of 4% for all UK\ncompanies, and around 10% for below investment-grade firms.\nCyclical industry sectors, discretionary consumer, and capital cost-sensitive sectors are most at-risk over the next year.\nMoody’s Analytics’ Early Warning System confirms that not only are those industry sectors seeing relatively high year-over-\nyear changes in credit risk, but they also represent sectors with the highest concentrations of companies that have breached\nearly warning trigger levels. By focusing on those companies, investors and lenders can potentially take proactive measures to\nmitigate any future credit losses, as the example of Wilko Limited shows.\n7 35% is the maximum forward-looking probability of default for a UK private company in Moody’s Analytics EDF-X platform.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CREDIT STRATEGY 6© 2023 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
