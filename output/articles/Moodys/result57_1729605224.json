From geopolitical tensions to stricter regulations\nand a need to get deeper into supply chains, there are many factors driving this shift. But data and organizational\nobstacles persist. By overcoming these challenges and others, companies can unlock better clarity in relation to\nthe third-party entities they are dealing with, improving their risk and compliance processes across their entire\norganization.\n01 05\nThese are highly uncertain times, Data challenges include siloes,\nwith high levels of risk, but this poor accuracy and the costs of\nprovides risk and compliance teams remediation, as well as effective\nwith the opportunity to be heard by integration of internal / external\nsenior management. data.\n02 06\nEntity Verification is perceived as There is some dissatisfaction with\nimportant, and is widely predicted the quality of tools and data for EV,\nto grow in importance; use cases not least due to the lack of clear\nare expanding as new instruments data lineage.\nemerge (e.g., crypto).\n03 07\nThough important, EV is still more While a single customer view is still\nvisible to risk and compliance roles, elusive, more advanced companies\nand its impact is not fully visible are more likely to have senior buy-\namong the wider business and in, and to have implemented more\nsenior leadership. measures.\n04 Entity Verification needs to be 08 AI and LLM (Large Language Model)\nconsidered as the essential bedrock adoption continue to progress, albeit\nunderpinning all third-party risk not quickly.

Ensuring they have access to high quality data, good levels of data maturity, and data governance unlocks\nthe door to effective Entity Verification, which in turn, enables the use of AI in this sphere.\nAnd as we learned from our research, good Entity Verification is the foundation on which companies can protect\nthemselves against many other risks. It is what enables effective Master Data Management, Customer Lifecycle\nManagement and Know Your Customer activities.\nWhen you see it in this light, it couldn’t be more important. Those companies that can overcome these challenges\nwill be best placed to avoid the multiple risks associated with poor Entity Verification, having a better answer to the\nquestion “Who am I doing business with?”\nmmooooddyyss..ccoomm//eennttiittyyvveerriifificcaattiioonn WWhhoo aarree yyoouu ddooiinngg bbuussiinneessss wwiitthh?? 18GET IN TOUCH\nContact\ninformation\nPlease get in touch with the team at\nMoody’s to discuss Entity Verification\nand how to solve your risk and\ncompliance challenges.
