Ultra-low mortgage interest rates offset some of the increase in pric-\nes, keeping monthly mortgage payments affordable for many households. However, with the rapid increase\nin mortgage interest rates since the start of 2022, the underlying dynamics of the housing market are\nchanging, putting homeownership outside the reach of millions of would-be first-time homebuyers.\nThe combination of increased borrowing costs, elevated inflation, and a softening labour market spells the\nend for the housing boom. We project house prices will suffer a peak-to-trough decline of about 10% by\nearly 2024. Although the reduction in demand due to affordability will lead price declines in the near term,\ndemographics will provide a sizable tailwind in the medium and long run as many members of the millenni-\nal generation are now in their prime years for starting families and buying homes.\nRecent Performance\nThe pace of Canadian house price appreciation over the past two years has been nothing short of spectac-\nular. Low interest rates, an undersupplied market, and shifting preferences toward more space amid the\nwork-from-home era made it incredibly easy for demand to outstrip supply. Homebuyers have been forced\nto contend with less selection than in the previous housing cycle.\nThere is little doubt that house prices are elevated, and that affordability is crimping the ability of buyers—es-\npecially first-time homebuyers—to come up with down payments and make monthly payments. The ratio of\naverage homeownership costs—of which mortgage debt service is the largest component—to average household\ndisposable income, as measured by the Bank of Canada’s affordability ratio, has recently risen to its highest level\nsince the late 1990s (see Chart 1). The five-year mortgage rate has spiked to 5.6%, up more than 200 basis points\nsince the start of 2022, its highest level since January 2009. Meanwhile, higher energy prices caused by Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine are having a more profound impact on households’ budgets and their ability to pay.\nThe RPS Metropolitan Composite index—a weighted average of 13 major metropolitan areas—fell for the\nsecond consecutive month in August, causing the year-over-year appreciation in house prices to decelerate\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 2Chart 1: Housing Increasingly Out of Reach\n12 0.50\n11\n0.45\n10\n0.40\n9\n0.35\n8\n0.30\n7\n6 0.25\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\nRatio, median home value to median family income % (L) Affordability index (R)\nSources: CMHC, Bank of Canada, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Month 2022 1\nto 13.8%, its slowest pace in a year and a half. Other indexes have had a similar slowdown. Falling afford-\nability and increasing mortgage rates over the year have translated into more elevated housing finance\ncosts and contributed to slower house price appreciation shackling demand. Existing-home sales have\ndropped over the past six months and are now at their slowest pace since summer 2020, according to the\nCanadian Real Estate Association.\nThe decline in sales has been largest in Vancouver and Toronto (see Chart 2). The effects first of falling\naffordability and then of higher mortgage rates have taken their toll in these large metro areas. Between\nearly 2021 and August of this year, total sales have fallen by nearly two-fifths in Vancouver and by close to\none-third in Toronto. The decline in sales has been steady but much more gradual in Montreal. The smaller\nprovinces have also been affected, but home sales have so far remained above pre-pandemic levels in the\nPrairie Provinces and most of Atlantic Canada as buyers in relatively affordable markets are less sensitive to\ninterest rate hikes.\nDespite the recent decrease in homebuyer demand, supply-side constraints on the housing market remain\ntight. The existing-home market remains relatively undersupplied, with the inventory-to-sales ratio at 3.5\nmonths of sales in August, up from 1.6 months in January. A balanced market is generally considered to be\nfive to six months of inventory.\nConstruction activity yet to recede meaningfully\nHomebuilding activity remains robust unlike the resale market—but this segment of the market lags.\nThough the pace of new housing starts has slowed, it remains elevated by historical levels. According to\nthe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., housing starts registered 267,443 units at a seasonally adjusted\nannualized rate in July, barely down from last year’s average. The number of homes under construction now\ntops 340,000, which is a historic high.\nSupply-side challenges remain, however. The ratio of permits to starts suggests that projects are being\npostponed or delayed. Permits are not being readily converted into starts, implying that crews are delaying\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 3Chart 2: Sales Activity Takes a Big Hit in Toronto and Vancouver\n% change yrago\nVancouver\nToronto\nHalifax\nOttawa\nCanada\nMontreal\nWinnipeg\nEdmonton\nCalgary\nRegina\n-45 -40 -35 -30 -25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15\nSources: CREA, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 2\nor abandoning projects because of unfavorable economic outlooks or supply-side constraints. Permits are\nuseful leading indicators of economic swings, but because they have not materially declined lately, the\nclimbing ratio may be more indicative of residual building-material bottlenecks.\nThe ratio of starts to completions provides further insight. Across single-family and multifamily projects,\nstarts are noticeably outpacing completions, particularly single-family units (see Chart 3). This is mainly\nbecause projects are breaking ground but taking longer to finish. According to the Canadian Home Builders’\nAssociation, construction timelines were delayed by 10 weeks on average because of supply-chain issues in\nthe first quarter of 2022—and this number has likely increased.\nChart 3: Starts Outpace Completions\nTrailing 4-qtr total, NSA, ths\n260\n240\n220\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nCompletions Starts\nSources: CMHC, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Month 2022 3\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 4House price appreciation coming off the boil\nThe pandemic sent demand for single-family housing through the roof, with price growth of more than 41%\nin the span of the last two years, according to the RPS Metropolitan Composite index. The causes are both\nstructural and cyclical. Demographic trends supported increased demand as the millennial generation en-\ntered their 30s, prime years for starting families and buying homes. Simultaneously, baby boomers showed\nno sign of downsizing.1 Remote work has also shifted the relative value of residential real estate versus\ncommercial offices.\nIn addition, demand was pulled forward by record-low interest rates. Buyers rushed into the market, at-\ntracted by the cheap financing or the need for more space for remote work and learning during the pan-\ndemic, while others turned to real estate given the paltry returns offered by savings accounts and bonds.\nThese forces conspired to create a large imbalance between supply and demand.\nNot only was the pace of house price appreciation remarkable, the breadth of increases across provinces\nand metropolitan areas was equally breathtaking. Over the past year, out of 33 metro areas, prices rose by\nmore than 10% in 29 metro areas while it rose by more than 20% in 18 metro areas. This contrasts with the\n10 metro areas that grew by more than 10% and two metro areas that grew by more than 20% during the\n2006 housing boom.\nThis was mainly because the pandemic greatly accelerated migration in Canada, with many people moving\nfrom the densest parts of cities to the suburbs and rural areas. This migration has supercharged growth in\nmany smaller metropolitan areas and led some markets to astronomical valuations compared with a few\nyears ago. This is evident from the faster house appreciation seen in the RPS Canadian Composite Index,\nwhich is a median average of 1,500 forward sortation areas and the broader national picture (see Chart 4).\nChart 4: Prices Rose at a Faster Pace in Smaller Markets\n% change yrago\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nRPS Metropolitan Composite Index RPS Canadian Composite Index\nSources: RPS, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Month 2022 4\n1 https://www.chba.ca/CHBADocs/CHBA/HousingCanada/Information-Statistics/CHBA-Performance-Trends-2017.pdf\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 5House price growth remains strong by historical standards but is cooling rapidly in many markets, and more\ndownward pressure has been added following the BoC’s move to raise its target for the overnight rate by\n100 basis points in July and 75 basis points again in September.\nThe slowdown is even more evident when examining house price dynamics in the seven months between\nJanuary and August 2022, as shown in Charts 5 and 6. In January, several metro areas still had current an-\nnualized house price growth that equaled or exceeded year-over-year growth. By August, only Saskatoon\nand Regina fit that category. Halifax, Victoria and Ottawa house price appreciation has slowed but is still\nmaking solid gains.\nChart 5: Good HPI Growth Early This Year…\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n-5\n-10\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 5\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 6\nghc\n%\nylretrauq\ndezilaunnA\nComposite index, 1-yr vs. 1-qtr performance, 3-mo MA, Jan 2022\nImproving Expanding\nPrairies Ontario British Columbia\nVancouver Toronto\nCalgary\nEdmonton Quebec Hamilton\nSaskatoon Halifax\nVictoria\nOttawa\n% change yrago\nWinnipeg Montreal\nRegina\nQuébec and Nova Scotia\nContracting Slipping\nSources: RPS, Moody’s Analytics Note: Bubble size indicates # of households\nChart 6: …But It Is Starting to Slow Down\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n-5\n-10\n-15\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 6\nghc\n%\nylretrauq\ndezilaunnA\nComposite index, 1-yr vs. 1-qtr performance, 3-mo MA, Aug 2022\nImproving Expanding\nPrairies Ontario British Columbia\nToronto\nWinnipeg\nRegina\nCalgary Vancouver Halifax\nVictoria\nSaskatoon Hamilton\nEdmonton Québec % change yr ago\nMontreal\nOttawa Québec and Nova Scotia\nContracting Slipping\nSources: RPS, Moody’s Analytics Note: Bubble size indicates # of householdsRates will rise further\nAfter two years of rock-bottom interest rates, the BoC is rapidly raising its target for the overnight policy\nrate. We anticipate that the bank will likely end its tightening cycle at the end of 2022 when the overnight\nrate reaches 3.5% and goes no further as global conditions deteriorate and inflation decelerates. At this\nlevel, interest rates cause demand destruction and should put significant downward pressure on prices. We\nexpect that in the second half of 2023, the BoC will begin slowly trimming its policy rate back to the neu-\ntral level of 2.5%—the rate that neither stimulates nor constrains economic growth.\nThe rising policy rate entails implications for the entire yield curve and, perhaps most crucially, the five-year\nmortgage rate (see Chart 7). Higher rates and the significant deterioration in housing affordability will re-\nduce the number of potential new buyers. Moreover, mortgages taken out during the pandemic boom will\nbegin resetting at higher rates, given that the standard Canadian mortgage product resets every five years.\nChart 7: Interest Rates Will Rise\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n16 17 18 19 20 21 22F 23F 24F 25F\n1-yr mortgage rate 5-yr mortgage rate Policy rate\nSources: BoC, CMHC, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Month 2022 7\nThe baseline forecast\nThe housing market is poised for a rougher landing in the next few years but will begin to recover in late\n2024. The ultra-low interest rates that juiced up demand during the pandemic have now become the mod-\nestly higher interest rates that are slamming the brakes on home sales. Inflation is also eroding purchasing\npower as monthly budgets get tighter.\nAs businesses see flatlining demand, hiring will pause. The labour market will likely muddle through the remain-\nder of 2022 and the first half of 2023 with a mix of small gains and losses that amount to next-to-zero net em-\nployment growth. Problematically, demographics and a growing labour force mean that more workers will be\nspending a longer time looking for jobs, sending the unemployment rate drifting back closer to 6% next year.\nProblematically, investment is going to be unable to pick up the slack. Residential investment is highly sen-\nsitive to interest rates. Prices have far outpaced the fundamentals of income (see Chart 8) and demograph-\nics and Canadians are carrying dangerously high debt loads, which make them relatively more sensitive to\nfluctuations in interest rates.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 7Chart 8: House Price Appreciation Far Exceeds Fundamentals\n% change yrago\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\nMedian family income House prices\nSources: RPS, Statistics Canada, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Month 2022 8\nThe combination of increased borrowing costs, elevated inflation, and a softening labour market spells the\nend for the housing boom. Affordability issues have been mounting—and they will likely worsen in the near\nterm. Demand is expected to soften as a result while supply-chain bottlenecks continue to weigh on hous-\ning completions and sales in the short term. We project house prices will suffer a peak-to-trough decline\nof about 10% by the early 2024 (see Chart 9). However, it is important to recall that house prices surged\nduring the pandemic. The pullback is part of the economy’s normalization.\nChart 9: House Prices Will Pull Back\nRPS composite house price index, % change yrago\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n16 17 18 19 20 21 22F 23F 24F 25F\nSources: RPS, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Month 2022 9\nSupply-chain bottlenecks are easing but will weigh on housing starts in the intermediate term. Completions\nwill rise in the coming year given the number of homes under construction.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 8The regional forecast\nThe macroeconomic forecast implies a deceleration of national house price growth as higher mortgage\nrates weigh on demand. Some of the undervalued housing markets, especially in Alberta and Saskatchewan,\nwill do better despite weaker economic fundamentals precisely because they have retained better afford-\nability, while Montreal will see downward pressure on house prices for at least the next year (see Chart 10).\nChart 10: Montreal, Halifax Hit the Most\n% change yrago\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n19 20 21 22F 23F 24F 25F 26F 27F\nCalgary Edmonton Vancouver Halifax Toronto Montreal Saskatoon\nSources: RPS, Moody’s Analytics\nPresentation Title, Month 2022 10\nTable 1 presents the dynamics of the short-term forecast for detached single-family house prices. The\nsecond column shows the rate of over- or undervaluation for all metro areas. In geographies with highly\novervalued housing, house price growth would normally start to slow because of a combination of reduced\naffordability, excess construction, and a possible decline in mortgage debt performance leading to distress\nsales.2 It is worth noting that nationally, mortgages in arrears are 0.15% as of May, compared with an aver-\nage of 0.3% for the past 10 years, and are at the lowest levels recorded in the past 30 years, as reported by\nthe Canadian Bankers Association. Highly undervalued metro areas are likely to see more opportunistic pur-\nchases, either to flip dwellings or to make them available on the rental market, with resulting appreciation\nas such purchases start to act on a limited supply of homes.\nSerious overvaluation is not limited to Toronto but also includes the surrounding Golden Horseshoe region.\nHowever, their house prices have also shown less sensitivity to overvaluation in the historical data since\n2005, so they will likely experience less downward price pressure.\nBritish Columbia housing markets are overvalued, not just for Vancouver but for the other three metro ar-\neas as well. Given their overvaluation, the British Columbia metro areas will continue to have downward\npull on their house prices due to reduced affordability.\nBy contrast, overvaluation is not a problem in the Prairie regions. In fact, the Calgary, Edmonton, Regina\nand Saskatoon metro areas are all seriously undervalued despite recent price increases and would thus face\n2 The usual caveat for measuring overvaluation continues to apply: A high degree of overvaluation is not a surefire guarantee that house prices will\nstart to correct in the near future, especially if wealth inflows affecting local housing markets continue unabated.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 9an upward push after the period of mortgage rate increases is over. Winnipeg is the only metro area in the\nPrairies that is valued fairly.\nQuebec presents important contrasts. Montreal, Sherbrooke and Trois-Rivieres are the only metropolitan\nareas in Quebec not in the “correctly valued” range of plus or minus 10% and will continue to experience\na downward pull on their house prices due to reduced affordability. House prices in Montreal have also\nshown greater sensitivity to overvaluation in the historical data since 2005. They will likely experience more\ndownward price pressure compared with Toronto or Vancouver.\nThe third and fourth columns of Table 1 show annualized single-family house price appreciation in the\nfirst and second quarters of 2022. The strongest appreciation rates were observed in smaller Ontario met-\nro areas, including Greater Sudbury, Kingston, London, Barrie and Windsor, as well as Saint John in New\nBrunswick, Sherbrooke in Quebec, Kelowna in British Columbia, and Halifax in Nova Scotia. None of the\nmetropolitan areas reported declines in the second quarter of 2022. However, the pace of appreciation\nhas decelerated in most metro areas except Regina, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Sherbrooke, Kelowna and\nGreater Sudbury.\nThe fifth column of Table 1 shows the forecast of single-family homes in the second quarter of 2023 on a\nyear-ago basis. The largest corrections will be in those metro areas that have a combination of recent decel-\neration in house price appreciation and high overvaluation. In line with slowing national appreciation, most\nof the metro areas are expected to undergo a price correction. Of the large metro areas, we expect that\nonly Montreal will see the steepest decline in prices. Meanwhile, house price appreciation will strengthen\nin Calgary, Edmonton and Saskatoon, advancing at the fastest rate along with Kelowna and Winnipeg. This\nreflects affordability conditions that are solid by historical standards.\nThe last column shows house price growth in the second quarter of 2024, where the inertial effects from\nhistorical house price growth are no longer expected to be as strong and forecasts are driven mainly by re-\nversion to trend and by sensitivity to changes in mortgage rates. The correction for most of the metro areas\nwill continue; house prices will not recover until late 2024. House price appreciation will strengthen in Cal-\ngary, Edmonton and Saskatoon, advancing at a faster rate.\nOn average, the Canada metro areas will experience significantly slower house price growth over the next\nfive years, though the decelerations will be sharper for Montreal, while the Prairie metro areas will under-\ngo price increases. The more pessimistic house price forecast is consistent with intended policy effects of\nthe BoC to improve affordability and reduce mortgage risks, which will have at least partial success in the\nmedium term.\nRisks\nDeclining affordability caused by rising interest rates remains the most important risk to housing demand\nas current home valuations are fragile. Gains during the pandemic far exceeded fundamentals and rising\ninterest rates are eroding demand. While it is true that house price appreciation has eased, concerns remain\nbecause prices are resting on a much higher base. Further, the pace at which we got here is also jarring con-\nsidering average household income growth has continued to fall behind.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 10Inflation shock is next in line. If energy and agricultural prices flare back up, then the clock resets on infla-\ntion’s pivot, interest rates will go even higher, and the prospect of recession becomes more likely. The infla-\ntion shock would likely also lead to layoffs as sentiment weakens. The combination of higher interest rates\nand rising unemployment would amplify the stress in the housing market.\nCanadian households’ elevated debt levels would not only exacerbate the downturn; the persistence of\nthese burdens would restrain the pace of recovery.\nDownside risks include supply-side constraints, which will drive up prices in the short term and could cause\nfrustrated buyers to sour on the prospects of homeownership.\nFavorable demographics and an improving labour market provide the most significant upside risks. House-\nhold balance sheets are strong overall, with savings exceeding pre-pandemic levels for many households.\nMany young adults continue to aspire to become homeowners, provided they can find homes to buy within\ntheir price range.\nOverall, the risks are equally balanced, with demographics providing structural strength and interest rates\nand supply-chain bottlenecks presenting cyclical challenges.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 11Table 1: Canada Subnational Forecast, Detached Single-Family House Price Value\n% deviation from % change % change % change % change\ntrend price, annualized, annualized, yr ago, yr ago,\n2022Q2 2022Q1 2022Q2 2023Q2 2024Q2\nAlberta -20.80 15.18 15.06 4.65 5.75\nCalgary, census metropolitan area -26.42 20.77 19.69 5.82 5.80\nEdmonton, census metropolitan area -30.50 10.85 12.27 2.94 5.68\nBritish Columbia 8.76 31.30 16.09 -5.57 -6.31\nAbbotsford, census metropolitan area 65.27 48.23 14.57 -11.72 -12.47\nKelowna, census metropolitan area 16.53 30.77 32.16 4.78 -1.92\nVancouver, census metropolitan area 33.42 31.88 14.71 -6.24 -6.25\nVictoria, census metropolitan area 32.30 31.20 22.12 -3.26 -6.75\nManitoba -1.25 17.63 16.45 0.85 0.24\nWinnipeg, census metropolitan area 2.15 18.45 17.62 0.85 0.24\nNew Brunswick 19.27 38.39 32.82 0.04 -9.47\nMoncton, census metropolitan area 5.42 34.97 21.89 1.46 -4.67\nSaint John, census metropolitan area 29.92 43.01 33.71 -1.45 -14.64\nNewfoundland and Labrador -11.04 15.20 10.42 0.06 2.80\nSt. John’s, census metropolitan area -16.09 15.49 10.43 0.06 2.80\nNova Scotia 42.74 34.67 28.10 -6.96 -15.66\nHalifax, census metropolitan area 29.17 37.93 30.87 -6.96 -15.66\nOntario 25.43 29.35 14.47 -6.69 -7.31\nBarrie, census metropolitan area 84.71 45.05 16.43 -6.48 -7.60\nBrantford, census metropolitan area 86.76 42.81 17.48 -6.40 -8.27\nGreater Sudbury, census metropolitan area 48.84 41.97 44.49 5.78 -4.78\nGuelph, census metropolitan area 75.83 29.88 15.14 -6.55 -7.64\nHamilton, census metropolitan area 97.35 38.62 16.85 -6.85 -8.84\nKingston, census metropolitan area 52.89 20.52 20.97 -3.21 -6.37\nKitchener, census metropolitan area 66.51 39.98 14.86 -6.79 -7.36\nLondon, census metropolitan area 87.87 39.74 20.13 -5.17 -7.96\nOttawa-Gatineau, census metropolitan area 27.40 18.30 18.15 -3.60 -5.26\nOshawa, census metropolitan area 79.45 40.89 12.20 -7.98 -7.46\nPeterborough, census metropolitan area 123.56 31.66 8.35 -11.15 -10.55\nSt. Catharines-Niagara, census metropolitan area 127.26 30.15 17.83 -6.68 -9.66\nThunder Bay, census metropolitan area 32.85 26.64 19.29 -4.95 -7.70\nToronto, census metropolitan area 57.26 26.90 12.03 -7.45 -7.17\nWindsor, census metropolitan area 127.02 37.83 30.90 -1.16 -8.37\nPrince Edward Island 36.92 13.14 18.37 -8.53 -12.97\nQuebec 23.48 18.75 16.82 -8.51 -11.20\nMontreal, census metropolitan area 39.17 17.45 15.87 -10.43 -13.72\nQuebec, census metropolitan area 0.27 16.99 16.67 1.53 0.95\nSaguenay, census metropolitan area 6.96 14.75 5.97 -5.21 -1.30\nSherbrooke, census metropolitan area 22.92 30.20 30.35 -0.44 -8.23\nTrois-Rivieres, census metropolitan area 19.90 28.65 15.44 -6.46 -7.89\nSaskatchewan -22.03 2.38 9.02 3.09 7.39\nRegina, census metropolitan area -22.97 -1.60 2.71 -0.69 5.15\nSaskatoon, census metropolitan area -34.80 5.35 12.45 5.76 8.85\nSources: RPS, Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Canada Housing Market outlook 12About the Author\nAbhilasha Singh is an economist at Moody’s Analytics, where she leads model development, validation, and fore-\ncasting for global subnational economies.
