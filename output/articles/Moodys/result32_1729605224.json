These uncertainties can\nsignificantly impact a bank's performance, risk profile, and strategic direction. Scenario\nanalysis and benchmarking are critical tools for navigating this complexity, and developing\nNumber of\ninformed, resilient strategies.\nCCAR banks\nScenario analysis involves creating and evaluating multiple plausible future states based in the 2024\non different assumptions about how key uncertainties might evolve. It helps banks assess cycle\nthe impacts of external and internal factors on their operations, financial performance, and\nstrategic objectives. By examining a range of possible futures, banks can identify potential\nrisks and opportunities that might not be apparent through traditional financial forecasting\ntechniques, which often rely on linear extrapolations of past trends.\nThe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is a regulatory framework\nintroduced by the Federal Reserve to ensure that the largest U.S. banks have robust capital\nNumber of\nplanning processes and adequate capital to continue operations throughout economic and\nscenarios\ncredit stress. While CCAR targets large banks’ performance under significant stress, its\nincluding the\nprinciples and practices are beneficial for any financial institution to ensure financial\nnew\nstability, confident strategic direction, and sound risk management. The exercise is not exploratory\nsolely about losses—it includes a comprehensive view of the entire balance sheet and scenarios\nincome statement to evaluate capital buffers under different scenarios. Useful strategic\nconsiderations resulting from this process include:\na) How will revenues and expenses shift in different economic environments?\nb) How will balance growth projections and deposit gathering efforts fare under different\nstates of the world?\nc) How do different product mixes impact returns, what is the optimal profitability under\ndifferent macro-driven assumptions?\nCCAR requires scenario analysis and financial modeling capabilities that are highly applicable\nbeyond the regulatory exercise. These capabilities provide management an empirical, multi-\nscenario view of the potential growth and resilience of the bank. This confidence interval around\nfuture outcomes clarifies strategies and enhances decision confidence—the most important\nlesson institutions not subject to CCAR should take away from the exercise. We’re seeing\ninstitutions of all sizes strategically investing in these capabilities to bring forward-looking clarity\nto boardroom decisions in a complex risk environment.\nCCAR results inform improvements to business strategies, but the exercise inputs and framework\nare equally useful as a guide for risk management practices (including process governance,\nscenario development, modeling, board and management engagement, documentation, and\nauditability) at growing institutions. The 10+ years of CCAR exercises highlight evolutions in\nregulatory expectations for larger banks—a bellwether for what regulatory expectations may\ntrickle down to smaller institutions over time. Banks approaching, or above $10 billion in total\nassets should look to CCAR as a roadmap for growing wisely and staying ahead of regulatory\nexpectations.\nTo bring the processes of scenario analysis and benchmarking to life, we provide key illustrations\nthroughout this paper:\n• Summarize CCAR best practices that can be scaled to any institution.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 3Growth Strategy\n• Illustrate scenario analysis and benchmarking fundamentals using:\no Analysis of scenario evolution from 2023 to 2024\no Demonstration of how financials can be modeled for any firm from FDIC Call\nReport data\no Application of 2024 CCAR scenarios and financial statement models to obtain\nindustry-level and institution-specific results.\nCCAR PRACTICES FOR EVERY INSTITUTION\nThe Federal Reserve provides comprehensive documentation for the past 10+ years of CCAR\nexercises. Each year’s release provides a wealth of information, benchmarks, and best practices.\nIt is publicly available, allowing all interested parties to review and understand the CCAR process\nand its implications for the industry. Table 1 provides practical guidelines, scalable to any\ninstitution, that we recommend based on historic CCAR releases and our decades of experience\nwith both prudential regulators and industry participants.\nTable 1 - CCAR Requirements & Best Practices for Non-CCAR Institutions\nCCAR Requirement Guidance for non-CCAR banks\nRisk Process Develop robust processes to capture Implementing a similar governance\nManagement firm-specific vulnerabilities and risks.

The full potential of the activity\nis unlocked with two key types of\nanalytics:\n1. Financial statement forecasts -\ncredible forecasts are\nconsistent with macro\nassumptions, account for\ncyclical economic factors, are\ntransparent and fully\ndocumented.\n2.

While scenario analysis focuses on\npreparing for a range of potential futures by understanding the impact of various external and\ninternal factors, benchmarking introduces a comparative dimension to this analysis, measuring a\nbank's performance, practices, and strategies against those of leading peers or industry\nstandards. Integrating benchmarking with scenario analysis can provide a more nuanced,\ncompetitive, and actionable approach to strategy development.\nSome foundational areas of understanding inform the selection and interpretation of benchmarks\nfrom the CCAR or other scenario-based exercises:\na) Calibration of Scenario and Financial Assumptions: Benchmarking can help validate\nthe assumptions used in scenario analysis by providing a reality check against industry\nnorms and trends. If a bank's scenarios or performance expectations are significantly\nmore optimistic or pessimistic than the benchmarks, it may prompt a reevaluation of\nthose assumptions, leading to more realistic and actionable strategic insights.\nb) Enhanced Understanding of Resilience and Performance Drivers: Through\nbenchmarking, banks can analyze not just their own resilience and adaptability under\ndifferent scenarios, but also how these attributes compare with those of their peers. This\ncan uncover key drivers of performance and resilience, highlighting areas where the bank\nmay need to strengthen its strategies or operations.\nc) Regulatory Compliance and Capital Adequacy: For banks subject to CCAR,\nbenchmarking within scenario analysis must explicitly consider regulatory expectations\nand thresholds for capital adequacy. This means comparing not only operational and\nfinancial metrics with peers but also how well each bank maintains capital buffers above\nregulatory minimums under stress scenarios. Benchmarking can help banks identify best\npractices in capital conservation and risk-weighted asset optimization.\nd) Comparative Insights for Strategic Positioning: Benchmarking allows banks to position\ntheir scenario analysis outcomes against industry best practices or leading competitors.\nBy comparing how different banks might fare under similar scenarios, benchmarking\nhelps identify strategic gaps and opportunities for improvement. This comparative insight\ncan inform more competitive strategic decisions, support growth, resilience, and\nshareholder value, even in adverse conditions.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 6Growth Strategy\nIncorporating benchmarking into scenario analysis provides multi-dimensional nuance in\nstrategic planning. It not only prepares institutions for a variety of future states but also ensures\nthat their strategies are competitive, grounded in industry realities, and focused on areas of\nstrategic importance. This integrated approach helps banks navigate the complex regulatory\nlandscape while maintaining a strong focus on long-term resilience and competitiveness.\nCCAR ILLUSTRATIVE ANALYSIS\nIn the remainder of the paper, we provide an integrated illustration of scenario analysis,\nbenchmarking, and financial statement modeling. Our illustration relies on three key inputs:\na) 2024 CCAR Scenarios – scenarios start in the first quarter of 2024 and extend through\nthe first quarter of 2027. The 2024 exercise includes the typical Baseline and Severely\nAdverse scenarios but adds two exploratory scenarios that evaluate additional risks\nhighlighted by banking system disruptions in the spring of 2023. To highlight year over\nyear scenario changes, we will run the 2023 Baseline and Severely Adverse scenarios in\nparallel with their 2024 iterations.\nb) FDIC Call Report Data through 2023Q4 – to develop industry benchmarks, our illustration\nwill subject all U.S. banks to the 2024 CCAR scenarios. These benchmarks leverage a\ntop-down analysis that supports the identification of industry trends, but actual results if\neach bank performed the CCAR exercise would vary. The relationship between historic\ndata and scenario inputs is a key part of our analytical approach. Incorporating historical\ndata through 2023Q4 provides the most current view of actual industry conditions\navailable at the date of our analysis.\nc) Moody’s Call Report Forecast – to measure the effects of macroeconomic variables on\nincome and balance sheet projections, we leverage proprietary financial statement\nmodeling capabilities. These tools provide forecasts of income and balance sheet\nstatements at the industry, firm and peer group levels using FDIC Call Report data.\nFinancial institutions of all sizes leverage this tool in their own analyses to overcome the\nsparse internal data and the influence of idiosyncratic factors that make it difficult to\ndevelop reliable financial statement forecasts.\nThe focus of our illustration is to understand major differences across scenarios and emphasize\nfoundational takeaways useful for an institutions’ early capital planning exercises. In particular,\nunderstanding how these results could be used to reveal the potential impact the 2024 scenarios\nmay have on your own financial metrics and forward guidance.\n2024 CCAR MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS – WHAT’S NEW?\nEach year Moody’s releases scenarios based on the Federal Reserve (Fed) scenarios but\nexpanded to cover all macroeconomic variables an institution may need to run their own stress\ntest. The Fed scenarios typically include 16 macroeconomic variables. Table 2 illustrates the\nevolution of these scenarios over the past year. Attention to this progression provides insight into\nsupervisors’ evolving views of risks materializing in the banking system. For non-CCAR banks,\nthese scenarios may reveal outliers for which banks did not have mitigation plans and prompt\naction on their part.\nThe Baseline scenario is designed to incorporate prevailing market expectations, so it is built\nfrom average projections compiled from a survey of professional forecasters. The 2024 Severely\nAdverse scenario models a severe global recession, including prolonged declines in both\nresidential and commercial real estate prices, which spill over into the corporate sector and\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 7Growth Strategy\naffect investment sentiment. What drew our attention, is that the behavior of credit-related\nmacroeconomic variables remains substantially consistent with prior year assumptions. We use\nthe magnitude of peak-to-trough change in each variable for this comparison:\n• Unemployment (unchanged at 4.4);\n• Home Price Index (25.3 to 23.9); and\n• CRE Price Index (unchanged at 38.1).\nRegulators appear to emphasize steep declines in interest rates. 2024 peak to trough changes are\namplified more than 20% over 2023 changes in multiple variables, including 3-month Treasury (1.6\nto 2.0), 5-year Treasury (0.4 to 0.9) and Prime rate (1.6 to 2.0).\nTable 2 - Scenario Comparison: 2023 vs 2024\nBeyond the standard Baseline and Severely Adverse scenarios, two exploratory scenarios (new\nfor the 2024 exercise) focus on inflation and liquidity-related risks. Reflecting the opportunity for\nnon-credit issues to impact multiple aspects of bank performance, the two additional scenarios\nevaluate funding and market risks, and help banks prepare for a range of conditions. Exploratory\nA models a combination of a moderate recession, increasing inflation and rising interest rates.\nExploratory B considers a more severe, global recession with persistently high inflation and\ninterest rates2. The exploratory analysis is distinct from the stress test and will explore\nhypothetical risks to the broader banking system, rather than focusing on firm-specific results.\nBUILDING RELIABLE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PROJECTIONS\nProjections of the balance sheet and income statements are a common struggle, with diversity in\nthe level of sophistication between credit-related items and line items like Pre-Provision Net\nRevenue (PPNR). PPNR is critical for understanding an institution’s ability to earn its way out of\nstress but is complex to model due to its dynamic variability with both macroeconomic conditions\nand contributory financial statement line items. Credit projections are typically robust and\nleverage complex models3 with well-defined links to macro-economic variables. Regulatory\nscrutiny over the past 5 years advanced PPNR modeling capabilities at CCAR banks. This\n2 Moody’s Briefing on CCAR Scenarios 2024 (recorded webcast) available at: https://events.moodys.com/mc16893-wbn-\n2024-mau22841-ccar-scenarios\n3 We refer to CCAR bank’s models here; smaller institutions’ model sophistication should be scaled to their size and risk\nprofile.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 8Growth Strategy\nsophistication is imperative given this year’s increased focus on interest rate volatility, which\nimpacts the balance sheet differently than the credit emphasis of prior years’ scenarios.\nNon-CCAR banks typically lack historical time series data on PPNR and struggle to link PPNR\nprojections to macro-economic variables. These banks are also typically more impacted than\nlarger banks by idiosyncratic management actions, merger or system consolidations, etc. These\nchallenges and the hard-to-define link to macro-economic variables represent a key obstacle for\nscenario analysis, benchmarking, and strategic planning at many institutions.\nUnderstanding the challenge that banks face in creating timely, credible forecasts consistent\nwith macro assumptions, that account for cyclical economic factors and are transparent and fully\ndocumented, MOODY’S created a suite of models called the Call Report Forecast4 (CRF). CRF is\nan econometric forecast of the income statement and balance sheet based on FDIC Call Report\ndata. The industry-based model more accurately captures the effects of macroeconomic\nvariables than a single entity can and overcomes major limitations due to sparse/noisy data\ninfluenced by bank-specific factors. This process also allows us to forecast performance for\nindividual institutions and/or peer groups.\nHere a brief overview of the steps in creating the forecasts under different economic scenarios:\nFirst step is to compute the industry-level data, we aggregate the individual call reports from all\nthe active banks at any given time. This level of aggregation helps create more meaningful\ncorrelations with macroeconomic data. The next step is to carve out smaller cohorts or\n'segments' of banks based on asset size and region combinations and use a market share\napproach (of these smaller cohorts in the entire industry) to accurately capture any idiosyncratic\nbehavior. Finally, to get to the forecast for an individual bank, we locate the said bank in its\n'segment' and apply the growth rate of the forecast trajectories of the segment to the bank, for\neach individual line item. The industry model acts as an anchor for the entire modeling tier\nstructure and industry forecasts are often used as qualitative adjustments when data/model\noutcomes become unintuitive as we move to more granular levels of modeling i.e., segments and\nthen banks. CRF can be leveraged for regulatory stress testing as well as capital planning,\nstrategic planning, and budgeting5.\nFigure 1 - CRF Forecast Development Process\n4 Call report forecast methodology document can be provided upon request. Contact the author for more information.\n5 CRF sensitivities can be applied to budgets to create upside and downside scenarios that are conditioned by economic\nscenarios and provide a view that is aligned with the capital plan.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 9Growth Strategy\nWe utilized CRF to provide benchmarks for industry-wide and CCAR firm-level results. Below we\ndiscuss highlights of the exercise and include an appendix of the key forecasted items under the\nSeverely Adverse scenario, other scenario data is available on demand.\nSCENARIO ANALYSIS & BENCHMARKING RESULTS\nIn our study, we examine the results of the industry and CCAR banks under the CCAR scenarios.\nThis analysis aggregates industry performance by financial statement line item when combining\n2023Q4 actuals from call report data for 4,681 FDIC insured banks, with the Baseline and\nSeverely Adverse scenarios from 2023 and 2024. This allows us to understand the year-over-year\nchanges in the CCAR scenario assumptions and establish industry performance benchmarks for\nunderstanding firm-level results. We also provide results highlights for the Exploratory Scenario A\nand B for the CCAR banks segment.\nINDUSTRY WIDE ANALYSIS AND CCAR BANK SEGMENT OVERVIEW\nWe built complete financial statement forecasts for each bank but highlight key line items that\nreflect the emphasis of the CCAR 2024 scenarios and are most relevant to bank strategies in the\ncurrent macroeconomic environment6: Net Loans and Leases, Net Interest Income, Pre-Provision\nNet Revenue and Deposits. Consistent with CCAR’s traditional emphasis on credit and capital,\nwe also provide forecast and historic benchmarks (asset quality, capital adequacy, liquidity,\nprofitability) for the CCAR bank segment in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively.\nNet Loans and Leases\nCRF Net Loans and Leases forecasts are built from GDP, property price and income variables\nwithin the CCAR scenarios. Peak to trough severity for these variables was significantly higher in\nthe 2024 scenarios than in 2023. Altogether, this produces a more significant drop in industry\nloan and lease totals throughout the forecast with a related decline in PPNR results. Residential\nand CRE loans compose a material portion of the anticipated decline in volume.\n6 CRF provides these results at a much more granular segment level for bank size and geographic dispersion.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 10Growth Strategy\nFigure 2 - Industry Net Loans & Leases ($Bn)\nFor the CCAR bank segment we observe that the drop in loan and lease growth for the severely\nadverse scenario (when rates decrease) is proportionately larger than for the Industry segment,\nwhich is potentially a side effect of larger banks dealing in larger notional loan amounts. The\nExploratory scenarios reveal that in a scenario where the Federal Reserve is fighting inflation by\nincreasing rates, the impact on loan growth is not as severe as it would be in a deep recession as\nportrayed by the Severely Adverse scenario. It is not surprising to see Scenario A impact being\nless significant, on loan growth, than Scenario B given that Scenario B involves a much deeper\nglobal recession, although rates in Scenario A stay much higher and for longer than in Scenario\nB. This indicates that loan growth/attrition is more strongly correlated to the state of the\neconomy than the level of rates.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 11Growth Strategy\nFigure 3 - CCAR Net Loans & Leases ($Bn)\nNet Interest Income\nNet Interest Income represents interest revenues minus the increasing cost of funding observed\nsince the Federal Reserve began hiking rates in 2022. The impact is very pronounced under the\nSeverely Adverse scenario where the magnitude of rate declines is greater than in previous years.\nThe higher level of rates at the starting point of the forecast (reflecting prevailing rates in\n2023Q4), makes the drop more pronounced than in previous years.\nFigure 4 - Industry Net Interest Income ($Bn)\nWe observe a similar pattern in CCAR banks as observed in Industry banks across the 2024\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 12Growth Strategy\nSeverely Adverse scenario and Exploratory scenarios. The Exploratory A and B scenarios reveal a\npattern not captured by the Severely Adverse scenario and that is the effect of higher rates due\nto the Federal Reserve combating rising inflation more aggressively, especially in the Exploratory\nA for which rates are kept much higher for much longer than in the Exploratory B scenario.\nFigure 5 – CCAR Net Interest Income ($Bn)\nThe most important assumption to analyze in your own stress test is asset and liability repricing.\nThe vastly different rate assumptions depicted in each of the scenarios above highlights the\nsignificance of interest rate risk in the current environment, and a renewed emphasis of the risk\nby prudential regulators.\nPre-provision Net Revenue\nAs we’ve highlighted both the challenge of modeling PPNR and the significance of comparison\nbetween historic and forecast values to the model result, we present an important illustration of\nboth concepts here. In 2023Q4 there is a significant spike in the noninterest expense component\nof PPNR in both industry and CCAR results. This spike reflects accruals for an FDIC Special\nAssessment7 accrued in December for payment in 2024Q1. The increased expense in historic\ndata magnifies anticipated expenses in the forecast horizon for all scenarios.\n7 https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/insurance/assessments/specialassessment-psrd.html\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 13Growth Strategy\nFigure 6 - Industry Quarterly PPNR ($Bn)\nVariances across the forecast horizon also reflect the effects of asset repricing due to interest\nrates in each scenario. Rate increases are most prominent in the Exploratory scenarios and have\na major impact on resulting PPNR forecasts.\nFigure 7 - CCAR Quarterly PPNR ($Bn)\nDeposits\nWe look at deposit behavior and emphasize the influence of interest rates on deposit mix (and to\nbenchmark related cost of funds and liquidity assumptions). Consistent with the higher rates\nreflected in the exploratory scenarios, non-interest deposits dip, whereas the time deposits surge\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 14Growth Strategy\nquite noticeably. We present the dip in non-interest-bearing deposits in Figure 9 vs. the increase\nin time deposits in Figure 8, respectively. This behavior was never top of mind for previous stress\ntesting cycles but is one that institutions should consider for both strategic impacts, and in\nanticipation of regulatory questions over the coming exam cycle.\nWe’ve emphasized deposit behavior due to its visibility in this excerpt, but the impact of higher\nrates on bank financials is diverse: higher cost of funds, liquidity and funding impacts should all\nbe considered as part of this cycle.\nFigure 8 – Industry Time Deposits ($Bn)\nFigure 9 - Industry Non-Interest-Bearing Deposits ($Bn)\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 15Growth Strategy\nFor the CCAR bank segment, the Exploratory scenarios highlight the challenge of managing\nliquidity and cost of funds in a higher for longer rate environment. The Exploratory A scenario\nproves to be more stressful than the Severely Adverse scenario leading to higher runoff of non-\ninterest-bearing deposits, but also exemplifies how deposits can jump in a higher rate\nenvironment if a bank is willing and able to accept a higher cost of funds.\nFigure 10 – CCAR Time Deposits ($Bn)\nFigure 11 - CCAR Non-Interest-Bearing Deposits ($Bn)\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 16Growth Strategy\nThe strategic modeling and overlay assumptions for the Exploratory scenarios will need to be\ntightly linked to the ability to give up profit in lieu of a more liquid balance sheet, a balancing act\nmanagement will need to ponder carefully.\nCCAR Bank Performance Ratios\nIn this next table we present a summary of CCAR segment results across major financial\nstatement line items, providing a view of historical performance juxtaposed with a view of the 9-\nquarter averages based on our call report forecast models8.

What should be noted in Table 5, is the rate of NCO for Junior Liens under the\nSeverely Adverse scenario which jumps to 34.16% and is over 3x that experienced during the\nFinancial Crisis.\nTable 5 - CCAR NCO to Total Loans by Loan Type (%)\nCONCLUSION\nWhile CCAR is designed for large banks, its principles and practices provide multiple points of\ncomparison for any financial institution to ensure financial stability, confident strategic direction,\nand sound risk management. We do not presume to have covered every CCAR or financial\nforecasting question you face, but have illustrated several key aspects of the task:\n• The importance of benchmarking and scenario analysis to multiple aspects of bank\nmanagement;\n• How readily available tools enable a sharper understanding of multi-scenario financial\nperformance of the industry, peer groups and individual firms;\n• How supervisory emphasis has evolved in response to market disruptions in the spring of\n2023 and the current interest rate environment.\nConfident decisions and resilient strategies separate good bankers from all the rest. Scenario\nanalysis and benchmarking add important dimensionality to stress testing, budgeting, strategic\nand capital planning. An empirical anchor for expert judgment is both accessible and a\ncompetitive imperative in an evolving risk environment—no matter the size of your institution.\nWhether you are beginning the journey, or at an advanced stage, CCAR best practices provide a\nroadmap for robust risk management and governance, developing stress scenarios, using models\nfor projections, involving the board and management in the process, and maintaining detailed\ndocumentation and auditability.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 19Growth Strategy\nIn addition, CCAR provides a solid\nbenchmark for your internal capital\nplan and stress test review and\nchallenge process. Moody’s\nprovides an early benchmark for\nCCAR results9 on industry and\nCCAR banks segments prior to the\nrelease of the official results.\nIf you’d like to understand how\nthese best practices can be\nimplemented for your bank’s own\nscale, provide insights, creating\noperating leverage and enhanced\nresilience for your institution.\nPlease contact us.\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS\n• CCAR – Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review; assesses whether banks are\nsufficiently capitalized to absorb losses during stressful conditions while meeting\nobligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to be able to lend to\nhouseholds and businesses.\n• CRF – Call Report Forecast; Comprehensive series of models that provide a objective\napproach for measuring the effects of macroeconomic variables on income and balance\nsheet projections.\n• PPNR – Pre-Provision Net Revenue, defined for CCAR purposes as net interest income\n(interest income minus interest expense) plus noninterest income minus noninterest\nexpense, including losses from operational-risk events and OREO expenses.\n9 We provide a table in the appendix of some important balance sheet items forecast, in addition to the ones discussed\nwithin the paper.\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 20Growth Strategy\nAPPENDIX\nTable 6 – Industry Segment 13-Quarter Forecast\nCCAR - Using Analytics to Drive Resilient Growth 21Growth Strategy\nDescription 2025Q3 2025Q4 2026Q1 2026Q2 2026Q3 2026Q4 2027Q1\nFed CCAR 2023: Severely adverse: Total assets; (Ths.
