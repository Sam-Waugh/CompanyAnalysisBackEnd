Indeed, one would have to live under the proverbial rock to not know that its share price has fallen\nsignificantly since the IPO. Until its nearly 20% rally on 24 October, Facebook was that stock that investors\n(or at least the financial media) loved to hate. What has garnered no notice, however, is that, despite the\nperformance of its shares, Facebook’s credit quality is very high, stable, among the best among its industry\npeer group and among US companies generally.\nBecause Facebook lacks an agency credit rating and does not have traded bonds or CDS from which to infer\nrisk from market spreads, Moody’s Analytics’ public Expected Default Frequency (EDF) model provides a\nunique tool to assess the credit risk of the company. Although Facebook cannot default on debt in any\nformal sense, it does, like all firms, still possess that unobservable quality that we call credit risk. Trade\ncreditors, counterparties to financial transactions, and even other stakeholders like labor have an interest in\nestimating a company’s latent credit quality. Indeed, if Facebook were ever to raise capital through private\nor public debt markets, a reliable estimate of its default probability would be required for setting terms and\npricing.\nUsing financial statement information and equity price data, the public EDF model produces a probability of\ndefault over various time horizons, typically one year.1 As of 6 November, 2012 Facebook’s one-year public\nEDF credit measure stood at 0.01% (1 bp), reflecting the firm’s relatively strong credit fundamentals and its\nleading position in its industry. Although the company is not rated by Moody’s Investors Service, its current\nEDF level is consistent with an implied rating2 of Aaa, on par with other tech industry giants such as Google\nand Apple.\nFigure 2: Facebook’s 1-Year EDF Measures vs. Internet Information Provider Industry Sector\nFigure 1 on the cover of this report shows Facebook’s EDF measure since June 2012, the earliest date for\nwhich we are able to calculate an EDF measure. As the graph shows, Facebook’s one-year EDF measure has\nremained at 0.01% since June. Also shown in the same graph are the EDF measures for a selected group of\nFacebook’s industry sector peers, such as LinkedIn, Zynga, and Groupon. Among this group, Facebook’s\nprobability of default has been very low and stable, while some of its other peers, like Groupon and Zynga,\nhave experienced rather sharp increases in their EDF measures since the first quarter of 2012. Facebook’s\ndefault risk also looks very favorable relative to the broader set of companies in the Internet Information\n1 The full public EDF methodology, “Public Firm Expected Default Frequency (EDF) Credit Measures Methodology, Performance, and Model\nExtensions,” is available on moodys.com.\n2 EDF-implied ratings are calculated by comparing a firm’s EDF level to the EDF levels of similarly rated peers. For example, as of September 2012,\nfirms with EDF levels between 0.059% and 0.077% would have received a Baa1 implied rating. The implied rating grid is updated monthly.\n2 7 NOVEMBER 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nProviders industry sector (which consists of 73 companies). Figure 2 shows the median, 25th, and 75th\npercentiles of EDF for the sector since Facebook’s May IPO. The median EDF for companies in the sector as\nof 6 November is 0.59%, an implied rating level of Ba3.\nFigure 3 shows how Facebook’s one-year EDF measure and its share price have changed since June.\nFacebook’s EDF measure has been unaffected by the approximately 40% decline in its share price, which has\nremained unchanged at 1 bp. This graph is a salutary reminder that the link between equity risk and credit\nrisk is, sometimes, quite weak. Equity investors focus on earnings, margin, and profitability, and relative to\ncreditors and credit investors, have a more near-term horizon. As long as a firm’s solvency risk is remote,\ndeviations in a firm’s operating performance from equity investors’ expectations can cause large changes in a\nfirm’s equity price. As we discuss in the next section, Facebook’s low leverage means that its equity price\ncan move in a relatively wide range without impacting its default risk.\nFigure 3: Facebook’s 1-Year EDF Measure vs. Share Price\nThe credit quality and equity performance of some of Facebook’s peers has not, however, fared as well.\nShares of some notable companies in Facebook’s industry sector, such as Zynga and Groupon, now trade\nwell below their issue prices. The default probabilities for these firms have also increased sharply since the\nstart of the year (refer back to Figure 1). As a whole, the sector has experienced healthy equity performance,\nbut also a rise in default risk. The median change in the share price for the 73 firms in the Internet\nInformation Providers industry sector is +8.6% year-to-date 2012. At the same time, the median year-to-\ndate change in the EDF measure for these companies is +12%. So while Facebook’s equity performance has\ntrailed its industry peer group, it credit quality can be said to have outperformed its sector by a wide margin.\nThe foregoing discussion clearly shows that, although equity prices are key ingredient to the EDF model,\nshare price performance and changes in the EDF measure – a key metric of credit risk – are not perfectly\ncorrelated. In the next section we analyze the fundamental drivers of Facebook’s EDF measure: financial risk\nand business risk. Facebook’s credit quality is characterized by low leverage (low financial risk) and high\nbusiness risk. Those characteristics make it similar to other firms in its sector (like LinkedIn), but are also\nfeatures shared by many companies in its industry sector that make it stand apart from other corporates. Its\nbusiness model means that its operating performance is highly volatile and sensitive to changes in consumer\ntastes and secular changes in technology.\nAnalyzing the Drivers of Facebook’s EDF Measure\nFacebook’s EDF measure has been unchanged at 0.01% since its IPO – how did we arrive at that figure? Its\nbusiness model is highly dependent on advertising revenues. What implication does that have on its credit\nrisk? What impact will the technological shift toward mobile devices potentially have on Facebook’s default\nprobability? These are the types of questions that the public EDF model is well suited to answer, and some\nof which we take up in this section. In contrast to some black-box statistical models of credit risk, the\n3 7 NOVEMBER 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\ndrivers of Moody’s Analytics’ EDF model have direct connections to basic concepts of fundamental credit\nanalysis. Studying these drivers in addition to the EDF itself helps further our understanding of a firm’s credit\nrisk.\nMoody’s Analytics’ public firm EDF model belongs to a class of credit risk models referred to as structural or\nasset value models. The basic assumption of asset value models is that there is a causal, economically\nmotivated reason that default occurs. Default is highly likely to occur when the market value of the firm\n(the sum of the value of its market capitalization and debt) is insufficient to cover its liabilities due at some\nfuture date – i.e. firms tend to default when they are insolvent. This follows from the fact that equity\nholders are residual claimants on the value of the firm. If the market value of the firm is negative,\nshareholders, who have limited legal liability, will simply walk away from the company, leaving the debt\nholders to recovery whatever they can from whatever remains of the firm value.\nThe above economic intuition can be translated into three quantifiable variables: the value of a firm’s assets\n(A), the volatility of its assets (denoted by σ), and its default point, X, which is determined by a firm’s\nliabilities. The interaction of the three variables is encapsulated by the firm’s distance-to-default (DD)\nwhich, under some largely innocuous assumptions, can be expressed as:\nln(A)−ln(X)\nDD≈\nσ\nThis simple equation essentially states that a firm’s relative credit risk (measured by DD) is a function of its\nfinancial risk and its business risk, two factors that are core concepts of fundamental credit analysis. The\nnumerator of the above equation measures market leverage – i.e. financial risk. All else equal, higher\nleverage decreases DD and hence increases the probability of default. The denominator of the DD equation\ncan be viewed as business risk. Firms in industries with high asset volatility tend to exhibit higher risk of\ndefault, all else equal. Once we have calculated a firm’s DD, we can derive its probability of default (its EDF\nmeasure) by looking at the historical average default rate consistent with each DD level.\nFacebook’s Default Probability Reflects Low Financial Risk…\nRelative to its USD 45 billion market capitalization, Facebook has almost no liabilities to speak of. Its 10-Q\nreleased June 2012 listed approximately USD 1 billion of short-term liabilities (partners payable, accrued\nexpenses, deferred revenue, etc.) and USD 585 million of long-term liabilities (the majority associated with\ncapital lease obligations). Figure 4 shows Facebook’s short-term, long-term, adjusted total adjusted\nliabilities, and its default point (the variable X in the DD equation above). For a corporate like Facebook, the\ndefault point is calculated as all short-term liabilities plus half of long-term liabilities – about USD 1.3 billion\nas of October.3 The graph shows that Facebook’s default point has been very steady since its May IPO. Total\nadjusted liabilities have risen slightly by 2% from its August 2012 level of USD 1.5 billion to its current level\nof USD 1.6 billion.\nTotal liabilities are calculated and reported using book values. This makes sense as most debt is not marked\nto market and must be repaid at face value. However, the public EDF model measures leverage on a market\nvalued basis. The asset value A in the DD equation above represents more than simply the market\ncapitalization of a firm plus the book value of its debt. It is essentially the enterprise or going-concern value\nof a company, which includes intangibles such as brand value. This is the quantity relevant for measuring\ndefault risk, because if the going concern value of a firm falls below its default point, it is essentially (if not\nactually) insolvent.\n3 The calibration of the default point for corporates was based on large data sample over many years. Setting the default point equal to short-term\nplus half of long-term liabilities yielded predicted default probabilities that were most consistent with observed default rates. More elaborate\ncalculations did not any better. Intuitively, as a firm enters financial distress some portion of long-term liabilities becomes more immediately due (for\nexample, some long-term debt may accelerate).\n4 7 NOVEMBER 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nFigure 4: Facebook’s Default Point, Short-Term, Long-Term, and Total Adjusted Liabilities\nFigure 5 shows the evolution of Facebook’s market leverage since June. Market leverage is the numerator of\nthe DD equation, so it includes both the changes in the default point (calculated using book liabilities) as\nwell as changes in the value of the firm that are reflected in its market capitalization. Facebook’s market\nleverage has fluctuated over a relatively wide range, from 1.49% to 2.53%. Since June, Facebook’s market\nleverage has increased by nearly 60%. The rise in its market leverage has been almost entirely driven by the\ndecline in its market value of assets. Since its IPO, Facebook’s market value of assets has fallen by 25% to its\ncurrent level of USD 52.3 billion. Despite the sharp increase, Facebook’s market leverage remains very low in\nboth absolute and relative terms. Compared to all corporate firms in North America, its current (as of 6\nNovember) 2.53% market leverage is in the fifth percentile.\nFigure 5: Facebook’s Market Leverage and EDF Metric\n…and High, but Relatively Favorable, Business Risk\nA firm’s asset volatility is a measure of its business or operating risk. Companies whose cash flows are highly\nvariable or that operate in sectors that are very competitive tend to exhibit higher business risk relative to\nthose that are more stable. The volatility of a company’s underlying business has a direct consequence for a\nfirm’s asset valuation: it will also show a relatively high level of volatility. As we can infer from Figure 5\nabove, Facebook is a prime example of a firm operating in a highly competitive industry sector with variable\nunderlying operating characteristics.\n5 7 NOVEMBER 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nPractically, business risk is measured as the standard deviation of the annualized change in the market value\nof a firm’s assets. Figure 6 shows the time series of Facebook’s estimated asset volatility against its EDF\nmeasure. Like we saw in the graph for market leverage, Facebook’s asset volatility has risen sharply since its\nMay IPO, and with no impact on the level of its expected default probability. Since May, its asset volatility\nhas increased by 33% to its current 25.37%. What accounts for the sharp rise in Facebook’s measure of\nbusiness risk?\nAdvertising is Facebook’s largest source of revenue. Of Facebook’s USD 1.26 billion third quarter revenues,\nabout 86% was derived from advertising. Analysts and investors have questioned whether the Facebook’s\nbusiness model can successfully adapt to the technological shift toward mobile devices, such as tablets and\nsmartphones, which are less suited to exposing users to advertisements. Approximately 60% of Facebook’s\nmembers now access its services using a mobile device compared to about 47% a year ago. This growing\nuncertainty about its business risk, particularly in light of the disappointing performance of its shares, is\nreflected in the time series of Facebook’s asset volatility shown in Figure 6. However, the third quarter\nresults released on 24 October (and not reflected in the data shown in Figure 64) helped allay some of these\nfears. Advertising revenues from mobile devices increased from USD 10 million in the second quarter to\nUSD 150 million in the third quarter. These results beat analysts’ expectations and suggested that Facebook\nwas indeed beginning to successfully adapt its business model.\nFigure 6: Facebook’s Asset Volatility, Instantaneous Equity Volatility, and EDF Measure\nOne of the unique features and strengths of Moody’s Analytics’ EDF model is its ability to calculate default\nprobabilities for firms that do not have traded bonds or CDS, and that may have very short histories. This is\noften a challenge for securities analysts trying to either value or gauge the risk of new firms. Within the EDF\nmodel, one of the key variables one needs to estimate is the firm’s asset volatility. We do this by combining\na modeled volatility component and an empirical volatility component to calculate total volatility for each\nfirm (as shown in Figure 6). Modeled volatility is the output of a regression model that uses a firm’s\ngeography, industry sector, size, and other firm-specific financial variables to estimate volatilities for\nhomogeneous sets of firms. So for a company like Facebook, we can estimate its modeled volatility based\non the characteristics that it is an internet company based in the US, with total revenue of USD 1.26 billion,\netc. Empirical volatility is calculated from the actual history of a firm’s equity returns.\nIn the EDF model, then, asset volatility is calculated as\nσ= θσ + (1- θ)σ\nM E\n4 Asset volatility is estimated monthly.\n6 7 NOVEMBER 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nIn other words, (total) asset volatility is a weighted average of modeled volatility and empirical volatility\n(where the θ are weights that sum to 100%). For a new firm such as Facebook, modeled volatility receives\nmost if not all weight. As firms accumulate more and more history, progressively greater weight is placed on\nthe empirical volatility component, so that asset volatility for a mature company with a long history is\nprimarily determined by its equity return history. This technique not only allows us to estimate default\nprobabilities for a larger set of companies, but it also increases the predictive power of the EDF model.\nTesting the Robustness of Facebook’s Default Probability\nThe cause-effect relationship between the EDF model’s drivers and the default probabilities generated by the\nmodel allows us to test the robustness of Facebook’s credit quality. In addition to estimating the level of a\nfirm’s default probability, we are also interested in how sensitive its EDF measure is to changes in the\nunderlying risk factors. In this section we perform a sensitivity analysis in which we measure the effect of\nchanging Facebook’s EDF drivers – share price (which affects the estimate of its market value of assets),\ndefault point, and asset volatility – on its EDF implied rating. We make no assumptions about what the\n“optimal” implied rating level for Facebook should be. Instead, we find the minimal values for each of\nFacebook’s EDF drivers that would allow it to retain its current Aaa EDF-implied rating. Because a\ncompany’s EDF drivers evolve interdependently, we perform marginal sensitivity tests – that is, we change\none driver while holding the others fixed at their current levels.5\nPerforming a sensitivity test serves at least three purposes. First, it tests how sensitive Facebook’s credit\nquality is to strategic errors that might result in a lower future share price and/or higher asset volatility.\nSecond, as we discussed in the section above, Facebook’s asset volatility is currently based on modeled\nvolatility. We can measure the robustness of Facebook’s EDF level to any potential mis-estimation of its\nasset volatility by varying its value. And last, we can test Facebook’s financing capacity – i.e. how much it\ncan lever up without substantially affecting its default risk.\nFigure 7: Effects of Changing Facebook’s EDF Drivers\nEDF Driver Current Value Hypothetical Value EDF Level EDF Implied Rating\nShare Price USD 21.18 USD 8.00 0.03% Aaa\nAsset Volatility 25.37% 33% 0.03% Aaa\nLong-Term Debt (Millions) USD 394 USD 3,800 0.03% Aaa\nThe sensitivity analysis results, presented in Figure 7, show that Facebook’s Aaa EDF implied rating is robust\nto some very large changes in each its drivers. Facebook’s share price could fall as low as USD 8, a 61%\ndecline from its current level, without affecting its Aaa implied rating (again, holding the other variables\nfixed at their current values). The lowest reported equity analysts’ estimate for Facebook’s shares is USD 15,\nso even in the worst case assessment of equity analysts Facebook’s implied ratings appears solid. Its asset\nvolatility could rise from its current 25.37% to 33% – a 30% increase – without denting its implied rating.\nThe last line of the table in Figure 7 shows that Facebook could issue approximately USD 3.4 billion of\nadditional long-term debt without losing its Aaa EDF implied rating. If Facebook were to raise these funds in\nthe capital markets, it would be a relatively large new corporate bond issue, larger than any US non-financial\nbond issue in 2012. It would increase Facebook’s debt-to-equity ratio6 from 2.96% to 28.5%.\nIt is also interesting to consider what effect such an increase in leverage might have on Facebook’s shares.\nThe expected rate of return on equity increases as a firm’s debt-to-equity ratio increases.7 Facebook’s equity\n5 We performed these calculations use the solver function on CreditEdge Plus.\n6 Calculation based on shareholders’ equity reported in Facebook’s June 2012 10-Q divided by long-term debt as reported in Figure 7.\n7 In a world where interest expense does not receive favorable tax treatment share price will not change (according to the Modigliani-Miller theorem).\nIn reality, shareholders benefit from increased leverage to the extent that the benefits of debt interest deductibility outweigh the expected cost of an\nincrease in default risk.\n7 7 NOVEMBER 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nreturns might stand to benefit from increasing leverage as long as the increase in gearing does not materially\nincrease its credit risk. The results of the sensitivity analysis shown in Figure 7 suggest that the possibility\nexists, considering the fact that the median yield on Aaa-rated debt (as of October) is just 1.7%.8 This is,\nultimately, a question about whether Facebook has an optimal mix of debt and equity in its capital structure\n– a difficult question to answer and one clearly beyond the scope of this case study. But given the sharp fall\nin Facebook’s shares since its IPO, and the fact that it has no debt, it is a natural question to contemplate.\nSummary\nAlthough the performance of Facebook’s shares has received enormous attention from investors and the\nfinancial media, its credit quality has received no notice. This is due to the fact that it is an unrated\ncompany and has no public bonds or credit default swaps from which to infer its credit risk. Moody’s\nAnalytics’ public Expected Default Frequency (EDF) model, which uses balance sheet information and equity\nmarket data, provides a unique tool to assess the credit risk of the company. Facebook exhibits very strong\ncredit quality, with a one-year EDF measure of 0.01% (1 bp) as of 6 November. That EDF level translates to a\nAaa implied rating on Moody’s rating scale. Its EDF measure has been unaffected by the approximately 40%\ndecline in its share price since its May IPO.\nAnalytically, the EDF model considers the same factors important to fundamental analysis of credit risk:\nbusiness, or operating, risk, and financial risk (leverage). Facebook’s 1 bp probability of default is supported\nby low financial risk and high, but relatively favorable business risk. Its market leverage (financial risk) is just\n2.53%, while its asset volatility (business risk), currently at 25.37%, is in the 25th percentile of its industry\nsector. Its EDF measure is also very robust to some relatively large potential changes in the drivers of its\ndefault probability. Facebook’s EDF level and implied rating is also robust to a 61% decrease in its share\nprice and an 30% increase in its asset volatility. Facebook could issue up to USD 3.4 billion of long-term\ndebt without affecting its Aaa EDF-implied rating.\n8 Source: Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.\n8 7 NOVEMBER 2012 CAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH GROUP / EDF CASE STUDY / MOODYS.COMCAPITAL MARKETS RESEARCH\nReport Number: 146733\nAuthor Contact Us\nDavid T.
