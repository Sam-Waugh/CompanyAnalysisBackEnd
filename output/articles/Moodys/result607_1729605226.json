A\nsimplified approach known as the PAA for contracts that fulfills certain criteria is optional and similar to the current Unearned\nPremium Reserve (UPR) approach.\nThe PAA can be used for insurance contracts with a coverage period of 12 months or less, or where the PAA and BBA do not\nmaterially produce different results. This may be the case for many general insurance contracts but is a question for multi-year\ncontracts and risk attaching reinsurance, and remains a challenge for business acquired through acquisition or portfolio transfer.\nThe second component, the LIC, related to past coverage is measured similarly under both approaches. It corresponds to\ncomponents such as Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) and Incurred But Not Enough Reported (IBNER) reserves, and outstanding\nreported case reserves for expired risk under the current reserving approach.\nOn a higher level, the requirements appear feasible and consistent with current practice. For example, LIC is already calculated for\nmany insurers, particularly P&C insurers, and it is an important item in managing profitability.\nHowever, challenges arise when looking into the details of IFRS 17 requirements. The granularity of the calculations, including\ndiscounting for the disclosure, is not the same as the current practice. Therefore, it becomes more difficult.\nFor the LRC under the PAA, some elements under IFRS 17 such as the unearned premium reserve, premium receivable, and\ndeferred acquisition costs asset will be estimated similar to current practice. However, combined into one element and in practice,\nnew calculations may require significant effort.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS UNPACKING LRC AND LIC CALCULATIONS FOR P&C INSURERS 2Liabilities for incurred claims (LIC)\nFigure 2 LIC calculation – data inputs\nIn the LIC calculation (Figure 2), the present value of future expected claims and expenses, and the risk adjustment are the two\ncomponents.\nFor the present value of cash flows (the best estimate liability (BEL)), we consider only the expected claim payments. If claims will\nnot be paid within 12 months from the incurred date, those cash flows need to be discounted, which is different from current\nreserving processes.\nThe expected stream of future cash flows that insurers must include in the LIC calculation is a new requirement. Insurers may not\nhave this available as an output of current reserving processes. Moody’s Analytics has worked with clients to enable them to\nproduce the stream of cash flows using their current resulting output (that is, the total outstanding claims reserve). We use the\ninsurer’s claim payment patterns to generate the stream of cash flows by IFRS 17 group.\nAlthough the process may seem straightforward, it gets complicated if insurers have different cash flows that may or may not be\nrelated to each other, or if they have to allow for events not in the data. Also, maintaining the link between direct insurance and\nreinsurance may be a challenge.\nRoll-forward of LIC\nFigure 3 LIC calculation – granularity of analysis\nLIC roll-forward is driven by the IFRS 17 reporting and disclosure requirements. Insurers have to produce reconciliation of the\nopening and closing balances by isolating specific items for reporting.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS UNPACKING LRC AND LIC CALCULATIONS FOR P&C INSURERS 3Figure 3 shows the requirements in terms of reporting in the bottom row. Looking at the actual roll-forward, we see the middle\nrow showing the steps in the calculation that insurers need to isolate. The top row is an example of the inputs required to produce\nthese results.\nThe standard requires insurers to split the insurance result from the finance result. This means that items related to discounting\n(time value of money) and any changes must be isolated in this roll-forward. These are reported in separate parts of the insurer’s\nP&L. The interest accretion, the unwinding of insurers’ discount rates, or any changes in financial assumptions are the elements\nreported as the net finance expense from insurance contracts.\nAnother requirement under IFRS 17 is a split between current and past service. Past service relates to the changes in estimates of\nclaims that are incurred in previous reporting periods. An example would be a change in what is known as the Incurred But Not\nReported (IBNR) for previous years, together with any variation between what insurers were expecting to pay for previous years’\nincurred claims and what was paid. Those variations will go into the P&L as past service.\nInsurers need the capability to do some of these calculations. This is necessary to capture the impact from a change in the\nprevious and current assumptions, such as a change in the discount rate.\nThe granularity of the analysis required is complex and requires new data. The calculations are subject to audit because they\nrepresent items in an insurer’s P&L. Insurers need a robust system that can manage the data and calculations, and store them in an\nauditable system.\nThe granularity of calculation for LIC\nFigure 4 LIC calculation – granularity of calculation\nFor the level of granularity at which calculations need to be performed (Figure 4), there are two aspects to consider. First is the\nunit of account (UoA). The standard unit of account under IFRS 17 is the group contracts.\nThe second aspect relates to the level at which insurance contract assets and liabilities are reported. Before the amendments to\nIFRS 17 were published in June 2020, insurers had to perform their LIC calculation at the group contract level to identify whether a\ngroup of contracts was an asset or liability. With the amendments, the International Accounting Standards Board (the Board) has\nchanged the requirement; insurers can now report assets and liabilities at the portfolio level.\nHowever, some requirements may still need calculations on the group contract level—for example, if insurers decide to\ndisaggregate insurance finance expense between the P&L and OCI. The expense is based on the rate locked in at inception, which\nis determined at the IFRS 17 group level. Hence, insurers must do the calculations at that level.\nThese issues drive the need for a robust system to perform calculations and store the results at the group contract level to report\non these results.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS UNPACKING LRC AND LIC CALCULATIONS FOR P&C INSURERS 4LRC calculations under PAA, and the underlying challenges\nThe calculation method for LRC will depend on the model that has been used; for P&C insurers, it will be either PAA or GMM. The\nGMM is complex because it contains multiple building blocks with interaction between those elements. The movements of each\nelement must be analyzed in each reporting period and for each group of contracts. For short duration contracts, this extensive\nanalysis would not deliver much value as the movements would not be as significant. This is why the Board introduced the PAA\napproach, which is simpler. Under this approach, there is no need to separate the components of the LRC.\nMeasurement of the LRC under the PAA is not very different from the current measurements model for short-term liabilities in\nmany jurisdictions.\nFigure 5 LRC computation under PAA\nThe middle row of Figure 5 shows the roll-forward of the LRC under the PAA. Note, there is no separate calculation for earned\npremium reserve and for premium receivable under PAA. All the calculations are based on the premiums received, less the\nexpected premiums to be received allocated to the period.\nThe PAA does not have an explicit deferred acquisition cost element. Insurers will report the acquisition costs that are already paid,\nless the amortized portion of those expenses. This results in a significant challenge created by the timing of the premium received,\nand whether it is based on an installment or if it is correlated.\nPremium variance treatment\nOne other area of complexity under the PAA is the premium variance treatment, which involves the treatment of the premium\nexperience adjustment. Deciding whether premium experience adjustments relate to current, past, or future service may be\ndifficult and require judgment. A situation may occur in which insurers will have a mixture of adjustments to current or past and to\nfuture years.\nThe IFRS 17 Transition Resource Group (TRG) offered some guidance in 2019 and concluded that the premium experience relating\nto current or past service should be recognized immediately in the P&L as part of the insurance revenue. In addition, the TRG\nprovided some examples to illustrate it. However, the examples do not reflect all the scenarios, and some questions remain.\nFor the TRG examples, the insurer did not know at the start of the period about the future premium adjustment and did not\ninclude it in the calculation of future revenue. However, in real life insurers might have a good prediction of what the future\npremium adjustment will be. Hence, the problem arises when deciding if this additional premium paid later is indeed a new\npremium adjustment, or known expected future cash flows that should be included in the calculation from inception.\nThere may also be a situation in which the insurer expects future premium adjustments not at the end of the period, but later. In\nsuch a situation, the assumptions must be monitored and updated at the end of the reporting period. If there was a situation\nwhere the future premium adjustment was not paid as expected, then the revenue already recognized in the previous period would\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS UNPACKING LRC AND LIC CALCULATIONS FOR P&C INSURERS 5result in losses in subsequent periods. Here lies the complexity, with the increased need for continuous tracking of the\nassumptions and the number of necessary adjustments.\nIn another scenario, there may be a delay of the premium payment at the end of the year, such as a premium that is due on\nDecember 30 but is paid on January 2. The standard approach to recognize a premium adjustment at the end of the year would\nresult in writing off an expected revenue from a contract at the end of the period—even though the premium was delayed only by\na few days. This creates unnecessary volatility between periods and does not portray the real nature of the transaction.\nFinally, there are also questions if the premium dissipates in a subsequent period after coverage ends. How would it be treated on\nthe balance sheet of that year? Do insurers still have LRC even though the coverage expired, and they are not providing any further\ncoverage, or is it some other sort of receivable?\nThus, there are several issues and varying interpretations to remember when designing a reporting solution so the system can offer\nvarious options to address significant issues.\nAcquisition expenses\nAnother amendment issued by the Board relates to acquisition expenses. Although it is helpful for many insurers, it also adds more\ncomplexity.\nBefore the amendment, insurers were required to allocate all initial acquisition expenses to contracts already written. This could\nresult in recognizing significant losses on initial contracts. It would not be consistent with economic substance, under which some\nof those acquisition costs borne upfront existed because insurers expect renewals of the contracts in the future periods.\nThe amendment brings the process closer to the current practice. It requires insurers to allocate the directly attributable\nacquisition cash flows in a systematic and rational way between the current and future renewal groups. Expenses related to future\ncontracts will be kept as an asset until the contracts are written. This amendment should make profit recognition more stable.\nHowever, insurers should be aware of the complexity created by this amendment. For example:\n» The Board did not prescribe what methods to use for systematic and rational allocation. Thus, insurers must develop their\nown methods and exercise judgment when they analyze which cash flows relate to expected future renewals. These allocation\nmethods may need to be revised and updated at the end of each reporting period if the expectations about the number of the\nrenewals change.\n» Another element to look at is impairment. The test is not required at every period, but only when facts and circumstances\nsuggest there is a need for it. The test itself is complicated and consists of two different steps. Similar to systematic rational\nallocations, insurers need to develop policies regarding impairment. More work might be required when performing those\nsteps at the end of every period.\n» The granularity of calculations will be different compared to the current practice. The calculations that relate to future cash\nflows and to the impairment will be required on a group contract level. Identifying future groups of contracts may be a\ncomplex task that depends on judgement.\n» New disclosures will be required because of this amendment. One of them will be a reconciliation from opening to closing\nbalances of the assets.\n» The asset for acquisition cash flows will be shown as part of the current amount for the related portfolio and not as a separate\nasset. This is another difference to insurers’ current practices.\nOne of the ways to avoid the complexity under the acquisition costs amendment would be to expense acquisition costs\nimmediately. However, by doing so companies would lose all the benefits of this amendment. To take advantage, insurers must be\naware and address all of these complexities.\nConclusion\nThere are multiple scenarios under which changes required to current models, data, and reporting might be more than trivial. To\ncomply with the new requirements, insurers should assess their current calculation engines’ capacity, and plan ahead for the\nnecessary updates.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS UNPACKING LRC AND LIC CALCULATIONS FOR P&C INSURERS 6© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
