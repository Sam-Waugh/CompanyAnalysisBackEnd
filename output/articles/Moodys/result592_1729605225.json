Biden’s American Jobs Plan\nincluded more than $900 billion in more spending on these types of traditional infrastructure, and then an additional $1.7 trillion in other spending and tax credits.\nMuch of this other proposed funding was for less traditional infrastructure such as housing, research and development, and manufacturing supply chains.\n3 In a full-employment economy, the GDP multiplier on traditional infrastructure is estimated to be 1.23 one year after the investment, and 1.12 for nontraditional infra-\nstructure. It is higher when the economy is operating below full employment.\n4 This differs from the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate that the average rate of return on private-sector investment is about 10% and that the average return on\nfederal investment is about half that. The difference is largely because the CBO assumes that a significant part of the increased federal spending on infrastructure will\nbe offset by less infrastructure spending by state and local governments. We do not expect this offset to be nearly as large with this infrastructure deal.\n5 A more detailed description of the programs and tax changes in the reconciliation package is available on request.\n6 For more information on the labor force participation rate impacts, a literature review is available in L.
