Returns to CLO investors are highly\ndependent on the credit risk of the underlying CLO portfolios and defaulted securities may be an important indicator of portfolio credit\nrisk. In this paper, we analyze CLO default percentages under a broader definition of default to try to identify additional portfolio\nsecurities worth a closer look. Rather than just look at whether a particular issue is identified as defaulted by a CLO (“Identified Default”\nor “ID”), we also measured the current percentage of collateral that is in default by assuming if any obligation of an issuer is indicated as\ndefaulted1 in any CLO, then all obligations of that issuer are tagged Suspected Default (“SD”). The deal SD percentage is then tabulated.\nSDs could occur when collateral is considered defaulted by one CLO and not another as a result of varying default definitions in their\nrespective CLO indentures. Alternatively, certain loan characteristics may allow some obligations of an issuer to be in default while others\nare not. It is important to note that all defaults are not alike. Particularly with leveraged loans which are senior secured obligations,\nbeing in default may not affect the timeliness of interest and principal payments. Some defaulted leveraged loans trade close to par.\nTables 1 & 2 show examples of collateral that is labeled SD and which ones are also in default in 2 different existing CLO’s. For example,\nEdmentum Inc in CLO 1 is classified as SD since at least 1 other CLO has classified an obligation of the same issuer as defaulted yet CLO\nhas not classified it as a default. The same could be said for US Foods in CLO 2.\nTable 1: CLO 1 - SD Collateral\nSuspected Default Defaulted\nSabine Oil & Gas LLC - Second Lien Term Loan Yes\nAllied Security Holdings LLC - First Lien Closing Date Term Loan No\nCaesars Entertainment Resort Properties LLC - First Lien Term B Loan No\nFCA US LLC - Senior Secured Tranche B Term Loan No\nGates Global LLC - Initial Dollar Term Loan No\nSoutheast PowerGen LLC - Term B Loan No\nTexas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC - DIP Term Loan No\nUS Foods Inc - Incremental Term Loan No\nTable 2: CLO 2 - SD Collateral\nSuspected Default Defaulted\nEducation Management II LLC Tranche A Term Loan Yes\nEducation Management II LLC Tranche B Term Loan - PIK Yes\nEducation Management II LLC Tranche B Term Loan Non-PIK Yes\nAffinion Group Initial Second Lien Term Loan No\nAffinion Group Tranche B Term Loan No\nAllied Security Holdings LLC First Lien Closing Date Term Loan No\nCaesars Entertainment Resort Properties LLC First Lien Term B Loan No\nEdmentum Inc First Lien Term Loan No\nFCA US LLC Senior Secured Tranche B Term Loan No\nFCA US LLC Tranche B Term Loan No\nTexas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC DIP Term Loan No\n1 At least 500,000 of principal in the obligation’s currency must be in default for all obligations of that Issuer to be considered SD.\n2 19 june 2015 collateral defaults vs. issuer defaultsSTRUCTURED ANALYTICS & VALUATIONS\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nUS BSL CLO Market\nThe analysis of SD collateral as compared to ID collateral was done by vintage and currency. We have first focused on the US dollar\nmarket and the vintages with the greatest issuance. (Appendix I gives a breakdown of the CLO’s analyzed per vintage & currency.).\nTable 3: US ID vs SD by Vintage\nIndicated Defaults (\"ID\") Suspected Defaults (\"SD\") Difference Between ID & SD Defaults\nVintage Average Max Min Average Max Min Average Max Min\n2005 30.17% 100.00% 0.00% 40.12% 100.00% 0.00% 9.95% 97.48% 0.00%\n2006 5.58% 100.00% 0.00% 9.30% 100.00% 0.00% 3.71% 100.00% 0.00%\n2007 2.11% 100.00% 0.00% 4.02% 100.00% 0.00% 1.91% 8.72% 0.00%\n2011 0.41% 3.81% 0.00% 1.99% 7.17% 0.00% 1.58% 3.61% 0.00%\n2012 0.29% 6.36% 0.00% 1.61% 10.03% 0.00% 1.32% 5.87% 0.00%\n2013 0.23% 8.90% 0.00% 1.37% 10.38% 0.00% 1.14% 4.82% 0.00%\n2014 0.07% 1.00% 0.00% 1.23% 4.24% 0.00% 1.16% 4.24% 0.00%\nGrand Total 2.30% 100.00% 0.00% 4.28% 100.00% 0.00% 1.97% 100.00% 0.00%\nAs you can see from the table, there are larger differences between SD and ID levels, the older the CLO vintage. This observation is not\nunusual given that performing collateral tends to get redeemed, matures or is sold by the late stages of a CLO’s life cycle. The average\nID level for the 2005 vintage is over 30% and over 40% when you measure SD’s. However, there is a very limited amount of CLO’s\nremaining from the 2005 vintage and much of that is likely a result of adverse selection bias. There are even some 2005-2007 CLO’s\nwhere all of the remaining collateral is ID. Conversely, 75% of the 2007 Vintage (US & Euro CLO’s) have a ID level of 3.1% or less despite\nthe interim recession.\nLet’s focus on the CLO 2.0 deals (Vintage 2011-2014). The average ID balance is very small with a range of 0.07% to 0.4%. The SD’s\nare between 1.23% and 1.99% with the largest CLO’s having over 10%. These higher numbers may not result in higher losses, but CLO\ninvestors and collateral managers may want to undertake further analysis of those issuers to determine if there is a potential problem\nwith the related collateral. If so, early action could enhance CLO investment performance. Chart 1 shows the difference of the Average\nSD vs ID levels by vintage. The difference declines significantly in the CLO 2.0 vintages.\nChart 1: Average Difference Between Defaulted and SD Percentage (USD)\n10%\n9%\n8%\n7%\n6%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0%\n2005 2006 2007 2011 2012 2013 2014\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\n3 19 june 2015 collateral defaults vs. issuer defaultsSTRUCTURED ANALYTICS & VALUATIONS\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nUp until this point we have focused on relatively wide differences between ID and SD balances. But what does it mean when the\ndifference between SD and ID levels is relatively narrow? For such CLOs, it is very possible that the narrow difference between SD and ID\ncould be indicative of a more restrictive definition of what is a “defaulted” security and thus could be an important indicator not just for\nassessing the current portfolio but also that future portfolios may be more conservatively reported. Alternatively, the collateral manager\nmay be focused on avoiding collateral where the obligation may not be in default, but the issuer’s other issues are defaulted. Further\nCLO/Manager review is likely warranted.\nCollateral managers (“Manager 1”) extensively analyze the assets of their CLO’s. Many, however, do not focus on the collateral of other\nCLO’s. The knowledge of collateral which other CLO’s list as ID, but are not ID in their portfolios may provide trading opportunities. On\nthe one hand, the “other CLO” may be more inclined to sell such collateral creating a buying opportunity if Manager 1 is bullish on the\nobligation. Conversely, if Manager 1 sees such obligations as ID in many CLO’s and that manager is also worried about it, Manager 1 may\nwant to sell the obligation early to “get ahead” of the potential selling by other CLO’s.\nEuropean CLO Market\nTable 4: European Defaults vs SD by Vintage\nIndicated Defaults (\"ID\") Suspected Defaults (\"SD\") Difference Between ID & SD Defaults\nVintage Average Max Min Average Max Min Average Max Min\n2005 4.07% 18.86% 0.00% 15.04% 39.99% 1.08% 10.97% 39.66% 1.05%\n2006 5.43% 99.98% 0.00% 11.07% 100.00% 0.00% 5.64% 15.48% 0.00%\n2007 2.91% 33.81% 0.00% 8.90% 71.70% 0.00% 5.99% 46.69% 0.00%\n2008 9.44% 99.99% 0.00% 11.47% 100.00% 0.00% 2.03% 7.51% 0.00%\n2013 0.09% 0.98% 0.00% 1.74% 4.30% 0.00% 1.65% 4.30% 0.00%\n2014 0.11% 2.69% 0.00% 1.62% 4.21% 0.00% 1.52% 4.21% 0.00%\nGrand Total 3.50% 99.99% 0.00% 8.40% 100.00% 0.00% 4.90% 46.69% 0.00%\nThe European vintages we have focused on are 2005-2008 & 2013-2014. Appendix I gives a breakdown of the number of CLO’s\nper vintage.\nAgain and as anticipated, the older deals tend to have the higher default percentages. As with the US CLO’s, there is a significant\ndifference between the indicated default holdings and that of the SD’s. Interestingly, the 2013-2014 vintages have almost no ID’s yet\nhave SD’s of 1.6% to 1.7%. Chart 2 depicts the difference between the average of each for the displayed vintages.\nChart 2: Average Difference Between Defaulted and SD Percentage (Euro)\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2013 2014\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\n4 19 june 2015 collateral defaults vs. issuer defaultsSTRUCTURED ANALYTICS & VALUATIONS\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nAs with the US CLO’s, the 2.0 CLO’s have the lowest differential. However, the 2008 vintage is also only has a moderate difference.\nConclusion\nOne purpose of the various tools developed by Moody’s Analytics is to add transparency to the CLO market. Many participants review\nthe defaulted collateral in a portfolio. In this paper, we introduce a measure of the current percentage of collateral that is “SD” i.e., if\nany obligation of any issuer in any CLO is in default, then all obligations of that issuer is SD. This metric could indicate collateral which\nmay warrant further analysis. By determining the level of impairment of such collateral (if any), analysts can further differentiate CLO\nperformance and potential investment or divestiture opportunities. Additionally, by knowing which collateral is ID in other CLO’s,\nopportunistic trading possibilities may arise for asset managers\n5 19 june 2015 collateral defaults vs. issuer defaultsSTRUCTURED ANALYTICS & VALUATIONS\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nAppendix I Outstanding CLO’s by Vintage & Currency in the Sample\n207\n200\nUS Euro\n160\n150\n125\n102 103\n100\n58\n49\n50\n26 25\n15 14 18 20\n0\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2011 2012 2013 2014\n6 19 june 2015 collateral defaults vs. issuer defaultsSTRUCTURED ANALYTICS & VALUATIONS\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n© 2015 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
