Introduction\nMoody’s investment in climate risk analysis is motivated by scientific consensus that global warming poses a major risk to the\nstability of the international financial system and the world economy. Already, we see that a 1oC global warming above pre-\nindustrial levels affects nearly every facet of the global economy—from infrastructure, agriculture, and real estate to human\nhealth and labor productivity.1 Although fossil-free energy use is on the rise, and many governments have introduced carbon\ntaxes and pledged to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the past decade was the warmest on record.2\nThe increasing pace of climate change and the increasing likelihood of major transition-related policy action have important\nimplications for the financial health of firms across the globe. Firms may suffer direct damages to their physical assets or\ndisruption to their business models due to weather and climate events. Carbon taxation, changing energy prices, and new green\ntechnologies confront corporations with risks as well as rewards. Financial institutions with exposure to these firms must\nunderstand and carefully measure climate-related risks during loan origination, monitoring, asset allocation, stress-testing, and\ndisclosure.\nTo quantify the corporate credit risks associated with climate change, Moody’s Analytics has developed a climate-adjusted\nversion of its Public Firm EDF (Expected Default Frequency) model. The Public Firm EDF model is a structural model of credit\nrisk that has been used by global banks, insurers, corporates, and asset managers for more than 30 years. During that time,\ncontinuous updates and validations have shown the model’s ability to accurately predict default events in diverse economic\nenvironments. The Public Firm EDF model provides a robust framework for understanding the effects of structural climate shocks\non corporate credit risk.\nTo augment the Public EDF framework to account for climate risk, Moody’s Analytics has developed a methodology to account\nfor the effect of climate on the underlying drivers of EDF metrics. The climate-adjusted model integrates climate scenarios\ndevised by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)3 and state-of-the-art data and assessment tools from the\nMoody’s MESG team to project the physical and transition risk metrics related to global warming and their impact on credit\nrisk.\nAdjusted EDF models allow the user to vary which damage functions are selected to calculate global physical damages in each\nscenario or to provide customized physical damage paths. Our Climate-Adjusted EDF models provide users with the following\nfunctionality:\n» 30‐year EDF term structures conditional on a climate scenario: For the 40,000 distinct names in the CreditEdge\nuniverse, the Climate-Adjusted EDF model produces a probability of default (PD) term structure that forecasts credit\nrisk over time for each climate scenario. We currently offer output based on the NGFS I & II scenarios, a consensus set\nof possible climate futures employed by many central banks and financial supervisors. We also produce scenarios by the\nMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n» Conditional valuation metrics: For each bond issuer in the CreditEdge universe, we leverage on the Moody’s EDF\nmodel and on the conditional PD term structures and adjust these to the physical and transition climate risks to produce\nthe climate-adjusted EDF term structure as well as a host of intermediate outputs, such as earnings, assets, and implied\nratings. The relevant output metrics are listed in Table 1.\n1 World Meteorological Organization (2020). Provisional report on the state of the Global Climate 2020.\n2 World Meteorological Organization (2015). 2020 was one of the three warmest years on record.\n3 Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is a group of 121 central banks and supervisors and 19 observers committed to sharing best practices,\ncontributing to the development of climate risk management in the financial sector, and mobilizing mainstream finance to support the transition towards a\nsustainable economy.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 3Table 1: Climate-Adjusted EDF Metrics\nMetric (NGFS I, II, MAS)\nFirm-level PD\nFirm-level Implied Rating\nFirm-level Cash Flow (Earnings)\nFirm-level Asset Value\nFirm-level Volatility\nFirm-level MESG Total Climate Score\nFirm-level Emissions Intensity relative to Sector Average\nFirm-level Energy Intensity relative to Sector Average\nFirm Market Share\nFirm Levelized Unit Costs\nFirm Price\nSector-level Production\nSector Total Revenue\nSector Total FCFF\nSector Average Price\nSector Average Levelized Unit Costs\nSector Total Quantity Sold\nSector Profit Margin\nSector x Region Cash Flow\nSector x Region Emissions Cost as % of Total Cost\nSector x Region Electricity Cost as % of Total Cost\nSector x Region Fuel Cost as % of Total Cost\n» Climate adjustment of user‐supplied PDs via the Climate PD Converter: The Climate-Adjusted EDF (CEDF) model\nis an attractive framework for understanding climate scenario-conditioned credit risk, even when baseline\n(unconditional) PDs are derived from a model other than the Public EDF model. The Climate PD Converter module\nallows users to input a baseline PD and key characteristics of a custom entity, such as asset value, sales, carbon footprint,\nand scope 1 and 2 emissions. The Converter in turn returns climate-adjusted term structures and associated credit\nmetrics for the name. The tool is useful for running unlisted and private names through the model, understanding\ngeneric sectoral and regional risks, and adjusting internal or reduced form PD models to account for climate risk.\nIn the following sections, we first summarize the key elements of the CEDF framework. Second, we describe the Global Change\nAnalysis Model (GCAM) which is used to generate climate scenarios. We then provide details regarding our physical risk\nmethodology where we leverage on firm-specific MESG physical scores to derive firm-level damages from a global damage\nfunction. Transition risk employs the sectoral output from GCAM combined with firm-level scope 1 and 2 emissions. These are\nused to adjust firm-level costs. Using these costs and a model of oligopolistic competition, we disaggregate sectoral output to\nthe firm level. The impact of the two risks is combined via the path of asset values. We generate a joint output and also illustrate\naggregated risks in a portfolio of corporate bonds. Finally, we show how customized inputs, such as emissions plus assets and\nsales from financials can be used to produce climate-adjusted EDFs for both private and public companies.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 42. Climate-Adjusted Expected Default Frequency Framework\nMoody’s Analytics CEDF models follow the established taxonomy of climate risk, which falls into two broad categories: physical\nrisk and transition risk—see Figure 1. The CEDF model final output is a term structure, the corporate probability of default, one\nof the credit risk metrics.\n» Physical risk encompasses the costs and risks arising from the physical effects of climate change on businesses’\noperations, workforce, markets, infrastructure, raw materials, and assets. Physical risks are further delineated as acute\n(e.g., extreme weather-driven events such as cyclones, hurricanes, or floods) or chronic (e.g., longer term climatic shifts\nthat may cause changes in temperature, precipitation, water stress, or sea level rise).\n» Transition risk encompasses the costs and risks associated with the transition to a lower carbon economy, and can\ninclude policy changes, such as carbon taxes or cap and trade, new regulations on goods and services, reputational\nimpacts, and shifts in market preferences, norms, and technologies.\nLevels of physical and transition risk can vary dramatically between firms. Firms with facilities in South East Asia, the Middle\nEast, and the Caribbean—areas with high exposures to warming-related climate and weather events—will have relatively high\nphysical risk. Firms in industrial sectors such as Coal, Oil & Gas, and Electricity Generation—which are highly exposed to carbon\ntransition—will have relatively high transition risk.\nCurrent best practice, influenced by both stress-testing conventions and climate science methods, is to discretize the continuous\ndistribution of possible economic and climate futures into several representative climate scenarios. Each scenario represents a\njoint path of economic growth, emissions, and warming over a long period of time (typically, to the year 2100). By analyzing\nthe effects of climate under these scenarios, practitioners can gain an understanding of the plausible physical and transitional\nimpacts that global warming may have on the risk profiles of their exposures.\nOnce a specific climate scenario is selected for analysis, we carry out several modeling steps to better understand the financial\nand credit effects of the future climate path in question. First, we model the relationship between raw climate risk drivers and\nthe economic environment at any point of time within a given climate scenario path. Next, we analyze how modeled economic\nenvironments affect each firm’s financial health within these environments. Finally, we translate each firm’s financial position\ninto credit risk forecasts at any point within the scenario. The impact is then aggregated at portfolio level.\nWe forecast the effects of physical and transition risk on the financial drivers of the Moody’s Public EDF model. The Public EDF\nmodel is employed to translate the firm’s financial position into its credit risk—-see Figure 2. It is a Merton-type structural model\nof credit risk. Structural credit risk models are defined by explicitly modeling the total firm asset value (enterprise value) process\nover time and by estimation of the likelihood of a firm’s asset value falling below a lower bound (the default point) within a\ncertain time horizon. If the firm asset value does in fact fall below this default point, the firm is considered insolvent, and it goes\ninto default. Therefore, the likelihood of the firm’s asset value falling below the default point is also the probability of default\ndenoted as the Public EDF (Expected Default Frequency) value. The Climate-Adjusted EDF methodology provides credit risk and\nvaluation metrics for all firms in the CreditEdge universe (i.e., nearly all global publicly traded firms, over 40,000 listed\ncompanies).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 5MOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 63. Climate Scenarios\n3.1 Attributes of Climate Scenarios\nRaw scenario assumptions are converted to a path of future emissions via a climate-focused economic model called an\nintegrated assessment model (IAM). IAMs explore the development of technological, socioeconomic and policy pathways based\non anthropogenic emissions defined by the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).4 The RCP scenarios refer to radiative\nforcing and include future trajectories of concentrations of greenhouse gasses and other air-pollutants in the atmosphere as\nwell as changes in the global land use/land cover. They are expressed at watts per square meter. The scenarios incorporate\nmultiple levels of anthropogenic emissions, including low (RCP1.9 and 2.6), intermediate (RCP4.5 and 6.0) and high pathways\n(RCP7.0 and 8.5). They are further associated with temperature projections up to 2100. Based on the severity of each scenario,\na likely range of temperatures is related to each RCP relative to the pre-industrial period. Global surface temperature change for\nthe end of the 21st century (2081–2100) is projected to exceed 1.5°C for RCP2.6 and is likely to reach temperatures above 2°C\nfor RCP4.5 and higher emission scenarios.5\nEmissions are mapped into global temperatures by use of the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate\nChange (MAGICC). Since the mapping of emissions to temperatures is associated with uncertainty, NGFS provides us with a\ndistribution of future temperature paths. We use the median (50th percentile) expected temperature path for two Orderly (Net\nZero 2050 and Below 2°C), two Disorderly (Divergent Net Zero and Delayed Transition), and two Hot House World (Nationally\nDetermined Contributions and Current Policies) scenarios. Future temperature paths are then mapped into future damage in\npercentage of global GDP paths via aggregated damage functions. There is a variety of research studies informing this mapping.\nIn our model, we make sure that the damage path we use for the analysis matches a consensus view of the research community.\nThe scenarios dependent on the carbon prices as defined by NGFS II narratives (NGFS II, 2021)6 can be described as follows:\n» Net Zero 2050: Assumes that ambitious climate policies are introduced immediately. Global warming is limited to 1.5°C\nthrough stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching global net zero CO2 emissions around 2050. Some\njurisdictions such as the US, EU, and Japan reach net zero for all GHGs.\n» Below 2°C: Assumes that climate policies are introduced immediately and become gradually more stringent though not\nas high as in Net Zero 2050. A 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C is given.\n» Divergent Net Zero: Assumes that climate policies are more stringent in the transportation and buildings sectors. Net\nzero is achieved around 2050 but with higher costs due to divergent policies introduced across sectors leading to a\nquicker phase out of oil use.\n» Delayed transition: Assumes new climate policies are not introduced until 2030 and annual emissions do not decrease\nuntil then. Strong policies are needed to limit warming to below 2°C. CO2 removal is limited.\n» Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs): Assumes that the moderate and heterogeneous climate ambition\nreflected in the conditional NDCs at the beginning of 2021 continues over the 21st century (low transition risks). Includes\nall pledged policies even if not yet implemented.\n» Current Policies: Assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks.\nFigure 3 shows the scenario-specific mapping from the carbon price to emissions by scenario. Emissions imply the corresponding\ntemperature pathway, which in turn determines the global damages, according to Kalkuhl & Wenz (2020).7\n4 Van Vuuren, D.P., Edmonds, J., Kainuma, M .et al.

Based on five narratives, the SSPs describe alternative socio-economic futures in the absence of\nclimate policy intervention, comprising sustainable development (SSP1), middle-of-the-road development (SSP2), regional\nrivalry (SSP3), inequality (SSP4), and fossil-fueled development (SSP5)—see Figure 5. The combination of SSP-based\nsocioeconomic scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-based climate projections provides an integrative\nframework for climate impact and policy analysis. All economic assumptions are taken from the shared socioeconomic pathway\n2 (SSP2), designed to represent a “middle-of-the-road” future development:\n» Social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns.\n» Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others\nfall short of expectations.\n» Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century.\n» Income inequality persists or improves only slowly.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 93.3 Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)\nIn assessing climate risk impact, we rely on GCAM that provides us with detailed sectoral and regional analysis. GCAM (see\nTechnical documentation NGFS Phase II)8 is a global model that captures interactions among the energy system, water system,\nagriculture and land use, the economy, and the climate (Figure 6).9 GCAM has the following features:\n» It consists of a data input framework and the GCAM core.\n» The GCAM data system reconciles a wide range of different data sets and systematically incorporates a range of\nassumptions.\n» GCAM generates a dataset with historical and base-year data for calibrating the model along with assumptions about\nfuture trajectories such as GDP, population, and technology.\n» The GCAM core models capture economic decisions (e.g., land use and technology choices) and their joint dynamics\nwith various human and Earth systems.\n» GCAM processes assumptions from the data system to create a complete scenario including future projections of prices;\nenergy and other transformations; and commodity and other flows across regions and into the future.\n» GCAM provides the greatest disaggregation spatial dimension, temporal dimension, as well as demand sectors and\nsubsector detail when compared with the other Integrated Assessment Models used by NGFS.\n» GCAM allows for the estimation of global and regional mitigation cost, for the analysis of emissions pathways, for the\nassociated land use and energy system transition characteristics, and for quantification of investment.\nFigure 7 presents the total amount of energy consumed in transportation industry for the 32 regions defined in GCAM under\nthe delayed transition scenario. International shipping and aviation, passenger and freight are included in this sector. All energy-\nrelated outputs in GCAM are reported in EJ/yr (exajoule/year). An EJ is equal to 1018 (one quintillion) joules. For example, the\n2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan had 1.41 EJ of energy according to its rating of 9.0 on the moment magnitude\nscale. Furthermore, the annual U.S. total energy consumption amounts to roughly 94 EJ. In Figure 7, China is presented to have\nthe largest energy consumption with a peak around 2050. Other large regional energy consumers, the US and selected European\n8 Bertram C., Hilaire J, Kriegler E, Beck T, Bresch D, Clarke L, Cui R, Edmonds J, Charles M, Zhao A, Kropf C, Sauer I, Lejeune Q, Pfleiderer P, Min J, Piontek F,\nRogelj J, Schleussner CF, Sferra, F, van Ruijven B, Yu S, Holland D, Liadze I, Hurst I (2021): NGFS climate scenario database: Technical documentation V2.2\n9 The current version of the model is documented at http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/v5.4/overview.html and in Calvin et al.

A GJ of natural gas is about 25.5 cubic metres at standard conditions, which is approximately\nequivalent to 27 litres of fuel oil, 39 litres of propane, 26 litres of gasoline or 277 kilowatt hours of electricity. The graph presents\nincreased prices of electricity and hydrogen-generated energy, median prices for oil and petroleum products (refined liquids)\nand stable low costs for gas and coal.\n10 EU-15 comprises the following countries: Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,\nMonaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, United Kingdom\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 114. Physical Risk\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed the equivalent of roughly 9% of the GDP of Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, and Alabama in\nthe United States. Under various climate scenarios, additional global annual physical damage is projected to be close to 3% of\nGDP by 2050. This is equivalent to a Hurricane of the size of Katrina every three years, everywhere in the world. The exposure\nto physical risk varies dramatically between regions. Analyzing the exposure of business facilities of a firm to physical risk is\ntherefore paramount for assessing the impact of physical climate risk on a firm’s financial health and its probability of default.\nIn this section, we present a five step methodology to capture physical risk within the Moody’s Public EDF model leveraging\nMoody’s ESG (MESG) climate scores. We find that accounting for physical climate risk can significantly drive up EDFs.\nOur five-step methodology concentrates on the impact of physical climate risk on a firm’s financial position and its probability\nof default. Physical climate risk enters the framework of Moody’s Analytics Public Firm EDF (Expected Default Frequency) model.\nPhysical climate-adjustment is carried out by adjusting the statistical moments describing the earnings, and thus, asset value\nprocess. We quantify the effect of physical risk on these firms’ moments within scenario analyses as follows:\n1. Global physical damages. In Section 3, we employ the outcomes of an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), a Global\nCirculation Model (MAGICC), and Aggregated Damage Functions (ADF) to obtain the expected global damages paths\nin percentage of GDP under various climate scenarios.\n2. Firm location-specific physical damages. Firms with facilities in areas with high exposures to warming-related climate\nand weather events will have relatively high physical risk-related damage. We leverage Moody’s ESG (MESG) country\nand firmlevel scores to determine how global damages are distributed across firm locations. We also leverage on the\nUN Sustainability Index Data and EM-DAT Database for data on natural disasters by country and the World Bank Data\nfor GDP.\n3. Firm-specific hazard frequency. We translate firm location damage (in % of GDP) in a hazard frequency. To do so, we\ncalculate the average damage ‘dose’ of significant climate events. We then compute the number of average dosed\nclimate events, which is equivalent to the associated damage of the firm location. More firm-level damage is\nrepresented by a higher frequency of average dosed climate hazard events.\n4. Firm impact per event in financial terms. We translate economic damages (% of GDP) into financial damages (change\nin asset value). For this, we leverage the results of a case study on historical public asset return of climate events\n(Ozkanoglu, 2020)11 to assess the impact on firms’ earnings and asset value upon realization of adverse climate hazard\nevents. As a result, we obtain the total expected impact on the statistical moments describing a firm’s asset value\nprocess.\n5. Effect on firm EDF drivers. We translate physical climate risk-related earnings shocks into climate-adjusted asset value\nprocesses, and therefore the associated EDFs.\nNext, we describe each of the five steps of our methodology in more detail.\n4.1 Firm Location-specific Physical Damages\nWe determine how a specific firm’s damage compares to the global average damage. Global average damage is measured in\npercent of global GDP. We construct measure of a firm’s damage (in percent of a firm’s GDP) and then use our MESG climate\nrisk scores to estimate the relationship between global average damage and a firm’s (facilities) damage. These scores reflect an\nassessment on the locations of a firm’s production facilities and physical assets. The application matches facility location data\nagainst climate model forecasts of relative geospatial exposure to different climate hazards in a warming world. The output is a\nrelative physical risk exposure score from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk). MESG physical risk climate scores comprise weighted\ninformation of three key sub-components: 1) Operations risk (70%), 2) Supply chain risk (15%), and 3) Market risk (15%), see\nFigure 9. The MESG score can be considered an ordinal score, ranking relative risk across different firms but not relating\nproportional risk between two firms based on the ratio of their scores.\n11 Ozkanoglu, O., K. Milonas, S. Zhao, and D. Brizhatyuk (2020). An Empirical Assessment of the Financial Impacts of Climate-related Hazard Events. Moody’s\nAnalytics White Paper.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 12Operations risk aggregates the overall risk exposure of a firm’s facilities with regard to specific hazards. Exposure is assessed at\nthe facility-level, which includes screening thousands of facilities. In total, the exposure is assessed to six different climate\nhazards: Floods, Sea Level Rise, Water Stress, Hurricanes & Typhoons, Heat Stress, and Wildfires. The scores account for the fact\nthat different facilities at the same location may be affected very differently by specific hazard events. The six hazards are\ncomplemented by a measure reflecting socioeconomic risk score, reflecting the commitment to ESG-related goals of the\ncountries in which the firm’s facilities are located. Figure 10 showcases the distribution of the Floods sub-score across the\nfacilities for Petroleo Brasileiro SA where the facilities’ exposure to Floods is ranked on a scale between 0 (low risk) and 100\n(high risk).\nMarket Risk depends on climate risk exposure of sales, and Weather Sensitivity measures the sensitivity of economic output to\nclimate variability for a given industry. Supply Chain Risk consists of two indicators. Countries of Origin measures the climate\nrisk in the countries that export the commodities a firm is dependent on for production and delivery of products and services.\nDemand for resources measures the industry-level dependence on climate-sensitive resources, such as water, land, and energy\nacross the supply chain.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 13As the data on damage in terms of a firm’s location GDP is not available, we establish the relationship between damages of\ncountry k (in % of country GDP) relative to global damage (in % of global GDP) leveraging on MESG country climate scores:\n(1)\nWe employ data derived from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Indicator Database, the EM-DAT\ninternational disaster database, and the World Bank to calculate economic damages associated with weather and climate on a\nyearly basis by country from 2000 to the present. GlobalDamaget is the observed average global level of yearly damages as\na percentage of world GDP.\nWe use estimated coefficients from Equation (1), and , and project firm-level specific paths for (in % of\nfirm GDP) of firm i in some future year t as: ∧ ∧\n𝛼𝛼 𝛽𝛽 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡\n(2)\nFuture (as a % of the firm’s GDP) is a stochastic function of expected global damage and the MESG firm\nscores.\n𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡\nFigure 11 illustrates the projected distribution of damages for Petroleo Brasileiro SA (MESG firm score of 79).

In several realizations, the event damage size will exceed the\nexpected damage by far. For instance, the largest event realization of the 50 simulations for the year 2040 is 9.44% (of firm\nGDP) – exceeding by far the expected global damage of 1.67%.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 144.2 Firm-specific Hazard Frequency\nWe have specified the distribution of possible economic damage levels (in % of firm GDP) associated with a firm as a function\nof its MESG firm climate score and the expected global economic damage level calculated for each future year under a climate\nscenario. Now we determine how total damage of a firm can be translated into a frequency of hazard events. Total damage (in\n% of firm GDP) of a firm i at a future point in time t is denoted FirmDamagei,t = . The total firm damage aggregates\ndamages from six main hazard types h, i.e. , = .

The final step\nto calibrating asset shocks is forecasting the financial impact upon realization of a climate hazard event. To achieve this, we\nagain turn to the event study estimates reported in Ozkanoglu, et al. (2020). An advantage of using the EDF model to understand\nclimate shocks is that because it has been in use for 30 years, we have estimated EDF asset returns for public firms over that\nentire time period. The event study looks at the asset returns for firms affected by large climate events over this period, and\ncompares those returns to asset returns of similar firms in the same time period not affected by climate events. The result is a\nmeasure of the negative excess asset returns associated with climate events, which we treat as the financial magnitude of asset\nshocks associated with the climate events.\nAsset shocks associated with climate events are assumed to follow a hazard-specific normal distribution, , where µh\ndescribes the mean and describes the variance of the normal distribution. In our methodology, we exploit 2the fact that\nmoment parameters chara2cterizing respective normal distribution depend on a firm’s baseline asset v𝑁𝑁o(la𝜇𝜇tℎ il,it𝜎𝜎yℎ ) not yet\nadjusted for physical\nclima𝜎𝜎tℎ\ne risk. We leverage the Moody’s Analytics event study research to identify the empirical relationships\nof µh := µh ( ) and := ( ), and hence N(µh( ), ( )).\n𝜎𝜎𝐵𝐵—\nFirst, we find\n𝜎𝜎\nt𝐵𝐵hat the\n𝜎𝜎\nhℎighe 𝜎𝜎rℎ th 𝜎𝜎e𝐵𝐵 baseline asset volat 𝜎𝜎il𝐵𝐵ity 𝜎𝜎ℎ, 𝜎𝜎t𝐵𝐵he larger the expected negative return µh after a hazard event. A\ntheoretical underpinning for this observation is that a low baseline asset volatility reflects a firm’s general resilience with regard\nto shocks. Arguably, firms that display a higher resilience𝜎𝜎 i𝐵𝐵 n general may also be expected to be more resilient with respect to\nclimate shocks. Second, we find that the higher the baseline asset volatility , the more uncertain the actual size of the impact\nof the hazard event on the asset value. For instance, if the baseline asset volatility is very low, the measured hazard induced\nasset shock size may be very accurate. For a larger baseline asset volatility𝜎𝜎 𝐵𝐵 the dispersion of measured hazard-induced asset\nshock may increase since several other factors may contribute to the variability in the asset value.\n4.4 Effect on Firm EDF Drivers\nWe proceed in several steps to introduce physical climate risk in the Moody’s Analytics’s Expected Default Frequencies (EDF)\nmodel. First, we briefly outline the baseline CreditEdge Public EDF model, which abstracts from physical climate risk. Second,\nwe show how the EDF term structure is modeled, and illustrate that taking into account physical climate risk amounts to\nadjusting the firm’s asset value process. Finally, we show how the adjustment of the asset value process is implemented.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 154.4.1 Public EDF Model (Current EDF)\nThe CreditEdge Public EDF model12 is a Merton-type structural model of credit risk. Structural credit risk models are defined by\nexplicit modelling of the total firm asset value (enterprise value) process over time and by estimation of the likelihood of a firm’s\nasset value falling below a lower bound (the default point) within a certain time horizon. If the firm asset value does in fact fall\nbelow this default point, the firm is considered insolvent, and goes into default. Figure 12 illustrates the asset value process of a\nfirm over a one-year period represented by 50 possible paths of the firm asset value. Using the structural model, we can calculate\nthe percentage of possible asset value paths that fall below the default point within a year. This percentage is the probability of\ndefault, labeled in CreditEdge as EDF.\nEDF depends on the asset value process with the following key parameters: baseline initial market asset value (VB), a default\npoint (DPB), and baseline asset volatility over the next year ( ). The default point of the firm is a function of the firm’s liability\nvalue. Higher leverage brings the firm closer to the default point. This property is reflected in the ratio . The baseline asset\n𝜎𝜎𝐵𝐵\n𝑉𝑉𝐵𝐵\nvolatility derived from both the firm’s historical asset volatility and other firm and market data. The distance-to-default metric\n𝐷𝐷𝑃𝑃𝐵𝐵\nin the Baseline scenario (DDB), i.e. abstracting from physical climate risk, is defined as follows:\n(3)\nwhere µ is the drift term for asset value. Using an empirically calibrated transfer function f(), the distance-to-default measure\ncan be translated into a baseline Expected Default Frequency, EDFB = f DDB .\n·\n( )\n4.4.2 Physical Risk Adjustment EDF Term Structure\nThe structural approach builds upon a one-year probability of default EDFB,t= . Our baseline EDF term-structure over T years\nis denoted EDFB,t t { , ..., T }. Our climate-free approach is taking into the\n1\nstage of the credit cycle, region, industry, and\nfirm-specific shocks. The main drivers are the asymptotic default tendency (ADT) that reflects the long-term default risk for a\nspecific firm, the agg∀reg∈ate1 factor (AF) that captures the systemic risk in the credit cycle (conditioned on region), and the firm-\nspecific factor (FF) that captures the firm’s credit risk when compared to the current credit cycle within the corresponding region.\n12 The Public EDF Model is a commercialized version of the KMV credit risk model. A description of the CreditEdge Public EDF model can be found in Chen,\nNan, Houman Dehghan, Min Ding, Jian Du, James Edwards, Danielle Ferry, Pooya Nazeran, Sue Zhang, Douglas Dwyer, and Jing Zhang (2015). EDF9:\nIntroduction Overview. Moody’s Analytics White Paper.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 16We illustrate the interaction between the AF and FF in Figure 13. In panel (a), the aggregate factor (AF) pushes the EDF below\nthe ADT. At the same time the firm-specific factor (FF) pushes the EDF above the ADT, see panel (b). As the impacts of both\nfactors fade away at different speeds, a hump-shaped baseline term structure arises, panel (c). From the baseline scenario, we\nhave EDFB,t { , ..., T } and the drivers of the baseline distance-to-default in t = 1, i.e. , and .\n𝑉𝑉𝐵𝐵,1\n∈ 1 𝐷𝐷𝑃𝑃𝐵𝐵,1 𝜎𝜎𝐵𝐵,1\nThe climate physical risk adjusted EDFs exploits the relationship EDFC,t = f(DDC,t).

The market asset value\nof a firm can be thought of as a firm’s ability to generate future cash flow. Hence, and as is standard practice, the market asset\nvalue of a firm can be described as 𝑉𝑉t𝐵𝐵 h, e𝑡𝑡 disco𝜎𝜎u𝐵𝐵 n,𝑡𝑡 ted sum of investors’ expectations, [], of fu𝑉𝑉t𝐶𝐶 u,𝑡𝑡 re cas𝜎𝜎h 𝐶𝐶 f, l𝑡𝑡 ows—see Equation (5).\n𝔼𝔼\n(5)\nThe physical climate-adjustment is carried out by adjusting the statistical moments describing the cash flow, and subsequently\nthe asset value process. In panel (a) of Figure 14, we highlight the impact of physical climate change on one realization of the\ncash flow path. The green line reflects cash flows without climate change, the orange line depicts cash flows after taking into\naccount physical climate risk. In panel (b), we show the impact of physical climate risk for the full sample of realizations of the\ncash flow process. Note that the climate-induced uncertain shocks affect both the expected value as well as the dispersion of\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 17cash flow paths. In panel (c), we plot the transmitted effect on the asset value process, reflecting the discount factor and\ninvestors’ expectations. Both the expected asset return as well as the dispersion of the asset value change. Compared to a\nsituation in which investors do not take into account physical climate risk, investors taking into account physical climate risk\nexpect that physical hazard events have an effect on the company’s future abilities to generate cash flows. Since the asset value\nis the sum of discounted expected future cash flows (see Equation (5), this causes a drop in the asset value today.\n4.5 Case Study: Petroleo Brasileiro SA\nPetroleo Brasileiro SA is relatively exposed to physical climate risk as expressed in the value of the MESG composite climate\nscore of 79 (see Table 2). The shape of the baseline EDF term structure in Figure 15 is a result of the baseline model abstracting\nfrom climate physical risk.\nTable 2: Overview: Petroleo Brasileiro SA\nConcept Description\nCompany Petroleo Brasileiro SA\nTicker PETR4\nPID W00637\nIndustry OIL OIL REFINING\nCountry Brazil\n1-year EDF 0.199 %\nImplied Rating Baa3\nAssets (million USD) 163,603.7\nClimate Score 79\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 18Figure 16 illustrates the impact of the physical risk on the EDF drivers and on the EDF. In the top-left panel, earnings are affected\ndifferently across climate scenarios. Generally, the larger the damages associated with a scenario, the lower the earnings. Since\nearnings (cash flows) are directly mapped into asset values, larger damages associated with a scenario imply lower asset values.\nNote that in addition to earnings, asset values are driven by the discount factor and the investors’ expectations. The change in\nasset values has a direct impact on the distance-to-default, and thus, EDF, as in the bottom-left panel. Introducing physical\nclimate risk generally leads the EDFs to increase. Finally, on the bottom right graph is displayed the difference between baseline\nforward EDF and climate-adjusted forward EDF (in percentage).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 195. Transition Risk\nAs with the physical risk methodology, our approach to measuring transition risk is to calculate its effects on the drivers of the\nPublic Firm EDF model. We explicitly model the fundamentals driving the asset value process of the firm over time. The\nfundamentals that give a firm value are the discounted cash flows expected to be accrued. By modeling transition-adjusted cash\nflows, we can use properly discounted future earnings expectations to model transition-adjusted asset value processes. These\nasset value processes, in turn, dictate the expected paths of the Public Firm EDF drivers—see Figure 17 for an illustration of the\nprocess.13\nIn contrast to the Moody’s Analytics physical risk-adjusted EDF methodology, the explicit forecasting of earnings requires an\nadditional level of modeling. The necessity of the extra step of modeling earnings is twofold. First, in case of physical risk, we\nhave access to the historical analog of the direct effect of past climate events on firm asset values, which can be used to calibrate\nthe effect of future physical damage on the asset process. No such clear historical analog exists to analyze future transition\nscenarios, so a more theoretically driven calibration method is necessary. Second, the economic effects of climate-driven\ntransition are complex due not only to their heterogeneous and often opposing effects on firms and sectors, but also due to the\nlong-time dimension over which the effects take place. To understand the consequences of transition on firm valuation requires\ncareful modeling of the earnings paths underlying firm asset values.\nTo understand how earnings are affected by transition, it is necessary to model a scenario’s effect on competitive equilibria both\nbetween the production of different good types and on firms producing the same good within each market. Figure 18 shows a\nmore detailed look at how we move in three steps from a transition scenario to earnings paths, the asset value process, and\nfinally transition risk-adjusted EDF metrics.\n13 Please note that the CEDF model produces the term structure of EDF and the Implied Rating. The Distance to Default DD is used only implicitly. It is also\npausible to derive Fair Value Spread but this is currently not an output of the CEDF model.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 20Step 1: Earnings projections on sectoral/regional level\nTo understand the effect of the scenario on earnings in each sector/region combination, we leverage on the Global Change\nAnalysis Model (GCAM) discussed previously. GCAM is distinctive among Integrated Assessment Models used by the NGFS to\ngenerate scenario pathways for its highly detailed modeling of regions and industrial sectors, providing prices, production\nquantities, and itemized costs for over a thousand interlinked production technologies. This data enables us to calculate sector-\nlevel earnings that account for scenario-conditioned supply and demand shocks arising from each transition future. Table 3 lists\nour aggregated GCAM Transition Sectors for reference.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 21Table 3: Sectors based on GCAM Classification\nSector Code Sector Name\nG01 General Industry\nG02 Fertilizer\nG03 Concrete\nG04 Nuclear Fuel Generation\nG05 Agriculture\nG06 Coal Extraction\nG07 Oil and Natural Gas Extraction\nG08 Urban Processes\nG09 Electricity Production - Gas\nG10 Electricity Production - Geothermal\nG11 Electricity Production - Hydro\nG12 Electricity Production - Nuclear\nG13 Electricity Production - Refined Liquids\nG14 Electricity Production - Solar\nG15 Electricity Production - Wind\nG16 Biomass Liquid Refining\nG17 Coal to Liquid Refining\nG18 Oil Refining\nG19 Natural Gas to Liquid Refining\nG20 Gas Processing\nG21 Delivered Gas\nG22 Delivered Biomass\nG23 Delivered Coal\nG24 Delivered Refined Liquids\nG25 Building Cooling\nG26 Building Heating\nG27 Construction (Other)\nG28 Ship\nG29 Freight Road\nG30 Car\nG31 Biomass\nG32 Coal\nG33 Delivered Electricity Building\nG34 Delivered Electricity Transportation\nG35 Delivered Electricity Industrial\nG36 Unconventional Oil\nG37 District Heat\nG38 Industrial Energy Use\nG39 Residential Construction\nG40 Flight\nG41 Freight Rail\nG42 Hydrogen Enduse\nG43 Industrial Processes\nG44 Bicycles/Motorcycles\nG45 Mass Passenger Transport\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 22Step 2: Earnings projections on a firm level converted into Asset Value Projections\nTo forecast earnings on a firm level, we augment the GCAM framework with a model of competition within each market. Firms\nwith potential differences in average as well as marginal costs set profit-maximizing output prices, converging to equilibrium\nmarket shares and earnings. Other than the calibration based on current market shares, the main driver of heterogeneity\nbetween firms are the emissions-intensity and energy-intensity of production. These different intensities, derived through firms’\nscope 1 and scope 2 emissions from the MESG dataset, cause relative costs to change over time as emissions and energy costs\n(typically) rise within a transition scenario. The result is a forecast on how each firm’s market share and earnings will change\nover time as a result of its new level of economic competitiveness. These are converted into projections of asset values. We\nemploy standard discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques, while giving users full ability to vary discount factors to their own\ncalibrations.\nStep 3: Measuring the effect of the scenario-conditional asset value process on EDF metrics\nThe new asset value process links directly to the drivers of EDF, in turn giving a full term structure of scenario-conditional EDF\nmetrics.\n5.1 Sectoral Analysis: Integrated Assessment Model\nGCAM is at its heart a complex demand framework, where both downstream producers and end consumers choose between\ndifferent goods based on both the relative costs of the goods and non-price relative preferences between them. As the transition\nscenario affects costs of production through emissions taxes, energy prices, capital investment, and technological growth,\ndownstream buyers adjust their consumption share of each good accordingly. Figure 19 shows a simplified diagram of the GCAM\nproduct demand structure. On the left-hand side, resource producers extract raw energy materials from each region’s energy\nreserves. Downstream, energy transformation industries convert these raw energy products into final energy types. Final energy\nis transmitted through energy carriers to end-product sectors that consume the final energy. Demand of final products are a\nfunction of population, income growth, and the price of final goods. Note the locations on the graph where multiple arrows\npoint to one industry. This represents multiple production technologies that are competing within a broad industry, each taking\ndifferent inputs upstream. Downstream producers and end consumers choose among technologies, creating market shares for\neach technology. Because of the multi-level demand structure, consumer choice between two products several levels\ndownstream can affect demand for each product’s inputs at the beginning of the production chain.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 23To see how upstream and downstream product choice fits together to create equilibrium sectoral prices and shares, observe the\nGCAM example market structure laid out in Figure 20. In this heuristic example, assume electricity can be generated only by\nburning coal or using solar power. Coal-powered and solar-powered electricity generation technologies each take two generic\ninputs, with these inputs’ costs determined by the cost of their production in upstream markets. Via the cost equations, the cost\nof producing each type of electricity is a function of the price of these inputs, as well as the intensity (input-output ratio) of\ntheir use in production of electricity output. Note that the price of each technology is equivalent to its cost of production.\nBy solving for the general equilibrium of the GCAM, we recover several objects for each sector: the price, the quantity, as well\nas the costs of different kinds of inputs (they are the prices of upstream goods). Furthermore, each GCAM object is dynamic—\nwe observe its current realization as well as the future ones. Nevertheless, granular as the markets in the GCAM can get, they\nremain sector-level outputs. While sectors—such as solar and coal energy—compete against each other, there is no strategic\ninteraction within sectors. Therefore, to utilize GCAM sector-level output for making firm-level predictions, another model is\nneeded. For this purpose, we develop an oligopoly model and leverage on the concept of Nash equilibrium. The model is\ndescribed in the next sub-section.\n5.2 Firm-Level Analysis: Moody’s Oligopoly Model\nThe perfect/monopolistic competition assumption implicit to the GCAM framework implies free entry and exit. This means that\nany excess profits earned by firms in the industry are quickly whittled away by entry, ultimately resulting in zero economic\nprofits in equilibrium (price equals average cost for each firm). Contrary to this result, observed empirical profit margins are not\nonly very different across firms and sectors, but also these differences remain persistent over long periods of time. A more\nrealistic representation of these markets is therefore oligopolistic competition. This market structure, assumes entry barriers and\nfirm heterogeneity, and results in a finite number of firms with the ability to set profit-maximizing prices. The Moody’s oligopoly\nmodel thus involves differentiated products, costs, and prices across firms. The costs depend on the scope 1 and 2 emissions,\nwhich determine the differentiation among firms. We first describe the key output metrics.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 245.2.1 Revenues and Earnings\nThe model has two core outputs—climate-adjusted revenues and earnings, defined as follows:\nRevenuef = Qf Pf (6)\n×\nEarningsf = Revenuef − Cf × Qf (7)\nThe latter can also be expressed as:\nEarningsf = (Pf − Cf ) × Qf (8)\nIn which:\n- Qf is the normalized quantity produced by each firm,\n- Pf is the firm-specific price,\n- Cf is the firm-specific cost per normalized unit of output.\n5.2.2 Quantities\nFirm-specific quantities are given by:\nQf = Sf × Qm (9)\nwhere Sf is the market share of a firm and Qm is the market output. The market-level price is given by:\n(10)\nwhere F is the sector for the firm f and\n(11)\nThere are two parameters for the market demand function. is firm-specific and is market-specific. Assuming we know\nthe two demand parameters and the firm price, we can obtain Qf as follows: 𝑚𝑚\n𝛼𝛼𝑓𝑓 𝛽𝛽\n- Use prices Pi, i∈ F to compute the market share Sf .\n- Weighting the price for each firm by its market share, get the market price .\n𝑚𝑚\n- Assuming we know demand elasticity (to be discussed later), we obtain the output quantity for each market Qm given the\n𝑃𝑃\nprice .\n𝑚𝑚\n𝑃𝑃\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 25- Finally, use the market shares again to get firm quantities from the market quantities Qm.\n5.2.3 Costs\nFor each technology sector and period, GCAM generates multiple costs variables. They can be aggregated into objects that\ncorrespond to average (i.e., per unit) costs associated with direct scope 1 emissions c (t), indirect scope 2 emissions c (t), and\ncosts not associated with emissions cother (t). We can construct firm-level average co 1sts as follows:\n2\nCf (t) = a × c (t) + a × c (t) + cother (t) (12)\n1 1 2 2\nin which a and a are time-independent, firm-specific parameters by which emission and electricity costs respectively are\nincreased as carbon taxes get imposed. They are defined as follows:\n1 2\n(13)\nwhere\n(14)\nIntensities are either provided directly by MESG whenever available or can be calculated using scope 1 and 2 emissions as\ninput. If scope 1 and 2 emissions are not available, we use industry averages, i.e. a = a = 1. We suppress the t subscript for\nthe sake of brevity in the subsequent derivation.\n1 2\nFor example, for Chevron in the early policy scenario for oil and natural gas extraction in 2045 we have a = .9603, a = .9720\nand (normalized) cost is Cf = 100.389.\n1 2\n5.2.4 Prices\nIt follows from the firm profit maximization problem and the Nash equilibrium for the oligopoly model that prices are\ndetermined by solving the following system of equations for such that:\n{ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 }𝑖𝑖∈𝐹𝐹\n(15)\nNote that both Pm and Si are functions of and is a parameter associated with the market price . The detailed\nderivation of (15) is provided in Appendix A.3.

If yes𝑚𝑚, the algorithm𝑃𝑃 concludes, if 𝑆𝑆n𝑖𝑖 o∈𝐹𝐹 t, we update our\n𝛽𝛽 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖∈𝐹𝐹\nguess to another value and iterate until convergence. For each firm f,\n′\n𝑚𝑚\n𝛽𝛽\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 26(16)\nas market shares are given in the base period.\n𝑆𝑆𝑓𝑓\n5.2.6 Market Elasticities Calculation\nThe last key missing parameter to be defined and estimated is the market elasticity . We have previously remarked that\nGCAM produces a set of variables for narrowly defined sectors for each one of the NGFS c𝑚𝑚limate scenarios. Let us now elaborate.\nThe output incorporates multilevel results on different regions, sectors, subsectors and 𝜋𝜋technologies. A market represents the\ncombination of regional and sector information. The term for a specific goods market in GCAM is a technology. Each\ntechnology is bundled in a set of similar technologies called a subsector, and each subsector with a set of similar subsectors\ncalled a sector. For each of these levels, GCAM provides a series of estimated future projections from which prices (costs),\nsupply, demand, CO2 emissions, CO2 sequestration, and emissions costs are used. Consumers or downstream producers can\nchoose not only between different sectors, but also between different subsectors within a sector, and different technologies\nwithin a subsector. Grouping technologies in this way allows for rich substitution patterns between technologies as customers\nchoose between options.\nWe need the substitution elasticities and equilibrium market shares at each of these levels to calculate the full market demand\nelasticity for each technology. As shown previously, they determine the output for each market.\nTo estimate market demand elasticity, the entire path of demand for each good needs to be known. This passes out of a firm’s\nsector, downstream to the next sector/subsector/technology, and then potentially onto several other the next\nsector/subsector/technology combinations, until it reaches a the final good market (i.e. the market for a good that is not an\ninput). The first step of achieving this is to line up the full stream of output-input relationships downstream from goods produced\nwithin each technology. This is possible because we have the input good and the output good for every technology provided in\nthe GCAM output. Since we have that:\n(17)\nand, similarly:\n(18)\nan increase in price of a technology (Ptech) will not only decrease the market share of the technology within the subsector, but\nalso put upward pressure on subsector and sector prices respectively. This means that the sector quantity sold will decrease, as\ntechnologies downstream that use this good will see their prices increase, and thus lower their market share in the same way:\nQtech = Qsector × SectorSharesubsector × Subsector Sharetech (19)\nFor that reason, calculating the exact impact of a price increase (the critical component of elasticity) is challenging.

One could think about it as of an intercept—\nif we assume then log Q = log + log . In the system o𝜎𝜎f equations determining prices, the parameter cancels out\nand therefore does not𝛽𝛽 affect the end result.\n𝑄𝑄 = 𝛼𝛼𝑃𝑃 𝛼𝛼 𝛽𝛽 𝑃𝑃\nAssuming constant demand elasticity makes computing the effect of changing price of the final good on its demand\nstraightforward. However, suppose that the price of an intermediate good needed to produce the final good changes. Then, we\nhave to figure out how the price of the final good is affected in order to determine the final quantity impact. To do so, we first\ncompute the extent to which the producer of the final good will substitute away from the more expensive input—that is, the\nchange in the market share of the producer of the intermediate good. Knowing the cost of the new combination of inputs used\nto produce the final good, we compute its new price and quantity. With this in hand, we can determine the final demand for\nthe intermediate good—given its altered share in the market for inputs. If the price of a second-tier intermediate good changes\n(i.e., a good necessary to produce the intermediate good), we proceed the same way, except that the chain has now two links.\nSome supply chains in GCAM can have as many as 28 links.\n5.2.7 Scenario Adjustment\nInformation necessary to run GCAM (including the model itself), NGFS assumptions, as well as the NGFS database of the I AM\noutput that corresponds to each climate scenario, are publicly available. However, when regulators conduct exercises intended\nto measure resilience of various institutions to climate shocks, the exact data used as GCAM (or an alternative IAM) inputs are\nnot widely distributed. Due to the relatively long run times, it is not feasible to reverse engineer these inputs by repeatedly\nrunning the model. Therefore, to ensure consistency between the GCAM output for each climate scenario run locally and the\npublic NGFS dataset, a we designed a scenario adjustment procedure.\nThe granular information of GCAM output at the market, sectoral, subsectoral and technology levels is initially aggregated into\nthe respective broader categories that match the regulator’s grouping. A comparison between the two datasets allows for\ncalculation of adjustment factors for carbon prices, emissions, prices, and quantities in the GCAM output to match the NGFS\noutput at the broader categories level. Some of the changes that are applied to incorporate the NGFS directives, which vary\nbetween different releases of the climate scenarios and their corresponding IAM outputs, are future projections of exogenous\ntechnological growth assumptions, and socioeconomic growth. As we run GCAM scenarios locally, we get more output variables,\ni.e. detailed sectoral and subsectoral information, than are typically provided by the NGFS or other regulatory bodies. For all\ndefault scenarios to date, we attempt to match the assumptions of a predefined scenario, such as that of the NGFS. We calculate\nadjustment factors such that GCAM aggregate sectoral, subsectoral and technological groups follow the same growth path over\ntime as the regulator’s aggregate groups. These newly calculated adjustment factors are then applied to the original GCAM\noutput, representing the more granular grouping that is used by our model.\n5.3 From Climate Scenarios to EDF\nThe effect of each transition scenario on EDF metrics is modeled by forecasting the firm’s expected earnings path conditional\non a given scenario, and then converting that earnings path to a firm asset value process. These steps are detailed in Figure 21.\nWe first forecast future earnings that equal to a product of a profit margin in each period and quantity sold. As discussed\npreviously, this is achieved by GCAM at the sectoral level and the Moody’s oligopoly model at the firm level. This process allows\nus to calculate firm level costs over time, the optimal prices each firm sets in equilibrium, the market share of each firm as a\nfunction of these prices, and ultimately, each firm’s earnings path. Next, we take the expected earnings paths for the firm and\nuse corresponding discounting factors to estimate the expected firm asset value path today and at any point in the future. The\ndiscount factors take into account both the time value of money and the risk aversion to the volatility of earnings around its\nexpected value. Finally, we convert the asset value path to its effect on EDF drivers and calculate the term structure of EDFs\nfrom these conditional driver paths.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 285.4 Case Study: Chevron Corp\nFigure 22 shows the paths for earnings, assets, and climate adjusted EDF (including changes with respect to the baseline) for\nChevron Corp. The figures reveal that disorderly scenarios are particularly stressful. For instance, one can see that in the divergent\nnet zero scenario, lower earnings (a) translate through discounted cash flow methods into lower asset values (b). Lower asset\nvalues, being a main EDF driver increase the EDF across the tenor, (c) and (d).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 296. Portfolio Analysis\nWe have so far analyzed firms in isolation. Next, we are going to analyze groups of firms (i.e., portfolios). This allows us to\nidentify patterns and firm characteristics that drive the exposure to physical and transition risk.\n6.1 Physical Risk\nFigure 23 depicts the average relative increase in 30-year EDFs driven by physical risk for our sample of companies. These firms\nface different level of exposure to physical risk, which is captured by the climate risk scores.\n6.2 Transition Risk\nTable 4 presents the distribution of the relative increase in 1-year and 10-year EDFs due to transition risk.

Climate PD Converter\nTo further increase the coverage and usability of the framework, Moody’s Analytics has built the Climate PD Converter. Figure\n26 shows the converter’s general approach. Users provide a baseline unconditional 1-year PD for each name, as well as some\nimportant characteristics of the firm associated with its climate exposure and long-term baseline risk. Location and industry are\nmandatory inputs while the company’s size and emissions are optional. Based on this data, the converter constructs a custom\nentity, calculating expected values of any missing characteristics given the information provided. The custom name is then run\nthrough the physical and/or transition risk models to create full climate-adjusted PDs (and associated credit metrics) for the\nentity. The output of the tool includes the CEDF term structure and implied ratings. While not a part of the tool output, various\nbond metrics can be generated as well.\n7.1 Use Cases\nThe adopted approach is useful for the following use cases:\n» Climate-adjusted risk for unlisted private names and small and medium enterprises (SMEs): For private names, the\nstructural Public EDF framework provides a more advantageous methodology for understanding the effects of climate\nchange than many of the reduced form credit models standardly employed for the asset class. To take advantage of the\nClimate-Adjusted EDF methodology, Moody’s Analytics provides climate-adjusted RiskCalc™ EDF credit measures for\nprivate names using the Climate PD Converter.\n» Custom entities and “generic firms” for an industry/region: Users may be interested in understanding the relative\nclimateinduced credit risk for hypothetical names based on certain characteristics. This can be especially useful for\nmodeling on the sectoral and regional level, allowing measurement of average risk increase for a pool of similar\nexposures.\n» Employing user-provided unconditional PDs in the framework: Users may have their own internal or reduced form credit\nmodel and may wish for the output of climate-stressed conditional PDs to be consistent with this input. The Climate\nPD Converter allows them to input their own baseline/unconditional PD and stress these risk values based on the values\nprovided.\nTable 5 shows inputs for a company located in Singapore in the sector of Nuclear Fuel Generation. The EDF for Transition Risk\nillustrates how the company actually benefits from transition as the EDF actually declines in the Delayed Transition scenarios—\nsee Figure 27.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 33Table 5: Climate PD Converter Input - Example\nBaseline Risk Firm Characteristics\nCarbon Scope 1 Scope 2\nPD Country Industry Sales Assets\nFootprint Emissions Emissions\n2.00% Singapore Nuclear Fuel Generation 125 mUSD 250 mUSD 850,000 3,600,000 50,000\n7.2 Custom Entity Construction\nThe Custom Entity construction is at the core of the Climate PD Converter as it allows to extend the domain of the previously\ndescribed methodology designed originally for public companies. As we have seen, the value and volatility of a firm’s assets are\nsufficient to infer its EDF in this case, assuming constant values of liabilities (the default point). Volatility tells us how much\nasset value could change in the future, rendering the probability that it will be insufficient to cover the firm’s liabilities, in which\ncase a default occurs. For the publicly traded firms, we know the quoted market price for its equity at any point in time. As the\nmarket value of assets and equity are interlinked via elementary accounting rules, we can infer how asset value of a public firm\nhas evolved historically. That is indicative of its future evolution. This idea underlies the use of Black-Scholes-Merton type\nmodels for credit risk. The primary limitation of this approach is that there are relatively few public firms compared to the ones\nheld privately. For private firms, equity prices are not quoted on a regular basis, so we know very little about how the market\nvalue of their assets evolve. However, the methodology for public companies is to extract the path for the value of assets. With\nthat accomplished, we can make the same kind of adjustments for physical and transition climate risk as we do for public firms.\nThus, we obtain the climate-adjusted EDF term structure.\nAs discussed above, the PD converter relies on the following firm-level data:\n1. The markets in which the firm operates (countries and industries),\n2. Firm size (measured by assets and sales),\n3. Exposure to climate change (physical score and reliance upon carbon emissions),\n4. Other financial figures related to the firms’ credit risk (initial PD, asset volatility, etc.).\nNot all inputs are required. Many items can be imputed based on information we have on the typical values for firms operating\nin the same region and/or industry, as discussed below. The first step is to approximate the missing values. If sales or asset value\nare missing, we infer them based on industry averages. If the PD is missing, we leverage ratings provided by the user to\napproximate it. With the PD and asset value available, we can evaluate the current asset volatility, as the structural model\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON CORPORATE CREDIT RISK 34renders a connection between the three values (EDF, asset value and volatility). Then, with region, industry, sales and asset value\nin place, we can estimate the firm’s Central Default Tendency, i.e., its EDF in the very long run. This is critical, as it allows us to\nutilize a proprietary model that exploits the relationship between long-term default probability and asset volatility to estimate\nthe latter. That gives us a long-term asset volatility. By interpolating between the current asset volatility from the Black-Scholes-\nMerton model and the long-run asset volatility implied by the Central Default Tendency, we get a volatility term structure. With\nasset value, sales (an excellent proxy for earnings) and volatility (over time) we are in position to approximate the EDF term\nstructure of the firm (not yet climate adjusted) using the Black-Scholes-Merton framework—see Denghan, Nazeran, and Dwyer\n(2017)14 and Nazeran, P., and Dwyer, D. (2015).15\n7.3 Climate Risk Adjustment\n7.3.1 Physical Risk\nA firm’s exposure to physical risk is captured by MESG physical scores, which is a way of incorporating expected global damages\ninto the firm’s financials. In the PD converter, firms are assigned the MESG sovereign score from their respective country. When\na firm operates in multiple countries, the score becomes an average of the relevant sovereign scores, weighted by the share of\nrevenue the firm gets from each country. From this point onwards the model proceeds just like for public firms. Note that\nindustry has no impact on physical risk as the sovereign score does not take it into account. In practice, one would want\nexposures to differ across industries, even for the same country. For example, some facilities may be located closer to water\nthan others on average. Nevertheless, the physical risk model partially compensates for this by assuming that firms with more\nvolatile assets tend to be hit more heavily by acute weather events.\n7.3.2 Transition Risk\nThe integrated assessment model that underlies our transition risk framework—GCAM—provides us with output at very granular\nmarket levels (regions and technologies). The PD Converter maps the clients’ firms to the markets in which they operate through\nthe user-provided countries and industries. Carbon emissions are the key drivers of transition risk. They are used to construct\nintensities (emissions over revenue) at the sector-region level for each firm. Leveraging on the user-provided information on the\ncompany’s industry and country, the PD Converter separates the company’s revenue and emissions in all relevant region-market\ncombination (country -> NERJ region and industry -> transition industries). If scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are not provided,\nthe PD converter has two ways of imputing them:\n» If the user provides only the total amount of carbon emissions, scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are calculated using the\nindustry level average share of each scope in the total.\n» If no information on emissions is provided, we assume that the company has the same intensity as the industry average.\nHence, its emissions-related costs increase at the same rate as they do for the entire industry.\nTable 6: Impact of User-provided Inputs (First Order)\n- Baseline Physical Risk Transition Risk\nCountry ADT, AEDF, REDF MESG Sovereign Score GCAM - Market modelling\nIndustry ADT - GCAM - Market modelling\n1-year EDF / Rating EDF 1st Tenor - -\nAssets ADT - -\nSales ADT - Costs\nCarbon Emissions - - Costs\n14 Denghan, H., Nazeran, P., and Dwyer, D.
