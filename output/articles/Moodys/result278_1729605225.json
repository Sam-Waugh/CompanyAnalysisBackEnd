Liquidity risk has evolved into high-profile deposit outflows, with\nensuing solvency incidents for institutions such as First Republic and Silicon\nValley Bank (SVB). For more than a decade, the banking sector has\noperated in a low interest rate environment, with the last comparable surge\nin interest rates dating back to the 1980s. Current continued hikes in\ninterest rates by central banks, as they battle persistent inflation, mark the\nend of the ‘interest rate holiday’ and the era of cheap money.\nThe ramifications of relaxed balance sheet rigor and investment approaches\ndesigned for lower, more stable interest rate regimes are already playing out\nin the mark-to-market losses for US banks. And the new interest rate\nenvironment is prompting a wide range of institutions – including those in\nthe ‘shadow banking’ industry – to re-evaluate their ALM and investment\nstrategies.\nGiven these new industry conditions and the evolving monetary\nenvironment, our 2023 report returns to the key themes highlighted by our\n2021 industry report. In this update, we re-evaluate the complex ALM\nframework, which broadly comprises distinct segments that include funds\ntransfer pricing (FTP), liquidity risk management (LRM) and reporting,\ncapital and balance sheet optimization, and ALM analytics and\nPage 3 of 48quantification. We examine the various challenges firms face as industry and\nregulatory standards push them to integrate their ALM operations and unify\ntheir ALM policies under a comprehensive internal strategy. Among the key\ntrends we highlight is the renewed focus on LRM in the context of different\ntypes of institution and their specific liquidity dynamics. We also consider\nthe adjacent focus on interest rate risk, including ‘straightforward’ interest\nrate risk.\nIn addition to our industry analysis, we also highlight trends in the regionally\ndefined, fragmented vendor market. We explore the different ALM\nrequirements that emerge from varying perspectives within an institution,\nfrom the standpoint of both the asset-liability committee (ALCO) and the\ntreasury department. We make the distinction between ‘operational ALM’,\nwhich focuses on day-to-day ALM calculations, and ALM from a trading and\nhedging perspective. We also note the approach to ALM that closely aligns\nwith regulatory reporting and compliance and, in addition to regional trends,\nwe highlight the institution types and product and balance sheet strategies\nthat drive different ALM requirements. Finally, we consider these trends\nthrough both operational and technological lenses, to determine how\nfinancial institutions and the vendor landscape are evolving under new\npressures.\nSince our analysis focuses on ALM analytics as a wide-ranging and diverse\nuniverse, we will outline our broader findings in follow-up publications. Our\nfuture coverage will include the challenges of modeling ‘run risk’ in financial\nmarkets, evolving regulation, and an examination of behavioral modeling –\nand, specifically, details around liquidity strategies and metrics.\nThis report uses Chartis’ RiskTech Quadrant® to explain the structure of the\nmarket. The RiskTech Quadrant® employs a comprehensive methodology of\nin-depth independent research and a clear scoring system to explain which\ntechnology solutions meet an organization’s needs.

An essential part of ALM is the\neffective capture of liquidity requirements and interest rate sensitivities to\ninform funding decisions, as well as hedging and investment strategies. In\nessence, ALM is the process of managing and optimizing the assets and\ncashflows that financial institutions use to meet their obligations.\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, however, ALM as a discipline has matured.\nUnder the Basel era, the ALCO’s oversight has become wider than ever, as\nbanks’ ALM programs encompass more and more integrated risks.\nConverging regulatory requirements, including credit accounting standards\nand capital requirements, are pushing banks to assign greater strategic\nimportance to broader ALM programs. Despite the regulatory overhaul\nfollowing the 2008 financial crisis and the emphasis on stress tests, the\nSVB incident more recently has caused regulators to take another look at\nthe way aspects of the banking sector are governed. US regulators, in\nparticular, are re-evaluating liquidity frameworks and insured deposit\nthresholds.\nThe confluence of factors that led to SVB’s collapse ‒ duration risk, treasury\nbond performance and deposit flight – has signaled to the industry that\ninadequate ALM can cause banking failures and considerable distrust\namong depositors and investors. More than ever before, banks are\nexpected to forecast their short- and long-term cashflows and product\nstrategies under a range of scenarios, including stressed conditions. With\nthat expectation comes a focus on analytics and data management.\nPage 5 of 48Managing the balance sheet across departments – aligning\nperspectives\nThe interlocking analytical and operational activities that constitute ALM are\nspread across different departments in financial institutions. The\nresponsibilities of these departments define distinct perspectives of the\nbalance sheet, and the significance of the role they play in ALM depends on\na bank’s business model and its trading-related exposure (see Figure 1d. The\nChief Risk Officer’s (CRO) department sets the risk appetite for different risk\ncategories, while the Chief Finance Officer’s (CFO) department is\nresponsible for liquidity, capital management, accounting and reporting. The\ntreasury department defines FTP and monitors liquidity, while the ALCO\nsteers the overall direction of an institution’s ALM (see Figure 2d. The\nsignificance of the treasury unit in ALM activities is often defined by the\nlevel of a bank’s trading activity.\nThe way that different institutions structure and organize their ALM\noperations varies tremendously across the banking sector. However, the\nchallenge of aligning these perspectives across disciplines is industry-wide.\nThe operational and risk management processes that ALM requires cannot\nbe neatly compartmentalized into departments, especially in larger and more\ncomplex businesses. Advanced modeling processes, dynamic balance sheet\nforecasting and granular data can all support an increasingly integrated view\nof the balance sheet and strategic planning. Processes such as FTP enable\nproduct design and planning to be linked to the whole balance sheet.\nPage 6 of 48Figure 1: Managing the balance sheet – an overview\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 7 of 48Figure 2: Managing the balance sheet – functions and\nsegments\n•Strategicplan\n•Balanceprojections\n•Incomeprojections\nEconomy\nBank\n•Businessplan\nEconomicand •Balancesheet Treasury\ncapitalmarkets forecasts\nscenarios\nALM/ETP\nTreasury\n•FTPforecasts\n•Fundingplan\n•Capitalplan\nSource: Chartis Research\nALM as a complex set of interlocking analytical and operational\nactivities\nFor effective ALM, firms must forecast and manage the risks and market\nconditions to which their balance sheet is exposed. A range of interlocking\nanalytical and operational activities has developed to support these\nforecasting and management demands (see Figure 3d. Multiple vendor\nsolutions and varied models have also evolved to meet the complex and\nvaried demands of different institution types. Despite this complexity, ALM\nanalytics can be split into three dimensions that encompass the various\ndemands facing financial institutions (see Figure 4d.\nPage 8 of 48Figure 3: ALM is a complex set of interlocking analytical and\noperational activities\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 9 of 48Figure 4: ALM analytics can be seen in three dimensions\nSource: Chartis Research\nIn addition to dealing with interlocking analytical requirements, financial\ninstitutions must manage and reconcile varying perspectives of the balance\nsheet and income statement that are generated by distinct calculations\nacross different time horizons. Besides accommodating diverse modeling\nmethodologies and computational and data requirements, firms also need to\nreconcile different metrics. Net interest income (NII), for instance, is\ndesigned to measure an institution’s short-term income sensitivity to\ninterest rate changes. The economic value of equity (EVE), however, is\nmeasured over a longer time horizon, and assesses the degree of a bank’s\nPage 10 of 48interest rate risk exposure by calculating the net present value of the\ncashflows on its balance sheet. These metrics were developed to show the\neffects of interest rates on banks’ earnings, as well as the market value of\nfair-valued instruments. Despite their different scope and purpose, when\nthese metrics offer inconsistent views of a firm’s position in certain market\nconditions, they can be hard to reconcile, especially from the perspective of\na balance sheet strategy.\nFirms are also facing pressure to implement effective performance\nattribution analytics and optimization methods for their portfolios and\nbalance sheets. Sophisticated optimization strategies go beyond income\nsimulation, and can support optimal strategy insights; however, in general,\nthis is a relatively less mature part of the ALM value chain. While the ALM\nanalytics ecosystem is complex, with challenging integration demands, a\nbroad range of mathematical tools is becoming more widely available (see\nFigure 5d. These tools can handle both short- and long-term ALM demands,\nand we will examine their applications and uptake in this report.\nFigure 5: A broad range of mathematical tools is required for\nboth short- and long-term ALM and balance sheet\nchallenges\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 11 of 48ALM in action: key market trends\nThis section provides an overview of the key ALM trends in 2023, some of\nwhich are explored in more detail later.\nMathematical frameworks in ALM are becoming increasingly\nsophisticated\nALM practitioners are benefiting from a wider range of tools, including\nreverse stress testing, standardized and structured stress and scenario-\ngeneration mechanisms, and better cashflow and consolidation engines for\nthe banking book. By being able to access detailed, granular cashflow for\nthe banking book, firms can subject it to more effective and formal\nanalytical techniques.\nA broader recognition of interest rate risk on the balance sheet\nOver the next 10 years, the banking industry will experience a period of\ngreater interest rate volatility. A persistently low interest rate environment\nhas put sustained pressure on banks’ margins. Current high interest rates,\nhowever, are creating liquidity and capital issues, as banks’ liability\npayments risk becoming greater than their asset earnings.\nChartis has identified the following high-level challenges that are emerging\nfrom this new environment:\nEmbedded leverage risk exists in a wide variety of locations, such as the\nrepurchase agreement (repo) market, elements of collateral, and non-\nbanking institutions (including asset managers and pension funds).\nExposure to these risks has already been seen in the market in the shape\nof the crisis in UK pension fund gilts, which has highlighted the issues with\nliability-driven investment (LDI).\nInterest rate risk is embedded in a variety of products, such as\nguaranteed products within the insurance industry.\nInstitutions including retail banks, money market mutual funds and life\ninsurance companies, as well as long-dated investment vehicles, are\nexposed to customer behavior dynamics that relate to interest rate risk.\nDuring higher interest rate periods, for instance, customers display an\nincreasing unwillingness to hold long-dated assets, and shift toward the\nuse of cash. These dynamics also emerge in areas such as bank loans that\nare made to wholesale institutions exposed to interest rate risk.\nPage 12 of 48Increasing convergence in ALM across financial services\nALM is converging across the capital markets, banking and insurance\nsectors. Methodologies, mechanics and techniques differ, but cross-\npollination between these sectors is causing these differences to lessen.\nThe banking book, for example, looks at interest rate risk derived, analyzed\nand extracted from other markets. There are elements of convergence\nbetween the capital markets side and the banking-book side of a bank,\nwhile loan markets are now being reasonably priced by Current Expected\nCredit Losses (CECL) or International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRSd 9,\nboth of which take a forward-looking view of risk management. Insurance\nALM, particularly in the US, is becoming marketized, and, in buy-side and\ninsurance contexts, optimization tools are comparatively more mature.\nLiquidity risk analysis will be a central feature of ALM\nChartis believes that, going forward, liquidity risk analysis will be a central\nfeature of ALM. But it is important that regulators carefully consider the\ncauses of the current crisis, rather than ‘fighting the last war’. The current\nissues in the market around liquidity risk are in some ways fundamental to\nthe banking business model, and are inherent in interest rate transformation\n(such as converting short-dated rolling deposits into long-dated assets).\nThe Chartis view: the implications of the\nSilicon Valley Bank collapse for ALM –\nregulators and financial institutions respond\nMarket practitioners are examining the consequences of the collapse of\nSVB for ALM. The bank’s duration risk and lack of asset and liability\nbalance is highlighting the ability of ALM and banks to meet withdrawals\nwith enough liquidity. SVB’s collapse also triggered wider conversations\nabout government intervention, regional bank requirements and\nsupervisory oversight. Despite current speculation around the missteps\nthat may have contributed to SVB’s collapse, Chartis is focusing on the\nstructural challenges.\nMany of the issues SVB faced are common to other institutions, for\nexample. The problems at SVB re-emphasized the central challenge\nsurrounding institutional/semi-institutional counterparties and\nPage 13 of 48concentration risk (around regional, sectoral and interlinked\ncounterparties). The incident also highlighted the heightened risk of runs\nagainst financial institutions when comparatively less-regulated, higher-\nyielding products are available (such as money market mutual funds, for\nexample), as well as the effects of the deep structural changes in the\ninformation environment in which institutions operate. Digitalization that\nenables the rapid/instantaneous movement of money, as well as social\nmedia and information networks, all contributed to the conditions that\nled to a bank run.\nThe core structural challenge – which Chartis will continue to analyze in\nfuture research – is how to handle a large concentration of depositors\nand counterparties. We will examine what a run on a financial institution\nentails, considering which features initially attract investors (such as\ncontract flexibility), and which may drive runs when market conditions\nchange in times of stress.\nTrends in detail\nA new banking landscape: navigating shifting interest rate\nregimes\nInterest rate risk in banking\nInterest rate management, a process of risk and term transformation, is\ncentral to the banking business. Interest rate modeling has a long legacy in\nALM, and interest-derived income is a central aspect of banks’ business\nmodels. Fluctuations in money and capital-market interest rates impact the\nvalue of a bank’s assets and liabilities, the timing of cashflows and the\neffectiveness of hedging strategies. Deposits are behaviorally sensitive and\nvary over time, for example, while other assets, such as mortgages and\nloans with prepayment rights, may also have similar uncertainties\nembedded in the system.\nPrepayment without penalty is a very specific characteristic of the US\nbanking industry, and has essentially created enormous structural risks\nwithin the banking book. Indeed, prepayment risk has been a major aspect\nof interest rate risk management in the US, but is increasingly a dynamic in\nother regions. Extremely sophisticated models and frameworks have been\nestablished to handle this type of interest rate risk. The residential\nPage 14 of 48mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) market, for example, developed around\nthis requirement. Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB), part of the\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Pillar 2 capital framework, was\ndeveloped to enable institutions to identify embedded interest rate risk in\ntheir balance sheets. The framework also covers embedded optionality in\nbanks’ interest rate-linked portfolios, and provides guidance on how to\nvalue them appropriately.\nThe evident challenges with SVB’s business model have sparked a wider\ndebate about the adequacy of supervisory requirements, and there is also a\nsense that SVB was flying under the regulatory radar. Its collapse highlights\nthe problems created by the two-tier regulatory system in the US.\nRequirements such as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) and the liquidity\ncoverage ratio (LCR), which apply widely to European and Asian institutions,\nhave not been applied to smaller and non-qualifying US banks. As a result,\nthe US system has been left with a small pool of banks that are highly\nregulated to international standards, and a second tier of smaller, less well-\nregulated institutions – particularly where liquidity requirements are\nconcerned.\nChartis believes that this will become a second-order problem over the next\nfew years. Regulators may try to unify and create a single regulatory regime,\nrather than having different liquidity regimes for small banks, an approach\nthat substantially undercuts the basic premise of unified regulations. The\ncurrent liquidity regime for smaller institutions also creates additional risks\nfor these firms, compared to very large institutions. In periods of stress,\ninvestors (particularly depositors) are more likely to move toward more\nregulated institutions. The lack of liquidity restrictions will therefore be a\nmedium-term problem for many smaller and mid-sized institutions.\nEconomic outlook: higher rates drive funding and liquidity\nchallenges\nThe status of interest rate risk and liquidity risk regulation and supervision is\nlikely to be the focus of significant debate over the coming years. This focus\nwill extend to how appropriately institutions manage balance sheet risk.\nGoing forward, investors, regulators and counterparties (including retail\ncounterparties) are likely to pay considerable attention to signs of weakness\nin broad balance sheet management strategies, increasing the importance\nof effective and efficient financial risk management. The overall current\nPage 15 of 48economic volatility is putting financial risk management at the core of\ninstitutions’ planning. Another aspect of the debate is the influence that\nmonetary policy is having on the stability of the financial system (see Figure\n6d.\nOver time, an expectation has developed that interest rates would never\nshift – and even if they did, it would only happen very slowly or by small\namounts. Clearly, currently high and persistent levels of inflation have\nupended many of these assumptions.\nPage 16 of 48Figure 6: Central bank policy rates\nSource: Bank for International Settlements\nShifts in ALM analytics and balance sheet modeling/management\nWe are witnessing a major shift in ALM analytics and balance sheet\nmodeling and management in banking. The combination of market\nconditions and regulatory requirements is encouraging a stronger focus on\nmodeling techniques and methodologies (see Figure 7d. Firms are employing\nan advanced approach known as ‘complex dynamic cashflow modeling’ to\nforecast future cashflows, by taking into account potential changes in a\nPage 17 of 48firm’s balance sheet composition in response to fluctuating interest rate\nenvironments. Uncertainty around cashflows and drawdowns during periods\nof economic stress can create challenges for financial institutions from the\nperspective of liquidity risk pricing and funding costs.\nIn the period of economic stress during the pandemic, levels of credit\nfacility drawdowns were at unprecedented highs, as corporate borrowers\nsought to shore up their liquidity. These drawdown rates contributed to\nbanks’ funding issues, with a portion of banks having to resort to wholesale\nmarket borrowing for liquidity. The liquidity risk profile of revolving credit\nfacilities is especially challenging, as borrowers have the option to draw\ndown additional credit or repay; these options need to be charged\naccurately by the treasury. As a practice, FTP has come of age, and within\nfinancial institutions there is a strong desire to charge every banking\nproduct accurately across all business lines – this includes under stressed\nconditions and when customer behavioral dynamics are incorporated.\nFigure 7: Industry trends and technology backdrop\nSource: Chartis Research\nRegulatory updates and regional trends\nLiquidity – a central focus\nThe Basel liquidity measurements were set up as an alternative to the\nintervention of regulators in ALM at a granular level. The NSFR and LCR\nPage 18 of 48were seen as mechanisms to prevent liquidity runs on institutions (see\nFigures 8 and 9d.\nFigure 8: Regional trends in banking\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 19 of 48Figure 9: Regulatory updates\nSource: Chartis Research\nThere are several ways in which liquidity risk can be managed. One is to\nincrease both deposit insurance limits and the cost of deposit insurance, so\nthat investors are paying appropriately for liquidity. Regulators must also\nensure that the cost of liquidity is borne not just by the banks, but also by\nany other institutions that offer banking-like, contingent, liquidity-type\nproducts. Banks should be competing on a level playing field with these\nother forms of liquidity (such as money market mutual funds). Given that\nthese institutions provide on-demand liquidity risk products, they should be\nregulated as such and have comparable deposit insurance programs in\nplace. Regulation would ensure that situations where liquidity risk simply\nmigrates from banks to other types of institution could be avoided,\npreventing bank-style runs in other firms.\nRegardless of regulation, however, the core issue does not go away.\nLiquidity risk is a central issue any time an institution conducts liquidity\ntransformation (i.e., takes short-dated assets and converts them into long-\ndated ones). The key issue is to price liquidity risk reasonably, and to ensure\nthat it is priced into individual products. The aim is not to stop liquidity\ntransformations altogether, or to privilege certain kinds of institutions that\nconduct them. Banking institutions have been conducting liquidity\ntransformations for a long time, and it is an easily understood process.\nPage 20 of 48However, transferring that liquidity risk from banks to other institutions\nmakes the transformation process less well understood, potentially opening\nit up to even more risk.\nFrom a regulator’s perspective, a balance of different types of liquidity risk is\nnot a bad thing. Certain kinds of institutions (such as private equity and\nreal-estate firms, as well as many of the private funds for private credit)\nhave a different liquidity profile, and tend to offer liquidity at much lower\nrates than banks and money market mutual funds.\nTaxonomizing liquidity risk\nChartis believes that there is a central lesson that should be learned from\nrecent crises: a proper taxonomy and analysis of the many different types of\nliquidity risk must be conducted on every type of institution in the market ‒\nand these different types of liquidity must be appropriately regulated.\nRegulation should not simply be applied across the board without\nconsidering the specific nature of the liquidity risk run by different\ninstitutions. In our view, a well-defined, carefully analyzed and well-\ntaxonomized liquidity risk framework would enable different institutions to\noffer a variety of liquidity risk products, and would lead to a generally more\nstable financial system. Regulators need to think about the varying costs of\ndifferent forms of liquidity. On-demand liquidity should be the most\nexpensive form, whereas the more that assets are locked in, the lower the\npayable liquidity premium should be.\nIt is vital that financial institutions and regulators think more carefully about\nthe dimensions of their liquidity risk. Liquidity risk covers a broad range of\ndimensions, and is far from straightforward. Historically, ALM terms were\noften highly restrictive. While the market has now moved to more\nsophisticated ALM frameworks, Chartis believes that many dimensions of\nliquidity risk are still not being properly addressed. Analytics are becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated across the board, but liquidity analytics in\nparticular are being affected by methodological innovations (see Figure 10d.\nPage 21 of 48Figure 10: The transformation of liquidity analytics\nSource: Chartis Research\nCore analytics frameworks: a process of integration and\ndifferentiation\nThe evolving industry standard for ALM requires multiple modeling regimes,\nvarying views of the balance sheet across different time horizons and\nconditions, and challenging data integrations. Increasingly, firms require\nsophisticated analytics to handle the expectation for better-informed\ngranular cashflows. Despite the development and greater availability of\nsophisticated modeling regimes, larger, more complicated banks are still\nlumbered with patchwork legacy systems.\nThe kind of vendor solution that financial institutions are looking for is\ndefined by their institutional complexity. While more complex systems can\nhandle a greater level of bespoke requirements, they also contribute to\nlonger implementation times. Processing speed is a specific computational\ncashflow-generation challenge for institutions with large volumes of\nPage 22 of 48transaction data. Innovative technical architectures are required so that\nfinancial institutions can process data at the frequencies required for\ncashflow generation, risk management and balance sheet planning. There\nare also significant benefits for financial institutions that can bring core\nmathematical techniques together across the trading, analytics and\noperational cycles (see Figure 11d.\nFigure 11: Core mathematical techniques\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 23 of 48The elements of analytics\nBehavioral modeling\nBehavioral modeling is a key aspect of the emerging, more sophisticated\nALM ecosystem, and is rapidly becoming an industry standard (see Figures\n12 and 13d. There are several approaches to behavioral modeling, including\nimporting data from capital market analogues, such as prepayment models\nfor securitization assets. An essential part of behavioral modeling is the\nability to model the nature and structure of clients and counterparties\naccurately. When clients and counterparties are highly distributed and\nlargely ‘retail’-focused, the behavioral dynamics that describe them can be\nvastly different from those that describe highly concentrated, largely\ninstitutional structures. Chartis argues that firms should leverage, or at least\nevaluate, behavioral and client-segmentation models used in other areas,\nsuch as financial crime, compliance, supply chain analytics and fraud\nanalytics. Client segmentation analysis has the potential to provide\nsignificant insights for the behavioral models used in ALM.\nIt is also important to take into account the contractual ‘flexibility’ afforded\nto clients and counterparties using an option theoretic perspective. There is\nan opportunity for firms to leverage the vast theoretical and practical work\nthat exists in the option modeling, pricing and analysis space. From the\nstandpoint of financial stability, it is also important that contract flexibility is\nnot restricted to banks, as it can lead to runs, and affects any institution\nthat provides this flexibility to a substantial degree.\nPage 24 of 48Figure 12: All aspects of behavioral modeling are\ndeveloping\nSource: Chartis Research\nFigure 13: Business behavioral dynamics can be seen\nthrough many lenses\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 25 of 48Data integration and managing transaction data\nData integration challenges have complex supply and demand dynamics.\nMore data is being generated from diverse sources – both internally and\nexternally. At the same time, a large number of new tools and techniques\nare hitting the market, as well as new databases, data management tools\nand integration capabilities. We are also seeing strong growth in new\ntechniques to filter, structure and search available data. Generating\ncashflows from transaction data is a core activity for most enterprises, and\nnew technologies (such as data grids, as well as other scalable database\ntools) can help to improve efficiency.\nCloud migration\nALM analytics are well-suited to the cloud. Cloud deployments allow\nfinancial institutions to consolidate cashflows, develop aggregations and\nrun behavioral models in their internal frameworks. Cloud deployments also\nenable firms to move consolidated cashflows to manage risk, and to run the\nbalance sheet through appropriate liquidity models, hedge analytics and\nbalance sheet forecasting risk and attribution models. The cloud is proving\nan increasingly popular choice for new deployments, although institutions’\ngeneral readiness for cloud adoption varies by region.\nClimate risk scenarios\nIncreasingly, some institutions and many vendors have started to\nincorporate climate risk scenarios. This is a developing area, and Chartis\nbelieves that the integration of climate risk into the ALM environment is not\nyet analytically mature. However, we expect considerable and rapid\nprogress in the context of scenario analytics.\nJump to top\nVendor landscape\nVendors in the ALM space continue to evolve and build increasingly\nsophisticated tools to meet market requirements. The structure of solutions\nvaries considerably, and the functionality vendors have developed is highly\ndependent on the requirements of the regions and institutions they serve.\nThe US asset-backed securities (ABS) market is a key dynamic for US\ninstitutions, and requires a degree of specialization on the vendor side. A\ncluster of US vendors focuses on ALM from a risk management, trading and\nhedging perspective, and these vendors are experienced in supporting\nPage 26 of 48financial institutions in managing their MBS. These providers support almost\ntrading-quality interest rate management systems; however, hedging in this\ncontext is far less frequent than in trading.\nKey themes in the landscape\nVendor consolidation\nOne key theme that Chartis has identified is consolidation among some of\nthe leading vendors, which has been driven by general-purpose vendors\nacquiring specialists. As a result, some of the more analytics- and platform-\noriented vendors have now incorporated considerable methodological\ncapabilities, increasing the ability for sophisticated analysis and driving\ncompetition at the top end of the market. Considering the current market\ncontext, this consolidation is especially timely. There will be substantive\nevolution in the way financial institutions think about ALM, in terms of not\nonly more sophisticated simulations, but also more careful analysis of\nindividual products and more focus on integrating product details, terms\nand conditions and other elements.\nThis evolution brings the much-neglected IRRBB to the fore. IRRBB needs\nto be expanded in a more sophisticated way to handle embedded risk\noptions in the trading book and in all aspects of a bank’s business. Non-\nbanking institutions also have massive embedded interest rate risk profiles,\nwhich need to be analyzed more carefully, especially given the expected\ninterest rate volatility in the next five to 10 years.\nChartis’ vendor analysis recognizes the consolidation trend that is bringing\nmethodology and platform together with general tool capacity, and\nincreasing the ability for sophisticated analysis. We have incorporated this\nas part of our scoring cycle.\nThe ALM vendor market – continued diversity and fragmentation\nDespite this consolidation, it is important to recognize the wide variety of\ndimensions in which vendors continue to differentiate themselves –\narguably, every major vendor has significantly different capabilities. This\nperspective is critical in understanding the vendor landscape and its\ncontinued diversity and fragmentation. Some of the differentiating\ndimensions include:\nPage 27 of 48The quality of behavioral analytics, and modeling and risk aggregation for\ncounterparties (including depositors).\nALM metrics and ALM metrics attribution.\nHedge analytics and balance sheet management (a financial perspective).\nBalance sheet management and optimization (an operational perspective).\nExtendibility/customization.\nData and workflow integration.\nScalable cashflow generation, which is important for many Asian\ninstitutions.\nOperational support and effective product pricing.\nLiquidity risk analytics.\nRegulatory focus and reporting.\nAlthough mergers and acquisitions have been a key dynamic in the ALM\nvendor market, as financial institutions across different regions continue to\nemphasize different elements, the variation in the vendor landscape has\ngrown. The vendor capabilities tables jTables 2, 4, 6, and 8d give a detailed\nperspective of vendors’ strengths in particular areas.\nJump to top\n®\nChartis RiskTech Quadrant and vendor\ncapabilities for ALM technology solutions, 2023\nFigure 14 illustrates Chartis’ view of the vendor landscape for ALM\nsolutions. Table 1 lists the completeness of offering and market potential\ncriteria we used to assess the vendors. Table 2 lists the vendor capabilities\nin this area.\nThe ALM quadrant is an omnibus category for ALM analytics, and the\nscoring criteria cover a broad spectrum of modeling frameworks. Liquidity\nrisk in this context is centered more on computational ALM than on liquidity\nrisk ratios and reporting. The boundaries between different types of ALM\nsolutions are not trivial. Some vendors may focus on hedge/balance sheet\nmanagement, while other solution types focus on ‘what-if’ analytics for\nfinance departments, accounting linkages between portfolios, and the\nintegration of credit risk events.\nPage 28 of 48Figure 14: RiskTech Quadrant® for ALM solutions, 2023\nSource: Chartis Research\nTable 1: Assessment criteria for vendors of ALM solutions, 2023\nCompleteness of offering Market potential\nCapabilities and breadth of analytics Customer satisfaction\nScenario management systems (including speciVc ESG support) Market penetration\nStress testing/reverse stress testing Growth strategy\nInterest rate modeling Business model\nSimulation engine(s) capability Financials\nLiquidity risk analytics\nBalance sheet analytics\nBehavioral modeling\nData management\nIntegration capabilities\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 29 of 48Table 2: Vendor capabilities for ALM solutions, 2023\nKey: ***** = Best-in-class capabilities; **** = Industry-leading capabilities; *** = Advanced capabilities; ** = Meets\nindustry requirements; * = Partial coverage/component capability\nSource: Chartis Research\nJump to top\nPage 30 of 48®\nChartis RiskTech Quadrant and vendor\ncapabilities for FTP technology solutions, 2023\nFigure 15 illustrates Chartis’ view of the vendor landscape for FTP solutions.\nTable 3 lists the completeness of offering and market potential criteria we\nused to assess the vendors.

Chartis provides\nindependent market intelligence regarding market dynamics, regulatory\ntrends, technology trends, best practices, competitive landscapes, market\nsizes, expenditure priorities, and mergers and acquisitions. Chartis’\n®\nRiskTech Quadrant reports are written by experienced analysts with\nhands-on experience of selecting, developing and implementing risk\nmanagement systems for a variety of international companies in a range of\nindustries, including banking, insurance, capital markets, energy and the\npublic sector.\nChartis’ research clients include leading financial services firms and Fortune 500\ncompanies, leading consulting firms and risk technology vendors. The risk\n®\ntechnology vendors that are evaluated in the RiskTech Quadrant reports can be\nChartis clients or firms with whom Chartis has no relationship. Chartis evaluates\nall risk technology vendors using consistent and objective criteria, regardless of\nwhether they are a Chartis client.\nWhere possible, risk technology vendors are given the opportunity to correct\nfactual errors prior to publication, but cannot influence Chartis’ opinion. Risk\ntechnology vendors cannot purchase or influence positive exposure. Chartis\nadheres to the highest standards of governance, independence and ethics.\n®\nInclusion in the RiskTech Quadrant\nChartis seeks to include risk technology vendors that have a significant presence\nin a given target market. The significance may be due to market penetration (e.g.,\nlarge client base) or innovative solutions. Chartis does not give preference to its\nown clients and does not request compensation for inclusion in a RiskTech\nJ QJJuuu ummm adppp ratttooo ntttt ®ooo rppp\neport. Chartis utilizes detailed and domain-specific ‘vendor evaluation\nforms’ and briefing sessions to collect information about each vendor. If a vendor\nchooses not to respond to a Chartis vendor evaluation form, Chartis may still\ninclude the vendor in the report. Should this happen, Chartis will base its opinion\non direct data collated from risk technology buyers and users, and from publicly\navailable sources.\nPage 40 of 48Research process\nThe findings and analyses in the RiskTech Quadrant ® reports reflect our analysts’\nconsidered opinions, along with research into market trends, participants,\nexpenditure patterns and best practices. The research lifecycle usually takes\nseveral months, and the analysis is validated through several phases of\nindependent verification. Figure 18 below describes the research process.\nFigure 18: RiskTech Quadrant® research process\nSource: Chartis Research\nPage 41 of 48Chartis typically uses a combination of sources to gather market intelligence. These\ninclude (but are not limited to):\nChartis vendor evaluation forms. A detailed set of questions covering\nfunctional and non-functional aspects of vendor solutions, as well as\norganizational and market factors. Chartis’ vendor evaluation forms are based\non practitioner-level expertise and input from real-life risk technology projects,\nimplementations and requirements analysis.\nRisk technology user surveys. As part of its ongoing research cycle, Chartis\nsystematically surveys risk technology users and buyers, eliciting feedback on\nvarious risk technology vendors, satisfaction levels and preferences.\nInterviews with subject matter experts. Once a research domain has been\nselected, Chartis undertakes comprehensive interviews and briefing sessions\nwith leading industry experts, academics and consultants on the specific domain\nto provide deep insight into market trends, vendor solutions and evaluation\ncriteria.\nCustomer reference checks. These are telephone and/or email checks with\nnamed customers of selected vendors to validate strengths and weaknesses,\nand to assess post-sales satisfaction levels.\nVendor briefing sessions. These are face-to-face and/or web-based briefings\nand product demonstrations by risk technology vendors. During these sessions,\nChartis experts ask in-depth, challenging questions to establish the real\nstrengths and weaknesses of each vendor.\nOther third-party sources. In addition to the above, Chartis uses other third-\nparty sources of information such as conferences, academic and regulatory\nstudies, and collaboration with leading consulting firms and industry\nassociations.\nEvaluation criteria\nThe RiskTech Quadrant® (see Figure 19) evaluates vendors on two key\ndimensions:\n1. Completeness of offering\n2. Market potential\nPage 42 of 48Figure 19: RiskTech Quadrant®\nSource: Chartis Research\nWe develop specific evaluation criteria for each piece of quadrant research from\na broad range of overarching criteria, outlined below. By using domain-specific\ncriteria relevant to each individual risk, we can ensure transparency in our\nmethodology and allow readers to fully appreciate the rationale for our analysis.\nCompleteness of offering\nDepth of functionality. The level of sophistication and number of detailed\nfeatures in the software product (e.g., advanced risk models, detailed and\nPage 43 of 48flexible workflow, domain-specific content). Aspects assessed include:\ninnovative functionality, practical relevance of features, user-friendliness,\nflexibility and embedded intellectual property. High scores are given to firms that\nachieve an appropriate balance between sophistication and user-friendliness. In\naddition, functionality linking risk to performance is given a positive score.\nBreadth of functionality. The spectrum of requirements covered as part of an\nenterprise risk management system. This varies for each subject area, but\nspecial attention is given to functionality covering regulatory requirements,\nmultiple risk classes, multiple asset classes, multiple business lines and multiple\nuser types (e.g., risk analyst, business manager, CRO, CFO, compliance\nofficer). Functionality within risk management systems and integration between\nfront office (customer-facing) and middle/back office (compliance, supervisory\nand governance) risk management systems are also considered.\nData management and technology infrastructure. The ability of risk\nmanagement systems to interact with other systems and handle large volumes\nof data is considered to be very important. Data quality is often cited as a critical\nsuccess factor and ease of data access, data integration, data storage and data\nmovement capabilities are all important factors. Particular attention is given to\nthe use of modern data management technologies, architectures and delivery\nmethods relevant to risk management (e.g., in-memory databases, complex\nevent processing, component-based architectures, cloud technology, software-\nas-a-service). Performance, scalability, security and data governance are also\nimportant factors.\nRisk analytics. The computational power of the core system, the ability to\nanalyze large amounts of complex data in a timely manner (where relevant in\nreal time), and the ability to improve analytical performance are all important\nfactors. Particular attention is given to the difference between ‘risk’ analytics and\nstandard ‘business’ analytics. Risk analysis requires such capabilities as non-\nlinear calculations, predictive modeling, simulations, scenario analysis, etc.\nReporting and presentation layer. The ability to present information in a timely\nmanner, the quality and flexibility of reporting tools, and ease of use are\nimportant for all risk management systems. Particular attention is given to the\nability to do ad hoc ‘on-the-fly’ queries (e.g., what-if analysis), as well as the\nrange of ‘out-of-the-box’ risk reports and dashboards.\nPage 44 of 48Market potential\nBusiness model. Includes implementation and support and innovation\n(product, business model and organizational). Important factors include size and\nquality of implementation team, approach to software implementation and post-\nsales support and training. Particular attention is given to ‘rapid’ implementation\nmethodologies and ‘packaged’ services offerings. Also evaluated are new ideas,\nfunctionality and technologies to solve specific risk management problems.\nSpeed to market, positioning and translation into incremental revenues are also\nimportant success factors in launching new products.\nMarket penetration. Volume (i.e., number of customers) and value (i.e.,\naverage deal size) are considered important. Rates of growth relative to sector\ngrowth rates are also evaluated. Also covers brand awareness, reputation and\nthe ability to leverage current market position to expand horizontally (with new\nofferings) or vertically (into new sectors).\nFinancials. Revenue growth, profitability, sustainability and financial backing\n(e.g., the ratio of license to consulting revenues) are considered key to\nscalability of the business model for risk technology vendors.\nCustomer satisfaction. Feedback from customers is evaluated, regarding\nafter-sales support and service (e.g., training and ease of implementation),\nvalue for money (e.g., price to functionality ratio) and product updates (e.g.,\nspeed and process for keeping up to date with regulatory changes).\nGrowth strategy. Recent performance is evaluated, including financial\nperformance, new product releases, quantity and quality of contract wins, and\nmarket expansion moves. Also considered are the size and quality of the sales\nforce, sales distribution channels, global presence, focus on risk management,\nmessaging and positioning. Finally, business insight and understanding, new\nthinking, formulation and execution of best practices, and intellectual rigor are\nconsidered important.\nQuadrant descriptions\nPoint solutions\nPoint solutions providers focus on a small number of component technology\ncapabilities, meeting a critical need in the risk technology market by solving\nspecific risk management problems with domain-specific software applications\nand technologies.\nThey are often strong engines for innovation, as their deep focus on a relatively\nPage 45 of 48narrow area generates thought leadership and intellectual capital.\nBy growing their enterprise functionality and utilizing integrated data\nmanagement, analytics and BI capabilities, vendors in the point solutions\ncategory can expand their completeness of offering, market potential and market\nshare.\nBest-of-breed\nBest-of-breed providers have best-in-class point solutions and the ability to\ncapture significant market share in their chosen markets.\nThey are often distinguished by a growing client base, superior sales and\nmarketing execution, and a clear strategy for sustainable, profitable growth. High\nperformers also have a demonstrable track record of R&D investment, together\nwith specific product or ‘go-to-market’ capabilities needed to deliver a competitive\nadvantage.\nFocused functionality will often see best-of-breed providers packaged together as\npart of a comprehensive enterprise risk technology architecture, co-existing with\nother solutions.\nEnterprise solutions\nEnterprise solutions providers typically offer risk management technology\nplatforms, combining functionally rich risk applications with comprehensive data\nmanagement, analytics and BI.\nA key differentiator in this category is the openness and flexibility of the\ntechnology architecture and a ‘toolkit’ approach to risk analytics and reporting,\nwhich attracts larger clients.\nEnterprise solutions are typically supported with comprehensive infrastructure\nand service capabilities, and best-in-class technology delivery. They also\ncombine risk management content, data and software to provide an integrated\n‘one-stop-shop’ for buyers.\nCategory leaders\nCategory leaders combine depth and breadth of functionality, technology and\ncontent with the required organizational characteristics to capture significant\nshare in their market.\nCategory leaders demonstrate a clear strategy for sustainable, profitable growth,\nPage 46 of 48matched with best-in-class solutions and the range and diversity of offerings,\nsector coverage and financial strength to absorb demand volatility in specific\nindustry sectors or geographic regions.\nCategory leaders will typically benefit from strong brand awareness, global reach\nand strong alliance strategies with leading consulting firms and systems\nintegrators.\nJJJJJuuuuummmmmppppp tttttooooo tttttoooooppppp\nCopyright Infopro Digital Limited.
