With April tax receipts coming\nin weaker than expected, at least so far, it appears that the X-date, when the Treasury will run out of\nthe cash needed to pay the government’s bills on time, may hit as soon as early June. House Speaker\nKevin McCarthy’s recent unveiling of proposed legislation to increase the limit is thus none too soon. In\nexchange for increasing the debt limit just enough so that it will not be a problem again until about this\ntime next year, the Speaker wants to significantly cut discretionary spending over the next decade, impose\nstricter work requirements on healthcare, food and other assistance for low-income households, and roll\nback much of the Biden’s administration’s agenda on climate change and student lending. In this note, we\nassess the macroeconomic consequences of the Speaker’s debt limit legislation.1\nThe X-date\nThe Treasury debt limit—the maximum amount of debt that the Treasury can issue to the public or to other\nfederal agencies—was hit on January 19, and since then the Treasury has been using “extraordinary mea-\nsures” to come up with the additional cash needed to pay the government’s bills. Nailing down precisely\nwhen these extraordinary measures will be exhausted, and Treasury will run out of cash and thus be unable\nto pay everyone on time—the so-called X-date—is difficult. It depends on the timing of highly uncertain tax\nreceipts and government expenditures.\nSince Moody’s Analytics began estimating the X-date early this year, we have thought it to be in mid-Au-\ngust. But April tax receipts are running 35% below last year’s pace, which is meaningfully weaker than\nanticipated. And despite weaker tax refunds than anticipated, it appears that the X-date may come as soon\nas early June. If not, and Treasury is able to squeak by with enough cash, then the X-date looks more likely\nto be in late July. That is because Treasury will get a cash infusion from non-withheld tax payments around\nthe June 15 estimated tax deadline, and then another tranche of extraordinary measures will become avail-\nable, providing Treasury with a few more weeks of cash.\nInvestors take notice\nregardless, time is running out for lawmakers to act and increase or suspend the debt limit, and global\ninvestors are suddenly focusing on the risks posed if they do not act in time. Credit default swaps on Trea-\nsury securities—the cost of buying insurance in case Treasury fails to pay its debt on time—have jumped in\nrecent weeks (see Chart 1). At close to 100 basis points, CDS spreads on six-month and one-year Treasury\n1 The Moody’s Analytics white papers “Down the Debt Limit Rabbit Hole,” and “Debt Limit Brinkmanship (Again)” provide additional relevant\nanalysis on the Treasury debt limit.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The DebT LimiT Drama heaTs Up 2securities are already substantially more than in 2011 when that debt limit drama was so unnerving it\ncaused rating agency Standard & Poor’s to strip the U.S. of its AAA rating.2\nChart 1: Debt Limit Breach Begins to Worry Investors...\nU.S. Treasury credit default swap spread by tenor, bps\n100\nGreat Financial Crisis Debt limit standoffs\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n1-yr 3-yr\nThe CDS spread on U.S. Treasury securities measures the cost of purchasing insurance to protect against a default\nSources: ICE, Moody’s Analytics on that Treasury. For example, a 100-basis point spread means it costs $100 to insure $10,000 worth of Treasuries.\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 1\nThis may overstate investors’ angst as the CDS market for buying insurance in the case of a Treasury default\nis not actively traded, and it does not take much trading to push up the cost of insurance. A few hedge\nfunds speculating on the CDS could drive up the cost since they are purchasing something akin to a lottery\nticket. Moreover, the current spread remains far from signaling that investors are attaching much of a prob-\nability on a default. For context, during the European debt crisis in 2011, the CDS spread on the sovereign\ndebt of stressed countries in the periphery of the euro zone, including Greece, topped out at 1,400 basis\npoints. Even the CDS for core euro zone countries such as Germany and France were more than 200 basis\npoints at the time.\nThat said, the runup in Treasury CDS should not be dismissed out of hand. The recent sharp decline in\none-month Treasury bill yields also signals mounting investor angst (see Chart 2). As it has become clear\nin recent days that April tax receipts were coming in weak and the X-date may be just a few weeks away,\ninvestors have piled into the safety of one-month Treasury securities. Yields have plummeted, from 4.75%\nat the start of April to less than 3.4% currently. At the same time, yields on three-month Treasury bills\nhave continued to rise. The difference between one- and three-month Treasury bill yields has never been as\nwide. Global investors thus appear to be attaching non-zero odds that the debt limit drama will end with a\ndefault sometime in June or July.\nHouse Republican proposal\nIt is thus none too soon that House Speaker McCarthy unveiled the “Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023” on\nApril 19. House republicans hope the legislation will put political pressure on president Biden to negotiate\nchanges in fiscal policy in exchange for an increase in the debt limit. The president continues to reject these\nefforts, arguing for a so-called clean debt limit increase—an increase in the debt limit without substantive\n2 A CDS spread of 100 basis points means that it costs $100 to insure $10,000 worth of Treasury securities against a default on those securities.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The DebT LimiT Drama heaTs Up 3Chart 2: …More Than a Little Bit\nU.S. Treasury yields, constant maturity, %\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n03 05 07 09 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\n3-mo Treasury bill 1-mo Treasury bill\nSources: ICE, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 2\nchanges to policy. His position is that increasing the debt limit is necessary to pay the government’s bills\nresulting from past fiscal policy decisions, over which there can be no negotiation.3\nSpeaker McCarthy’s proposed legislation would increase the debt limit by $1.5 trillion or until March 31,\n2024, whichever comes first. In exchange, it would cut government spending by $4.5 trillion over the next\ndecade and implement a number of consequential changes to fiscal policy (see Table 1 and Chart 3). The\nmost significant spending cuts would come by setting fiscal 2024 discretionary spending equal to fiscal\nChart 3: Budgetary Consequences of the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023\nStatic budget deficit effect, % of GDP, fiscal yr\n0.4\n0.0\n-0.4\n-0.8\n-1.2\n-1.6\n-2.0\n-2.4\n24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33\nCut discretionary spending Repeal green energy tax credits End student loan policies\nRescind unspent COVID-19 funds Increase work requirements Pass Lower Energy Costs Act\nClaw back IRS funding Net effect\nSources: CBO, CRFB, JCT, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 3\n3 Those past policy decisions resulting in budget deficits and more government debt are bipartisan. Both republicans and Democrats supported\nthe close to $3 trillion in deficit-financed fiscal aid provided to the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic under president Trump in 2020.\nAnd while only Democrats supported the almost $2 trillion deficit-financed American Rescue Plan passed early in the Biden administration to\nhelp with the fallout from the pandemic in 2021, only republicans supported the nearly $2 trillion deficit-financed Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed\nearly in the Trump administration that cut corporate and personal income taxes.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The DebT LimiT Drama heaTs Up 4Table 1: Budgetary Consequences of the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023\nEffect on cumulative budget deficits from fiscal 2024 to 2033, $ bil\nReduce discretionary budget authority to fiscal 2022 level and limit growth to 1% per annum over the next decade -3,165\nBlock student loan forgiveness of up to $20,000 per borrower and revamped Income-Driven Repayment plan -465\nRepeal clean energy tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act -350\nIncrease work requirements in TANF, SNAP and Medicaid -120\nRescind unexpired unobligated balances under COVID-19 relief funding -60\nEnact H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act 0\nClaw back IRS funding for enforcement, taxpayer services and operations 114\nInterest savings -510\nTotal -4,556\nSources: CBO, CRFB, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, JCT, Moody’s Analytics\n2022 spending levels. Annual spending growth would then be capped at 1% for the next decade. While not\nstipulated in the legislation, republicans would likely work to exclude discretionary spending on defense\nand veterans’ benefits from the cuts, putting the burden of the cuts on nondefense, non-VA discretionary\nprograms.4 If nondefense discretionary outlays were to bear the full brunt of the proposed budget cuts, they\nwould fall to 2% of GDp by fiscal 2033, the lowest since at least the early 1960s (see Chart 4).\nChart 4: What if the Nondefense Discretionary Budget Bears the Full Brunt?\nNondefense discretionary outlays, % of GDP, fiscal yr\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32\nHistory Current law Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 Historical avg since 1962\nSources: BEA, CBO, CRFB, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 4\nThe Speaker’s debt limit legislation also works to roll back a number of president Biden’s policy initiatives.\nOn energy policy, the legislation would focus on increasing fossil fuel supplies through the enactment of\nHouse Republicans’ energy package, which aims to boost oil and gas production and mining by cutting\ndown on the time it takes to greenlight energy projects. It would also end tax breaks for clean-energy proj-\nects and qualifying electric vehicles included in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n4 Discretionary spending comprises outlays that lawmakers control through annual appropriation acts. Nondefense, non-VA discretionary spend-\ning includes a wide range of government programs, ranging from spending on affordable housing assistance and air traffic control to NASA and\njob training, to name a few.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The DebT LimiT Drama heaTs Up 5On student lending, the legislation would prevent a couple of key executive orders by the Biden administra-\ntion, including the White House’s plan to provide up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness for some bor-\nrowers. That hit a roadblock last year when it was met with several legal challenges, and the Supreme Court\nis expected to decide its fate later this year. An income-driven repayment plan rolled out by the Education\nDepartment earlier this year is also in the crosshairs.\nThe Speaker’s legislation also imposes restrictions on income support programs, including work require-\nments on Medicaid recipients who do not have children, an increase in the age limit for work rules under\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance program (food assistance), and a requirement that states report on\nwork outcomes under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. It eliminates much of the\nadditional funding provided to the IrS last year to help increase tax enforcement efforts and improve tax-\npayer services, and it rescinds unspent COVID-19 relief funds. And the legislation would also require con-\ngressional approval before major regulations could take effect.\nMacroeconomic impacts\nThe Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 would cut into near-term economic growth if passed into law. Compared\nwith a scenario that includes a clean debt limit increase and no other significant changes to fiscal policy\nunder current law, real GDp in the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2024 would be 0.65 percentage\npoint lower (see Table 2).5 That is, in the Clean Debt Limit scenario, real GDp is expected to grow 2.25% in\nthe year compared with 1.6% if Speaker McCarthy’s legislation becomes law.\nWhile the economy skirts recession in both scenarios, recession risks are uncomfortably high, with a con-\nsensus of economists and many investors and business executives expecting a downturn beginning late\nthis year or early next. The timing of the government spending cuts in the Limit, Save, Grow Act is thus\nespecially inopportune as it would meaningfully increase the likelihood of such a downturn. Indeed, under\nthe legislation, GDp growth is so weak that employment declines in the first three quarter of 2024, and the\nunemployment rate rises by more than a percentage point to 4.6% by the fourth quarter of 2024. Com-\npared with the Clean Debt Limit scenario, by year-end 2024, employment is 780,000 jobs lower, and the\nunemployment rate is 0.36 percentage point higher.\nThe significant government spending cuts in the Limit, Save, Grow Act are substantial headwinds to near-\nterm economic growth. The cuts reduce nondefense outlays by $120 billion in fiscal 2024 compared with\nthe Clean Debt Limit scenario, equal to about half a percentage point of GDp. The multipliers on this spend-\ning—the change in GDp a year after a change in spending—are estimated to be just over 1, as the programs\nsuffering budget cuts are essential government services and tend to benefit lower-income households that\nquickly spend any support they receive from the government. Adding to the economic headwinds created\nby the legislation is the considerable uncertainty created by having to address the debt limit again a year\nfrom now. Given that 2024 is a presidential election year, that future debt limit drama may well be even\nmore heated than the current one. This is sure to weigh on investor, business and consumer confidence and\nthus economic activity.\n5 The Clean Debt Limit scenario assumes that the moratorium on student loan payments ends this summer, but that president Biden’s student\ndebt forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans remain in place. This scenario also assumes lawmakers agree to increase the debt limit just\nenough to ensure that it will not get caught up in the 2024 presidential election.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The DebT LimiT Drama heaTs Up 6Table 2: Macroeconomic Impact of Speaker McCarthy’s Debt Limit Plan\nAvg.

The\nFederal reserve begins to lower interest rates late this year soon after the passage of the legislation given\nthe weaker economic growth and heightened recession risks. Long-term Treasury yields are also lower in\npart because of the weaker economy but also because of prospects for smaller long-term budget deficits\nand a lower government debt load. A decade from now, the nation’s debt-to-GDp ratio is expected to be\n106%. This is up from 97% in fiscal 2022, but below the 116% debt-to-GDp ratio expected in the Clean\nDebt Limit scenario for the end of the 10-year budget horizon. GDp and jobs are lower, and unemployment\na bit higher a decade from now under the Limit, Save, Grow Act than in the Clean Debt Limit scenario.\nThough the nation’s fiscal situation is better, Speaker McCarthy’s legislation does not propose reforms to\nold-age entitlement programs, which, if left unaddressed, will keep the federal budget on an unsustainable\ntrajectory in the long run (see Chart 5).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The DebT LimiT Drama heaTs Up 7Chart 5: Deficit Reduction Should Not Solely Target Discretionary Outlays\nFederal outlays, % of GDP, fiscal yr\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32\nSocial Security Medicare Medicaid Net interest Defense Nondefense\nNote: Dotted lines reflect CBO’s projections of mandatory\nSources: BEA, CBO, Moody’s Analytics and discretionary spending under current law.\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 5\nWhat’s next\nThe Treasury debt limit drama is heating up and is sure to get much hotter in coming weeks as we get\na better fix on April tax receipts and the actual X-date. If the X-date is as soon as early June, it seems a\nstretch for lawmakers to come to terms fast enough, and they instead will likely decide to pass legislation\nsuspending the limit long enough to line the X-date up with the end of fiscal 2023 at the end of Septem-\nber. This will buy some time and combine the debt limit decision with the federal government’s fiscal 2024\nbudget, which is also must-do legislation for lawmakers to ensure the government is funded and avoids a\nshutdown.6\nGetting legislation that funds the government in fiscal 2024 and increases the debt limit across the finish\nline into law will surely be messy and painful to watch, generating significant volatility in financial markets.\nIndeed, a stock market selloff, much wider credit spreads in the corporate bond market, and a falling value\nof the U.S. dollar may be what is required to generate the political will necessary for lawmakers to avoid a\ngovernment shutdown and breach of the debt limit. Lawmakers will not be sufficiently motivated to find a\npolitical path forward and act until they recognize the severe economic and political costs of not doing so.\nBut when all is said and done, the legislation that lawmakers ultimately pass will likely be anticlimactic,\nallowing both House republicans and president Biden to declare political victory. For House republicans,\nthe legislation may include some restraint on the future growth in discretionary spending, a clawback\nof unused COVID-19 relief funds, and a streamlining of permits for energy development to allow House\nrepublicans to declare victory. For the president, he can argue that these concessions were modest and\nsimply part of the typical budget process and not a quid pro quo for a debt limit increase: a happy enough\noutcome to ensure the government is funded and the economy avoids financial calamity and recession. Of\ncourse, the nation’s daunting long-term fiscal challenges remain.\n6 To assure maximum political pressure to get this all done by the start of October, the legislation that suspends the limit could require the\nTreasury to have the same cash balance at the end of fiscal 2023 as it had at the start of the suspension when the cash balance was virtually ex-\nhausted. The legislation could also prevent the Treasury from targeting the G Fund of Federal Employees’ retirement System Thrift Savings plan,\nwhich normally provides the Treasury significant headroom under the debt limit.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The DebT LimiT Drama heaTs Up 8About the Authors\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
