Leaders of these organizations have seized\nthe opportunity to create or re-invigorate their enterprise’s risk\nculture and strengthen the understanding of credit risk among their\nprofessionals. They have also focused attention on proper processes\nand procedures, which, when followed, can improve loan quality\nand recoveries. This paper describes the “best practices” observed\nby Moody’s Analytics that have been most effective in creating and\nsustaining a strong credit risk culture. It also seeks to explain why\nthese specific practices contribute to success.\nFor decades, management leaders have extolled the importance\nof a strong and positive “corporate culture.” A positive credit\nrisk culture in a financial institution might be described as: “An\nenvironment of shared values and beliefs about an organization’s\napproach to credit risk in which people behave according to\naccepted standards and principles when evaluating and discussing\nlending decisions.” Leaders who seek to establish a strong credit risk\nculture have two challenges: first, creating the desired culture, and\nsecond, sustaining it. The most successful credit risk organizations\ncombine four key elements: (1) leadership; (2) organizational\nstructure; (3) policies, procedures and processes; and (4) people.\nIt is noteworthy that the most enlightened leaders seem to\nunderstand that, although structure, policies and protocols are\nimportant, the performance of people is what ultimately drives\nand sustains a strong credit risk culture. This whitepaper discusses\neach of these critical aspects along with corresponding case studies\nbased on customer experiences.\nBUILDING A STRONG CREDIT CULTURE 1LEADERSHIP\nThe importance of exemplary leadership in creating and maintaining a robust credit culture cannot be\noverestimated. Institutions that embody such cultures are generally led by managers who openly embrace\na core set of values about how credit risk is managed. The following examples illustrate the effect of senior\nmanagement’s actions on an organization’s credit culture.\nThe CEO of a large bank clearly articulates the vision, Senior executives of another large bank collectively\nvalues and beliefs that guide that institution’s lending communicated the importance of balancing growth\nactivities.

Institutions that lack a strong credit culture often make most credit decisions at or near the\ntop of the organization. When vision and values are not effectively translated into practice by all levels\nin the organization, the staff tends to lack confidence in credit judgment and risk management, resulting\nin responsibility for these decisions “falling up” to senior levels.
