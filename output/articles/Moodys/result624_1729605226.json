    "content": "Client Spotlight: Insular Life Assurance Company\nBackground\nThe Insular Life (InLife) Assurance Company, Ltd. was established on November 25, 1910 in Manila. It is the first and largest Filipino\nlife insurance company and the only mutual life insurance company in the Philippines. InLife celebrates its 110th anniversary in 2020.\nThe company offers an array of individual life insurance products, both traditional and unit-linked. They also offer group insurance\nproducts covering employees of several clients.\nThe Requirements\nThe IFRS 17 accounting standard represents a notable change for insurers in more than 100 countries across the globe. IFRS 17\ncreates significant changes to the reporting, data, and accounting systems across an insurer’s organization—so selecting and\nimplementing the right tools to deal with these changes is critical. The local regulator in the Philippines, the Insurance Commission,\nhas stated that the implementation of IFRS 17 for life and non-life insurance industries has been deferred by two years to 2025 after\ninternational adoption.\nWhile preparing to meet the requirements of this new and continually evolving accounting standard, InLife launched their vendor\nselection for the development of their IFRS 17 system. The team was in search of a vendor not only to collaborate with, but one that\nalso offered the necessary tools to support their IFRS 17 requirements.\nThe main InLife requirements for the solution were:\n» A reputable solution vendor: reliable, with a strong support and customer services team\n» Flexibility: a solution that did not require changing their pre-existing actuarial software and accounting system\n» Security: a stable and secured infrastructure\n» Effective deployment methodology: a deployment method that was in line with and would complement the existing method used\ninternally for bigger projects\nThe Solution\nThe selection of the RiskIntegrity™ for IFRS 17 solution by Insular Life was a result of “Standing out against InLife’s evaluation criteria,”\nsays Jesselyn Ocampo, FVP & Chief Actuary. The flexibility of the solution was another key factor. “I am also echoing the positive\nreviews of the overall lead of our IFRS17 project,” Maria Edita Elicano, EVP and Head of the Administrative Operations Group. “We\ndidn’t need to change our actuarial software or accounting system. During the POC stage, we saw that Moody’s Analytics IFRS 17\nteam aligned perfectly with how we wanted to run our IFRS 17 implementation project.”\nA global vendor with local delivery\nMoody’s Analytics offers InLife an award-winning solution and access to our global team of insurance specialists. The team is made\nup of researchers, actuaries, accountants, and quantitative analysts who continually scrutinize the IFRS 17 standard and industry\ndiscourse to design a solution that is able to accommodate various interpretations of the standard. The team is complemented by the\nlocal delivery team, which assists, advises, and resolves customer issues. The team are experts in the field and were able to help the\nIFRS 17 project team at InLife understand how the standards are applied in the RiskIntegrity for IFRS 17 solution.The software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution driving project momentum\nThe RiskIntegrity for IFRS 17 solution is delivered as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) that integrates with InLife’s existing infrastructure,\nconnecting data, models, systems, and processes between actuarial and finance functions. As a SaaS solution, it has the highest\nsecurity standards and enables Moody’s Analytics to deliver continuous regulatory updates, quick deployment, and support. The SaaS-\nenabled solution has been recognized as one of the contributing success factors that enabled the project to move forward and not\nlose momentum, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDe-risking a project with an award-winning configured solution\nThe IT, Business Transformation, Finance, and Actuarial teams at InLife were already involved in various projects geared toward making\nthe insurer the most digitally connected insurance company. Hence, building an in-house solution to meet the IFRS 17 requirements\nwas not an option. The team at InLife opted to implement the best solution available, to allow the team to focus on aligning the\ncompany’s data and processes to the new reporting requirement. InLife also applied the native data management features of the\nRiskIntegrity for IFRS 17 solution.\nThe Implementation Journey\nThe Moody’s Analytics and InLife project team followed an agile methodology for IFRS 17 implementation. As the team ventured on\nthe implementation journey, the biggest challenges identified and addressed were:\n» Preparing data in the granularity needed for IFRS 17\n» Interpreting the standard for all three methodologies PAA, GMM, and VFA\n» Aligning existing processes to those required by IFRS 17\nThe InLife team is currently running parallel tests with system and process flow enhancements. The granularity of data has been set\nup and processes aligned. The driving factors that helped InLife reach this stage of implementation efficiently and quickly was the\nupgrade of the major administration system. This allowed data granularity and the adoption of an agile methodology for deployment.\nThe agile methodology of implementation helped the team achieve the key milestones set on the project roadmap and enabled\nimmediate problem resolution.\nAs parallel tests continue, the teams at InLife learn more about emerging developments of IFRS 17, with continued support on\ninterpreting the standard from the Moody’s Analytics team. Testing will be done in tandem with the rollout of updated versions of the\nRiskIntegrity for IFRS 17 solution.\nThe IASB® delay gives the team more time to refine the implementation as the final wording of the standard is interpreted, with some\nprovisions still incomplete or unclear. The additional time will also be used to finalize and run simulations to better understand the\nimpact on financials, and to address issues that arise.\nTo learn more about Moody’s Analytics RiskIntegrity™ for IFRS 17, request a demo today or contact Moody’s Client Services & Support.\nAmericas Client Desk Europe Sales Queries Asia Client Services Desk Japan Client Services Desk\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices@moodys.com clientservices@moodys.com clientservices@moodys.com\n© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or\ntheir licensors and affi liates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
