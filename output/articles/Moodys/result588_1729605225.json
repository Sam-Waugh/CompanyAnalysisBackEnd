One of the tools\ninsurers use to assess the potential impacts of risks and investigate different optimization\nAuthor\nstrategies is the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). While the regulatory capital\nCassandra Hannibal, FIA, CERA\nDirector --- Insurance Research requirement may be determined by a metric over a shorter time period (For example a one\nyear risk measure) the ORSA is often broader, spanning governance and risk management\nContact Us\npractices and looking further into the future.

They consider more than just value for money when choosing an insurer or pension company and a product.\nUltimately, they are voting with their feet.\n» Analysts and investors have always considered how effective managing is at seizing opportunities and managing risks for\nprofit. Climate-related risks are potentially significant.\n» Rating agencies are incorporating the management of climate-related risks along with wider ESG considerations into their\ncredit rating as it impacts the ability of an insurer to repay debts.\n» Regulators are concerned with stability of the market and the protection of customers and want evidence that the risks and\nopportunities are being appropriately identified and managed.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE AWARE ORSA 3Why ORSA\nAlthough a risk assessment is carried out to calculate the regulatory capital requirement, the ORSA is much broader. It spans all\nrisks, not just those mitigated by capital and broader risk management activities. It also looks beyond the downside risks to\nconsider the opportunities (upside risks) and actions required to realize them. The insurer chooses the assumptions and\nmethodologies most appropriate to their business, although in many cases the ORSA is reviewed by the regulator so the choice is\nnot unrestricted. Typically, the exercise is carried out annually although many of the components are carried out more frequently.\nThe ORSA can require several iterations as different combinations of scenarios (external factors) and strategies (insurer-driven\nactions) are investigated. The output of the exercise is typically a report presented to the board, and after it is approved, shared\nwith the regulator. The report may contain and/ or refer to some or all the following items:\n» Description of key risk policies (including risk appetites, limits, and other metrics)\n» Description of key risk processes (includes roles, responsibilities, and key output)\n» Evidence the policies and processes are working effectively\n» Methodology, key assumptions, and parameters for calculations (including sensitivities)\n» Reconciliation of key metrics to other published reporting bases\n» Rationale for and narrative of scenarios considered\n» Projected results under various scenarios (can be broken down by region, portfolio, and so on)\n» Mitigating actions and management responses (currently available and future alternatives)\n» Next steps\nThe report is used to determine follow-up investigations, actions, and strategies that can impact all areas of the business such as\npricing, product features, reinsurance, capital requirements, investment choices, and others.\nIncorporating climate change risk into the ORSA is much more than just updating a single report. As can be seen from the ORSA\ncontents in the bullet point list above, the ORSA relies on many other policies and processes that will need to be reviewed for\nclimate change impacts.\nRisk policies and processes\nMost insurers are already managing their risks with risk appetites, risk limits, defined roles, responsibilities, key metrics and so on.\nThe policies and processes typically cover the main market risks, demographic risks, and operational risks to which the insurer is\nexposed. Many insurers have already started reviewing and updating these for climate risks. For example, physical risks can impact\nthe incidence of demographic risks so any key risk indicators may need to change to work effectively as early warning signals.\nChanges may be required to the investment risk policy to allow the insurer to make changes to the investment strategy for\nclimate-priced assets. Some insurers have also created a separate climate-change risk policy. After these policies and processes are\nin place, they need to be regularly tested to assess whether they are working effectively and what improvements are required.\nResults generation\nBoth regulators and industry bodies have issued guidance on financial disclosures, for example the Taskforce for Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD)1. These include testing the resilience of your strategy under different scenarios (including 2oC or\nlower), disclosing the metrics used to assess climate-related risks and the performance against targets. While these relate to public\ndisclosures the principles can be applied to private results and expanded further in the ORSA. Results generation is discussed more\nin the next section.\n1 Recommendations from the TCFD, TCFD, June 2017\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE AWARE ORSA 4Mitigating actions and management responses\nMany insurers are being proactive in managing climate-related risks and have already increased their access to mitigation options\nand management actions. For example, some insurers have already reviewed their investment strategy and made changes –\ndisinvesting from some dirty asset classes and increasing investment in clean asset classes. Some insurers have already changed\nproduct terms, included new options or developed new climate-friendly products. The financial implications of these actions are\ninvestigated before the actions are approved. Some insurers are preparing for the materialization of specific transition risks by\ninvestigating potential responses.\nWhat is happening\nMost risks involve uncertainty, however the speed of changes, the compound nature of physical risks, the irregular nature of\ntransition risks and the interactions between the two exacerbate the uncertainty over the impact of climate-related risks.\nIncorporating climate change risks into the ORSA results is a good first place to start investigating the impacts, mitigations, and\nactions. There are many challenges to address in order to produce the ORSA results, for example:\n» Which scenarios – which combinations of physical and transition risks, similar or extreme scenarios, which scenario is the\n‘baseline’, how many scenarios.\n» How to translate scenarios into model inputs – economic and non-economic variables, correlations and consistency.\n» How to model over long time horizon – whether to include new business or run-off, how to roll over assets, deterministic or\nstochastic on stochastic valuation.\n» What level of granularity – is data available for entity or sector level parameters, annual or x-yearly time steps, portfolio or\ncompany level results.\n» Which outputs to produce – whether to model both assets and liabilities, capital measures, key risk indicators, key\nprofit/performance measures, fund-specific measures, climate-specific measures.\nClimate-related ORSA results challenges\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CLIMATE AWARE ORSA 5Some insurers have already started making changes to try to address some of these challenges and have been encouraged by\nregulators. For example, European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA) released its guidance to supervisors on\nthe use of climate change scenarios in ORSA2 which included some guidance on the following:\n» Definition of climate change risk\n» Integration of climate change risks in ORSA in the short and long term\n» Materiality assessment of climate change risks\n» Range of climate change risk scenarios\n» Modeling transition and physical impacts at granular level\n» Lower precision and frequency of long-term scenario analyses\n» Evolution of climate change risks analyses\n» Supervisory reporting and consistent disclosure\n» Reporting requirements\n» Monitoring by EIOPA\nThe changes to the ORSA for the inclusion of climate change risks aim to help insurers to make more informed decisions across\nthe business. However, there are many challenges to incorporate climate-related risks into the ORSA to output results and metrics\nthat are useful for investigating alternative strategies, mitigating actions and decision-making. Insurers are using combinations of\nin-house expertise, industry data, and industry/consultancy models to start to overcome these challenges. Best practice will\nemerge as insurers, regulators, and other stakeholders learn from their ORSA experiences.\nThis is part of a series of papers on climate risk topics for insurers.
