    "content": "Time To Protect Your Corporation From Counterparty LossIntroduction\nTraditionally, credit risk management has not been a core activity at companies outside of the banking and fi nancial services sector. The\nimplications of not regularly managing and measuring credit risk can be substantial and potentially lead to bad debt exposure, supply chain\ndisruptions, reputational risk, and hefty legal fees incurred enforcing customer contracts. The good news is that there are several practices that\ncredit managers, CFOs, and treasurers can adopt to avoid such costly mistakes and make more conscious business decisions.\nThe objective of this article is to:\n» Outline best practices in credit and counterparty risk management for corporate CFOs, treasurers, and credit managers\n» Highlight the principles of effective credit and counterparty risk management\n» Explain the benefi ts of rigorous credit and counterparty risk management\nWhy is credit and counterparty risk management important?\nHistorically, credit management at corporations has focused largely on customer risk from new and existing customers.\nTraditionally, analysis done in credit departments has centered on the question: “If we extend credit (or lease terms) to this customer, will they\npay us back?” After all, depending on the industry and type of exposure, if one of the largest customers goes bankrupt, their supplier could\neasily follow suit. However, a prudent corporation should consider risks coming from a wider range of counterparties beyond their customers.\nTypes of counterparties in the credit and counterparty risk analysis\nCUSTOMERS\nSUPPLIERS\nDISTRIBUTORS\nCORPORATES\nBANKS STRATEGIC PARTNERS\nTRADING COUNTERPARTIES\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS TIME TO PROTECT YOUR CORPORATION FROM COUNTERPARTY LOSS 2How to Protect Your Corporation From Counterparty Loss\n» Access to private/public fi nancial data\nEVALUATE POTENTIAL\n» Data in a standardized format and centralized location\nCOUNTERPARTY\n» Automate and defi ne calculations of fi nancial ratios\n» Industry and peer insight\nPERFORM PEER\nANALYSIS » Determine peer group\nAaa\n» Standardized credit scoring system\nDETERMINE CREDIT SCORE\n» Validate Internal models\nSET CREDIT LIMITS AND » Establish framework for translating credit scores into\nTERMS credit terms\n» Identify early warning signals\n» Establish an effective risk monitoring system\nAaa MONITOR EXPOSURES\n» Conduct scenario analysis for adverse circumstances\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS TIME TO PROTECT YOUR CORPORATION FROM COUNTERPARTY LOSS 3How to Protect Your Corporation From Counterparty Loss\n1. EVALUATE POTENTIAL COUNTERPARTY\nGenerally speaking, it is good practice to evaluate the financial strength of a new counterparty before\nentering into a business relationship. However, financial data from suppliers, customers, distributors,\nor banking counterparties is often not captured, or captured in different formats by analysts across the\ncompany, which makes comprehensive analyses and credit risk reporting difficult. This information\nshould be captured, documented, and archived in accordance with a company’s credit policies across geographies\nand departments, using standardized data entry templates that can be easily accessed and implemented across the\ncompany. To address any gaps in data on counterparties, a third-party vendor can be employed to provide financial\nstatements on firms where the company is missing data.\nStoring and gathering financial data is critical when evaluating financial statements of a given counterparty. A wide\nrange of ratios can be calculated for a given business, but liquidity and solvency measures are the most important\nfrom the perspective of managing credit risk. Liquidity analysis aims to determine whether the company has enough\nliquidity to meet its short-term obligations. For example, the current ratio (current assets / current liabilities)\nmeasures a company’s ability to cover its short-term obligations with current assets on hand. Solvency analysis\naims to establish whether the company is financed correctly so that it can recover from a loss or a period of losses.\nA typical technique to analyze insolvency risk is to focus on ratios such as the leverage ratio, which compares a\ncompany’s total debt to its total equity amount.\n2. PERFORM PEER ANALYSIS\nPeer analysis allows corporations to make more informed decisions by comparing credit risk\ninformation and financial ratios for a specific customer, distributor, or supplier against a group of their\npeers. Peer groups should be defined by industry, region, or company size. After a peer is selected and\nfinancial information is provided, an analysis should outline credit risk trends for the company and its\npeers. Since accumulating peer credit risk data can take years and tremendous effort, using a third-party database\nwith financial information already available can save valuable time.\n3. DETERMINE CREDIT SCORE\nAaa To derive a score or other metric to measure credit worthiness, implementing quantitative probability\nof default (PD) credit measures result in the most accurate credit risk assessments. This metric should\nthen be mapped to an internal credit score. We recommend implementing internal credit scorecards\nthat incorporate quantitative and qualitative factors. If corporations choose to develop their own\npredictive scoring models, it is imperative to use validated third-party models as an input to their own model or\nas benchmarks to ensure accuracy. Corporations should also go one step further and ensure that the same scoring\nsystem and framework are being used across divisions and geographies to ensure consistency across the entire\norganization.\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS TIME TO PROTECT YOUR CORPORATION FROM COUNTERPARTY LOSS 4How to Protect Your Corporation From Counterparty Loss\n4. SET CREDIT LIMITS AND TERMS\nCompanies can have hundreds — if not thousands — of exposures in the form of credit extended to\ncustomers and distributors. These exposures must be consolidated and monitored, both when the\nexposure is originated (that is when a new customer signs a financing agreement or a new contract is\nsigned with a supplier), and over time. Like a commercial bank, a corporation must manage its entire\nportfolio of loans. Each new exposure should be compared against pre-defined limits for counterparties, industry\nsectors, countries, or product type before a risk decision is made. In addition to diligent financial analysis, a prudent\ncredit manager also examines qualitative factors, such as a company’s competitive positioning, its history, and\nreputation in the market. By implementing a limits monitoring system, alerts are sent when limits are breached –\nparticularly when extending more credit to a watch-list customer or distributor beyond the pre-defined limit.\n5. MONITOR EXPOSURES\nFor a comprehensive and more relevant view of risk across an organization, it is best practice to\nconsolidate exposures worldwide, across subsidiaries and business units, using limits management\nAaa\nsoftware tied to the credit analysis and origination system. Implementing a company-wide\nmonitoring system enables a company’s risk management function to push limits and review policies\ndown to the business unit level. Having such a system in place enables a company to manage credit risk exposures\nactively. Early identification of potential defaults allows a credit manager to act to avoid disastrous situations.\nEffective credit management also means being prepared for adverse outcomes. Good credit managers should do\nregular and rigorous scenario analysis on their credit exposures and include both macro and industry-specific shocks\nin the exercise. The key to effective stress testing is creating appropriate scenarios and ensuring the underlying\nanalytics are meaningful. By using a third-party tool that adjusts default probabilities based on public equity prices,\nyou gain a forward looking indicator to your analysis.\nWhy Must Companies Establish Comprehensive Credit Policies?\nCompanies must ensure that everyone involved in their credit assessment practice follows the same process. Many\ncorporate credit departments are severely understaffed, and a change in culture within an organization is necessary\nto be able to make efficient and effective decisions regarding credit risk exposure. An actionable credit policy,\ndetermined by top executives, provides decision-makers with tangible guidelines when difficult credit decisions\nor issues present themselves. Components of a credit policy can include important decisions such as limits and\nconcentration appetite, authorization levels and approval roles, contingency planning, and governance.\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS TIME TO PROTECT YOUR CORPORATION FROM COUNTERPARTY LOSS 5Benefits and Conclusion\nBenefits of Rigorous Credit and Counterparty Risk Management?\nIf a company rigorously follows best practices in credit and counterparty risk management, it can achieve certain\nadvantages, including:\n» Unifying the credit assessment practice by implementing repeatable processes and standardizing outputs\n» Qualifying new customers quickly, reducing response time, and improving customer satisfaction\n» Developing a more balanced portfolio of counterparties to withstand any downturns\n» Receiving early warning signals necessary for proactive exposure management\n» Minimizing costs in both bad debt expense & legal expenses incurred to enforce contracts\n» Protecting your company’s assets that are on lease or credit terms to customers\nConclusion\nFor corporations, the decision to implement robust credit risk frameworks and processes is not an option - it is an\nimperative to building a strong & sustainable business. Depending on the size of the corporation, the credit and\ncounterparty risk management process can be quite sophisticated. However, all firms must take the basic steps of\nstandardizing the way financial data is collected and analyzed, implementing credit limits, introducing monitoring\ncapabilities, and implementing workflows and corporate credit policies. With sound credit practices, a company\nreceives early warning signals on bad credits, improves customer service and, above all, makes better decisions to\nkeep the business running smoothly. As such, the credit and counterparty risk management process at corporations\nshould be viewed as a high strategic priority.\nMoody’s Analytics Counterparty Credit Risk Solutions\nMoody’s Analytics proprietary research, ratings, and software solutions allow corporate treasurers and risk managers\nto collect financial data and measure probability of default (PD) for sovereigns, publicly listed entities, and privately\nheld companies around the world.
