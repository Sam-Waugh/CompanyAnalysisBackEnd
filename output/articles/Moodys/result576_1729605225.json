This\nmay require insurers to develop or adjust existing methodologies to capture data\nand model the impacts of climate and other sustainability risks on their financial\nperformance. The new requirements are likely to result not only in changes to\nreporting processes and systems, but also to the way companies manage\nsustainability-related risks and incorporate them in their broader risk\nmanagement strategy and decision-making processes.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS ON INSURERS 1Table of Contents\nA board is born 3\nNew reporting requirements on the horizon 3\nImpacts on the insurance industry’s reporting 4\nData, systems, and processes 4\nReporting timelines 5\nWhere and when will the new standards apply 5\nWhat should insurers be doing now? 6\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS ON INSURERS 2A board is born\nUntil now, the IFRS Foundation was known as an oversight body of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) who\nissue International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These standards have been broadly adopted by wide number of\ncountries around the world as a basis for financial reporting of mostly public companies. The new ISSB will sit alongside the\nIASB, issuing independently new type of standards focused on sustainability-related financial information. The ambition of the\nISSB is to create a reporting framework that will achieve similar international recognition to IFRS, becoming a globally\nconsistent set of compulsory reporting rules.\nThe ISSB acknowledges the efforts to date of various organizations and bodies to provide guidelines and best practices on\nsustainability-related reporting. It will build on this legacy by incorporating into its standards existing frameworks such as the\nrecommendation of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). It is a well-\nknown framework and many countries, including the G7 members, New Zealand, Switzerland, and China, which have already\ncommitted to implement it in the coming years for their large companies. Currently, many companies around the world use it\non a voluntary basis for climate risk reporting. The ISSB standards will also incorporate the work of the Climate Disclosure\nStandards Board (CDSB) and the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF). These two organizations will merge with the ISSB next\nyear which is an important step in unifying different sustainability reporting recommendations by bringing them under one\nroof.\nGiven the urgency to create a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability-related disclosures, the ability to build on\nexisting disclosure frameworks rather than starting from scratch is a much-needed accelerator. The first step has been the\nwork of the Technical Readiness Working Group (TRWG) consisting of representatives of many international organizations and\nglobal financial regulatory bodies. They have utilized existing frameworks and guidelines to prepare prototypes of the first two\nstandards. These were published on the ISSB website on the same day the formation of the new Board was announced. It is\nexpected that these prototypes will become the basis of exposure drafts prepared by the ISSB when it starts operating next\nyear.\nOn March 31, 2022 the ISSB issued exposure drafts of their first two IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, based on the\nearlier prototypes and incorporating frameworks of TCFD, CDSB and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). The\nexposure drafts are based on and reconfirm the requirements set out in the initial prototypes discussed below. Stakeholders\nare invited to provide their comments on the exposure drafts, with deadline of July 29, 2022. By this date the ISSB is planning\nto quorate, recruit enough members, to be able to start their deliberations in line with the IFRS Foundation due process. The\nISSB has stated their intention to finalize work on both standards by the end of 2022, but their effective dates have not been\ndecided yet and are subject to public comment.\nNew reporting requirements on the horizon\nThe first of the prototypes sets the basis for the future General Requirements for Disclosure on Sustainability-related Financial\nInformation. The aim of this disclosure will be to provide the users of general-purpose financial reporting (i.e. investors,\nlenders, and other creditors) with sustainability-related information required to assess the enterprise value of the reporting\ncompany in order to make investment decisions.\nThe second prototype deals specifically with one sub-set of sustainability-related disclosures, which is an exposure to climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities. It focuses on the impacts of such risks and opportunities on financial information such as the\namount, timing and uncertainty of future short, medium, and long-term cash flows. Climate risks are distinguished by two\ncategories that may be familiar to those already reporting under on TCFD recommendations:\n» Physical risks due to climate change and its effects such as floods or droughts, which can result in financial implications;\nand\n» Transition risks, such as costs of adaptation `to climate change and new regulations.\nBoth prototype standards leverage the structure of the TCFD reporting framework, building risk and opportunity focused\ndisclosure requirements around four areas:\n» Governance including processes, controls, and procedures to monitor and manage the climate and other sustainability-\nrelated risks\n» Strategy for addressing these risks including a description of the current and anticipated impact on their business model,\ndecision-making, financial position, and financial performance. The required disclosures also include projections of\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS ON INSURERS 3changes of these impacts over time, and an analysis of the resilience of the entity’s strategy and cash flows to significant\nrisks\n» Risk management, i.e. how existing and emerging risks are identified, assessed, managed, and mitigated\n» Metrics and Targets to measure and monitor risks, including cross-industry and industry-based metrics, activity metrics\nand other KPIs. Companies will have to report on targets to mitigate risks or enhance opportunities, performance against\nthese targets, and how progress is being measured.\nImpacts on the insurance industry’s reporting\nMany insurers have already put a lot of effort into voluntarily incorporating climate and other sustainability-related disclosures\nin their reporting, following the TCFD’s recommendations and other globally acknowledged guidelines. For such insurers, the\nprospect of new ISSB standards and their implementation by local governments equates to just a legal endorsement of\nestablished disclosure practices. However, in practice, the level of compliance with current voluntary guidelines varies across\ncompanies in terms of both the scope and the quality of disclosed information. Some areas of future compulsory disclosures\nof many insurers may require changes not only to reporting data, systems, and processes, but also to the way they manage\nclimate and other sustainability-related risks and include them in the overall governance and strategy of the organization. If\nregulators require sustainability-related disclosures to be audited, it may increase the level of controls and scrutiny around\ntheir reporting process.\nAdding a new set of disclosure requirements to the existing IFRS standards will not only create the need for developing new\nreporting practices, but it may also impact those related to existing financial reporting. Information required by the ISSB\nstandards will become part of general-purpose financial reporting, prepared with the same users in mind and using a similar\nconcept of materiality. All disclosure information should be connected and consistent, allowing end users to understand the\ninteractions and dependencies between sustainability-related financial disclosures and other information in the general-\npurpose financial reporting. Making a link between sustainability-related disclosures and financial projections will become\nnecessary when preparing financial statements based on IFRS (or even based on local GAAP, if governments decide to\nsupplement these requirements with the ISSB standards). Preparation of the new disclosures will have to be considered in\ncurrent reporting timelines, as discussed later in this article.\nData, systems, and processes\nThe new disclosure framework will require both qualitative (describing the risks and insurers’ responses to them) and\nquantitative analysis such as:\n» Projections on how the climate and other sustainability-related risks will impact future financial performance.\n» Resilience of the entity’s cash flows to significant risks; or\n» Performance against targets to mitigate risks or enhance opportunities (including disclosing methods to calculate them,\nand whether they are based on external parameters or validated by third parties).\nThese disclosures will require a good understanding of the risks and opportunities in the sustainability space, informed by and\naligned with up-to-date market consistent information on such risks.\nNew data will have to be collected and stored. Some of this data will be internal(such as the amount of capital deployed\ntowards climate-related risks and opportunities or scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions) and will require new processes to\ncapture such data at the required level of granularity and to aggregate these as appropriate. Other data will be sourced\nexternally, e.g. from key suppliers, or market-wide information such as current climate risks in particular parts of the world.\nInsurers will also have to develop methodologies expanding current models that test sensitivity of cashflows and capital, to\naccommodate climate scenarios. The standard prototypes explicitly require the full range of possible outcomes, their\nlikelihood, and potential impact to be considered when assessing the materiality of possible future events. In addition, the\noutcomes of such analysis will have to be translated into their likely impacts on the financial performance and future cash\nflows to allow users to make informed decisions.\nRisk mitigation is another area where new calculation methods will have to be developed in order to disclose quantitative\ninformation about performance against targets. To achieve this, investors might favor external parameters to be used, in the\nsame way third-party validation is used to make the analysis more reliable.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS ON INSURERS 4Apart from cross-industry metrics such as the amount of assets or business activities vulnerable to physical or transition risks,\nthe climate-related disclosures prototype prescribes three types of industry-based metrics that will apply to insurance\nbusiness. These include:\n» Incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment management,\n» Policies designed to incentivize responsible behavior; and\n» Environmental risk exposure.\nThe first two metrics recognize the role that insurers play in promoting sustainability by directing capital into ESG-conscious\nareas and incentivizing health, safety and environmentally responsible behaviors. Together with a qualitative description of\ntheir approach to investment management and discussion of relevant product features, insurers will have to disclose\nquantitative information such as net premiums written related to energy efficiency and low carbon technology.\nThe environmental risk exposure disclosure requirement will apply in particular to non-life insurers. They will have to model\nand disclose their probable maximum loss (PML) from weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as total amount of\nmonetary losses attributable to insurance pay-outs from modeled and non-modelled natural catastrophes. PMLs have been in\nwidespread use in insurance companies for years, however, the main difference here is that few insurers currently incorporate\na climate adjusted PML. As such, insurers will be required to update their natural catastrophe models to allow for climate-\nchange scenarios. This may also impact their risk selection and exposure management.\nReporting timelines\nThe new IFRS Sustainability Disclosures will form part of an insurers general-purpose financial reporting. This means that all\nthe new processes to collect data, run models, analyze their results and present them in form of disclosures useful for end-\nusers will have to be incorporated into the general-purpose financial reporting timelines.\nIn addition, the prototypes extend the entity boundary concept and require, subject to materiality, the inclusion of\nsustainability information related to external parties such as key suppliers. As the suppliers will first need time to assess their\nown impacts, this dependence on external information can create additional constraints and pressures on an insurers’\nreporting cycle.\nGiven these additional burdens, insurers will have to find ways to accelerate the process of reporting the new disclosures if\ntheir current reporting deadlines are still to be met. For example, the collection and management of market-based climate risk\ndata could be left to external providers. Although some cross-industry metrics are entity-specific (e.g. proportion of executive\nmanagement remuneration impacted by climate risks), some other metrics may benefit from access to pre-collected input\ninformation. For example, reporting on the amount of assets or business activities vulnerable to transition or physical risks\nrequire information on these risks which is not a company-specific but rather market wide, and could be outsourced to an\nexternal provider.\nOne option to accelerate the reporting process is its automation. For example this could take form of an integrated reporting\ntool combining the data management, modeling, and reporting units to prepare disclosures in agreed formats.\nWhere and when will the new standards apply\nSimilar to other IFRS standards, the new ISSB standards will be voluntary, minimum standards. To become a reporting\nrequirement in a given jurisdiction, they will have to be adopted by governments into their local legislation. Any type of\nregional modifications, including carve-outs and additional requirements per jurisdiction are possible. However, one of the\nmain objectives of implementing IFRS is to create global comparability so any modifications are expected to be an exception.\nThe ISSB and their future standards have already gained international support from organizations such as International\nMonetary Fund and United Nations, as well as global financial regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board and\nInternational Organization of Securities Commission. This creates an expectation that the ISSB standards may become as\nwidely adopted as IFRS. For example, the UK Government has already declared its intention to endorse the ISSB standards to\nmake them a core of the sustainability reporting regime in the UK. Both the US and the EU have also expressed support for\nthe ISSB initiative, although they have not committed at this stage to adopting its standards in the future. The EU continues\nits work on the forthcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive which will provide EU-wide sustainability reporting\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS ON INSURERS 5standards. The way it will interact with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is currently unknown, but it will be\nimportant in determining the global status of the ISSB standards.\nThe adoption timeline of the ISSB standards in each jurisdiction will be decided locally. Before that, the work on issuing the\nstandards will have to commence. Currently hiring their key personnel, the ISSB plans to start to operate at the beginning of\n2022. As a first step, the ISSB will conduct a public consultation to inform its work plan and to get feedback on the prototypes\nof the two future standards. This is similar to the due process followed in creation of IFRS. Typically, it requires 120 days\ncomment period (with shorter periods allowed for narrow scope matters). If changes are required to the exposed drafts as a\nresult of this consultation, public meetings may be held before final decisions being taken. The ISSB will therefore have a busy\nyear ahead if they aim to issue the first batch of standards in 2022, as some expect.\nThe urgent need of global sustainability reporting standards means that the development process is likely to be accelerated\ncompared to previous IFRS standards, especially since there is scope to shorten the drafting period because the work is\nbuilding on existing frameworks. It also means that there is likely to be fewer contentious areas because it is more a question\nof enforcing the reporting practices that many entities are committed to adopt or are already applying on a voluntary basis. If\nso, it will help circumvent any lengthy delays due to fundamental changes needed to the draft requirements based on\ncomments received as was the case for IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.\nWhich companies will be obliged to report under the ISSB standards will depend on decisions taken by local endorsement\nbodies. For those deciding to accept the new standards, these will typically be mandatory for public and financial sector\ncompanies and their subsidiaries. However, given its importance, governments may decide that the sustainability and climate\nimpact of smaller insurers should also be monitored, extending the requirements of the ISSB standards beyond the typical\nscope of IFRS reporters. In this case, proportionality will have to be applied, perhaps in the form of a separate set of reduced\ndisclosures for SMEs, similar to current IFRS for SMEs.\nWhat should insurers be doing now?\nThose insurers who have already started disclosing climate and other sustainability information can start reviewing the scope\nand detail of their current disclosures to identify any gaps that will have to be addressed before the ISSB standards become\neffective. They should also closely monitor the work of the ISSB and use their opportunity to comment on the exposure drafts\nonce they are issued.\nThe reporting processes, systems, and data currently in use will need to be reviewed and revised as necessary since the new\nrequirements are likely to result in additional disclosure efforts. In particular, they will need to take time to:\n» Identify risks and develop methodologies to analyze their current and future impact.\n» Align their strategies, and the governance and risk management processes to address climate and other sustainability risks\nin a consistent manner with the new requirements.\n» Determine if he assessment of materiality of sustainability-related information for the users of the financial statements\nrequires new processes and methodologies to be developed.\nInsurers should start planning for these coming changes by identifying key priorities and milestones, and assessing the required\nresources needed to support these steps.\nLooking at the best practices around the current voluntary disclosures with recommendations such as TCFD are a good\nstarting point. They can give an idea about the scope and granularity of the information required and how the scenario\nanalysis was conducted.\nInsurers should remember that climate change may create new risks as well as opportunities, for example, improving\nefficiency or developing new products. Information related to climate and other sustainability-related opportunities can\npositively impact decisions taken by investors, creditors, and lenders.\nAbove all, it should be remembered that the overarching goal of creating the ISSB and new standards is a common effort to\ntransform businesses and align their strategies with the goal of reducing the climate change, saving the environment and\ncreating an ethical fair society, much needed for everyone to thrive.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS ON INSURERS 6This is part of a series of papers on climate risk topics for insurers.
