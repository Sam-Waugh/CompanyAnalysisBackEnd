Sustainable Development Goals that all U.N.\nmember states agreed to achieve by 2030. That target remains a long way off. According to the\nWorld Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index, which measures gender parity across economic,\neducational, health and political dimensions, at the current rate, it will take 132 years to reach full parity.\nIn this note, we focus on one narrow dimension of the gender gap: the proportion of women in senior and\nmiddle management positions. This proportion lags men by a significant margin across the globe.\nChart 1: Share of Females in Middle and Senior Leadership Positions\n* Singapore and UAE comparison dates differ from the other countries as they are the earliest available data.\nSources: ILO, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 1\nLimited and divergent progress has been made in elevating females in the workplace over the past decade. In\nsome countries, progress towards gender equality in the workforce seems to be headed in reverse—in the U.K.,\nFrance and Turkey, the share of women in senior and middle management positions declined from 2010 to 2019.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Close the Gender Gap to UnloCk prodUCtivity Gains 2Gender gaps vary significantly across sectors. historically male-dominated sectors, including mining and\nconstruction, have a much lower representation of female managers compared with the health and social\nwork and education sectors.\nTable 1: Share of Female Leaders by Sector, G-20 Average\n%\nHealth and social work 67.1\nEducation 61.0\nFinancial services 45.1\nPublic admin and defence 42.9\nProfessional, scientific and technical 41.2\nInformation and communications 32.9\nManufacturing 26.6\nMining 19.6\nConstruction 13.7\nAvg 38\nSources: ILO, Moody’s Analytics\nSectors expected to drive future productivity, including information and technology via the increasing digi-\ntisation of the economy, have a much lower share of female leaders than other service sectors. This alone\nsuggests that women are primed to miss out on the potential wage and income gains from this rapidly\nexpanding sector.\nIn all sectors, gender gaps widen as you move up the seniority ladder. Globally, only 23% of executive roles\nare held by women.\nChart 2: The More Senior the Position, the Wider the Gender Gap\nDifference between the share of positions held by women and men globally, ppts, 2020\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nSupport staff Professionals Managers Senior managers Executives\nSources: Edwards, R., Guzzo, R., Jackson, C., Knoepflmacher, A., & Nalbantian, H.

But, except for a\nhandful of countries—costa rica, Mexico, chile and Turkey—the gender gap in labour force participation\ncan explain less than half of the gender gap in management positions.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Close the Gender Gap to UnloCk prodUCtivity Gains 350\n40\nTurkey\n30\n20 Costa Rica Mexico Malta\nChile Romania Colombia South Korea\n10 Poland Brazil Argentin Sa ouA thu Ast fr ri ia caGreece Czechia Italy Japan\n0 S Lw ae tU vd i. aS en.A.

Japan and South Korea stand out with exceptionally high gender gaps in management.\nDoes the skills gap explain the gender gap in management?\nIf the gender imbalance of the aggregate labour pool can explain only a fraction of the gender imbalance\nin management, perhaps the gender management gap reflects a skills mismatch. Do female youths devote\nless time to educational attainment than their male counterparts, leading to women that lack the founda-\ntion skills needed to excel in management?\nOn the contrary, the opposite tends to be true. In most OEcD countries and major emerging markets, the\nnumber of women age 25 to 64 with a master’s degree or equivalent exceeds that of men.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Close the Gender Gap to UnloCk prodUCtivity Gains 4\n%\n,etar\nnoitapicitrap\nni\npag redneG\nChart 3: Can Labour Force Participation Explain the Gender Gap in Management?\nGender gap in management, %\nLabour force fully explains management gap Labour force explains up to 50% of management gap\nLabour force explains up to 25% of management gap\nSources: OECD, ILO, Moody’s Analytics\nChart 4: Can Educational Attainment Explain the Gender Gap in Management?\nDifference between share of men and share of women with master’s degree or equivalent, ppts\nJapan\nSouth Africa\nSouth Korea\nGreece\nLuxembourg\nTurkey\nBelgium Switzerland\nFrance\nCosta Rica\nNetherlands Mexico\nChile\nHungary\nNorway\nBrazil\nGermany\nCzechia Austria\nCanada\nDenmark\nU.K.\nAustralia\nSweden Ireland\nColombia Spain\nU.S.A.

The act compelled firms with more than 300\nemployees to develop action plans to foster female leadership development. But this was insufficient to\nachieve its goal of having females occupy 30% of managerial positions by 2020.\nWomen are consistently overqualified for their jobs\nIf women achieve higher educational attainment than men but are significantly underrepresented in\nmiddle and senior management roles, we can draw two conclusions: The returns on education are lower\nfor women, and this reflects a consistent ‘underskilling’ of women in the workforce. On average, women\nmake a higher upfront investment in education but tend to land in lower-level and lower-paid positions,\nemployed below their skill level, as measured by their educational accomplishments.\nMore broadly, measures of labour underutilisation, which include people who want to work more hours\nthan their current employment allow, systematically show that the underutilisation rates of women exceed\nthose of men across a broad spectrum of advanced, emerging and developing economies, with rare excep-\ntions including Armenia, Ghana and Mongolia. This is true at all levels of education.\n30\n25\nArmenia Montenegro Georgia Albania\nSouth Africa Botswana\n20 Sierra Leone\nGhana North Mace Ld eo sn oia thoNamibia Burkina FasoLiberia Colomb Kia enya Nepal Iran\nBolivia Uganda Togo\n15\nSeychelles\nGuyanaMongolia ChS ilo euth KoreaCypr B Su r es u rn be iaiI n Dd ao rn ue ss si aa lam DominicG ar ne Rec ee pubL lie cHba on no dn uras Turkey\n10 Marshall IslandC sanada FranceLao Tim Eo l r S-L ae lvs ate dor AuC so ts rata li aRica Brazil Zambia Bangladesh\nU.S.A.Malta Slo Sv ie nn gi aE a ps oto renia AustU rir aS ua gm uao ya Tonga SwG itzu ea rt le am ndala Bosnia and Herzegovina\n5 Cambodia Thailand IsV raie et l Nam Mauritius Sri Lanka\nMoldova Slovakia Belarus Barbados BelizeParaguay\nHungaryMaldivesMyanmar\n0 Czechia\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nMoody’s Analytics Presentation Title, Month 2022 5\nBe what you can see\nA more difficult concept to quantify is around leader identity. It is easier for a female to identify as a leader\nwhen there are other female leaders in similar industries and, more broadly, across society. Women can\nstruggle to identify as leaders when they have limited exposure to female leadership networks. As a result,\nit may be difficult for females to develop their identity as a leader and motivate themselves to pursue lead-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Close the Gender Gap to UnloCk prodUCtivity Gains 5\ndecnavda\nhtiw\nnem\nfo\nnoitasiliturednU\n% ,noitacude\nChart 5: Women Are Underutilised in the Workforce Relative to Men\nUnderutilisation of women with advanced education, %\nEquality\nSources: ILO, Moody’s Analyticsership opportunities. There is more evidence of this in societies where prominent female leaders are not\npresent, including in Japan.\nEconomic potential suffers worldwide from the “underskilling” of women\nThe underutilisation of women in the workforce, in terms of underutilising their skills and time, causes an\neconomic loss at the individual and macroeconomic levels. Bridging the gender gap in management posi-\ntions and raising women in the workforce to their potential would raise productivity and economic output\nacross the globe.\nBased on a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation, closing the gender gap in labour force participation\nand the gender gap in management in OEcD countries can raise global economic activity by approximately\n7%, or about $7 trillion in today’s dollars. closing the gaps in large emerging economies, including India,\nwould raise that potential further.\nThis boost to economic activity stems from a rise in the number of people in work, with more women join-\ning the labour force and an increase in productivity, as a greater share of women become employed in more\nproductive managerial and professional roles.\nQuantifying the benefit\nWe can quantify the benefit by disaggregating potential output into potential employment and labour pro-\nductivity. The rise in potential employment is calibrated as the percentage increase in the number of people\nin the workforce across the OEcD if the labour force participation of women age 25 to 64 were equivalent\nto the labour force participation of men age 25 to 64 in 2021. This alone would raise potential output in the\nOEcD by nearly 10% and global output by 6.2%.\nTo calibrate the rise in potential productivity, we make use of the simplifying assumption that wages should\nclosely track productivity. This follows from a standard set of profit-maximizing conditions, holding various\nbehavioural patterns and preferences constant. While many caveats are attached to this assumption, it pro-\nvides a useful benchmark.\nWe draw on average wage differentials between female managers, female professionals, and other female\nemployees in the U.S., Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. in 2021 to calibrate an estimate of poten-\ntial productivity growth. On average, female managers were paid 89.6% above the average wage, and\nfemale professionals earned 37.3% more than the average, which gives us the productivity factors of 1.896\nfor managers and 1.373 for professionals.\nExploiting historical data on employment in the OEcD by occupation, which splits out managers, pro-\nfessionals and other occupations, we calibrate a baseline productivity level from the shares of managers,\nprofessionals and others employed in the OEcD in 2021, applying these productivity factors. We then ask,\nhow many more managers and professionals would there be if the share of female managers increased from\n37% to 50% and the share of female professionals increased from 42% to 50%? A fraction of this rise will\nbe met by the rise in female labour force participation, with no net impact expected on labour productiv-\nity if there is a proportional rise in other occupations. But the excess rise in managers and professionals to\nmeet the 50% targets draws women out of lower-productivity occupations, leading to a net rise in poten-\ntial productivity of 1.1% in the OEcD, raising potential global output by about 0.7%.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Close the Gender Gap to UnloCk prodUCtivity Gains 6Conclusion\nImproving gender parity in management positions has the potential to unlock higher economic prosperity\nacross the globe. Surveys on the root causes of the gender gap in management point to the heavier bur-\nden of family responsibilities carried by women, a lack of access to the same kind of connections as men,\nwomen being less likely to ask for promotions, as well as women being held to higher standards than men.\nShifting social norms is a lengthy and complex process, but policies such as enforcing flexible working con-\nditions and providing affordable childcare as well as paid maternity and paternity leave help to drive change\nin the right direction. This would be particularly beneficial for developing economies, where the economic\npotential that would be unlocked from improved gender equality is higher than in developed nations.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Close the Gender Gap to UnloCk prodUCtivity Gains 7About the Authors\nDawn Holland is a director of economic research at Moody’s Analytics, where she focuses on European economies\nand climate modelling. her background is in macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, with a focus on fiscal policy\nand modelling interactions between the macroeconomy, poverty, inequality and the environment.
