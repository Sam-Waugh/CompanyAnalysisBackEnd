The arm’s length principle asks for credibility of the transaction if it occurs in\na competition-free situation or in a market situation.\nThis credibility is endorsed by the calculation of a market-related interest rate (also known as risk remuneration), as well as proof\nthat the group’s financing company has the financial capacity to assume the loan’s credit risk, and that it can support the financial\nconsequences of the risk if it occurs. This financial capacity is referred to as the “equity-at-risk.”\nRisk remuneration implies specific care given to a comparable analysis. It focuses on two pillars:\n» Identifying the points for comparison. A credit analysis must be done to define the issuer’s credit quality. This analysis\nmust be done with techniques and models used and certified by recognized credit professionals.\n» Finding the said comparable. Once the adequate factors have been determined, a comparable must be found through\nbenchmarking of existing transactions in the market. These transactions can include loans, bonds with similar duration\nand maturity, as well as equivalent credit quality. The transfer pricing professional must precisely define what has been\nconsidered as the correct comparable, and it must also provide a list of comparables that have been excluded.\nEquity-at-risk is defined as the necessary capital to assume the risk taken in the financial transaction. This notion is similar to\ncurrent financial institutions regulations such as Basel III and IFRS 9.\nHowever, the provisioned capital required by the Luxembourg Tax Authorities must be less complex and less constraining than for\nfinancial institutions. Indeed, regulations attached to the transfer pricing activity differ from banking capital regulations.\nThis equity-at-risk principle is based on the calculation of the loan’s expected loss.\n2 Expected Loss Definition\nExpected loss is not, as such, a calculation of risk, but it is rather a forecast of usual losses. By nature, risk is unexpected. The\nexpected loss on a portfolio of loans represents the loss that must be accepted and priced, due to the nature of the loan activity.\nExpected loss is a cost of doing business.\nAs a formula, we calculate expected loss as follows:\nExpected Loss (EL) = Probability of Default (PD) x Loss Given Default (LGD) x Exposure at Default (EAD)\nEL equals multiplying the chance of default by what is lost in the case of default and the exposure at the default.\nExpected loss tends to be considered as a percentage of loss, on which the exposure is applied to create an absolute number.\nProbability of default and expected loss are two-dimensional data points: the level of the risk is important, as is the time horizon\ntaken into consideration.\n3 OCTOBER 2018CREDIT RISK ANALYTICS\n3 Differentiating Expected Losses\nThe notion of Expected Loss has several dimensions, as explained earlier. The time period considered is crucial. We can\ndifferentiate three types of expected loss calculations, matching three types of probability of default (multiplied by LGD provides\nEL). Table 1 shows an extract from Moody’s Analytics RiskCalc™ solution. This model provides clients with an EDF™ (Expected\nDefault Frequency) credit measure — a Probability of Default — and also a second output, the LGD necessary for the equity-at-risk\ncalculation.\nTable 1 Example of Expected Loss Term Structure\nCumulative Expected Loss\nThe cumulative expected loss notion represents the expected loss as it can be expected over the analyzed loan’s lifetime.\nA cumulative EDF credit measure gives the probability of default over that time period. For example, a five-year cumulative\nEDF credit measure of 4.98% means that a company has a 4.98% chance of defaulting during that five-year period. The\nsecond row in Table 1 provides an example of the cumulative one- to five-year credit measures produced by the RiskCalc\nmodel.\nWhen we multiply this output by the LGD following the correct time horizon, the cumulative EDF aids in calculating a\ncumulative expected loss that represents the expected loss over the life of the loan.\nAnnualized Expected Loss\nThe annualized EDF credit measure is the cumulative EDF value for a given period, stated on a per-year basis. These credit\nmeasures are derived from the cumulative EDF values. This means that the average default rate per year for a 4.98%\ncumulative default rate is 1.02%. The last row in Table 1 shows the annualized EDF credit measures for years one through five.\nApplying the same principle to the cumulative expected loss provides the annualized expected loss.\nForward Expected Loss\nThe forward-EDF credit measure is the probability of default between t-1 and t, conditional upon survival until t-1. In other words,\nthe four-year, forward-EDF measure is the probability that a firm will default between years three and four, assuming the firm\nsurvived to year three. Table 1 displays the forward one- to five-year EDF credit measures derived from the cumulative EDF values.\nThis forward-looking EDF, multiplied by the time-corresponding LGD, can estimate a loan’s expected loss, conditional to survival\n(non-default), at time t.\nThe same loan at five years or at one year may seem different. For the calculation of the interest rate, Moody’s Analytics\nrecommends examining the loan’s full term, taking into consideration the loan’s rating for a time period matching the term.\nFor the equity-at-risk, different approaches should be considered, based on the highly illiquid characteristics of a loan and its over-\nthe-counter nature.\nThe loan must be considered over its lifetime, but, as stated in the Circulaire, substance must prevail over form.\n4 OCTOBER 2018CREDIT RISK ANALYTICS\n4 Substance Over Form\nThe Luxembourg Tax Authority confirms that the economic reality of the transaction should prevail over the contractual terms of\nthe agreement. This can affect the credit quality analysis, in the consideration of the country of activity, or, potentially, in the\nduration of the financial agreement to be taken into consideration.\nConsidering the loan as either year-by-year rolling capital or as a single, long-term, unalterable deal depends on several\ncharacteristics, including rating, liquidity, contracting, and loan formatting. A common practice in provisioning decisions considers\nthe issuer’s credit quality as the primary factor.\nThere are no particular definitions of risky or safe characteristics for a loan. Other capital calculation regulations consider a\nseparation between a security considered investment grade by the model used at origination, with an implied rating above and\nincluding Baa3, and a security considered non-investment grade, with an implied rating under and including Baa1.\nIf this characteristic is taken into consideration, a best practice would consider a one-year expected loss as the decisive equity-at-\nrisk needed for a safe loan. This notion of capital calculation is dynamic, and it is usually reviewed by the banking industry on a\nterm or yearly basis. In this case, the expected loss to consider is the one-year expected loss, with frequent reviews of the expected\nloss based on new financials and credit risk evolution.\nIt is important to keep in mind that the expected loss is not time-invariant; it evolves with both macroeconomic and intrinsic\nchanges. However, for private loans, the processes tend to be less dynamic, and this operation is done at loan origination. In this\ncase, two approaches can be considered. For a constant expected loss calculation, the equity-at-risk can be seen as the annualized\nexpected loss, taking into consideration the loan’s duration, or at least a long-term, annualized expected loss. Models available on\nthe market tend to provide a five-year annualized probability of default and a long-term loss given default or a five-year expected\nloss on an annualized basis. The exposure at default is, in all cases, determined by the expected cash flows over the life of the loan.\nFor example, the capital-at-risk on a yearly basis for a bullet loan will differ from the capital-at-risk for an amortized loan. This\nsetup is valid regardless of the expected loss method considered, but it is purely a matter of exposure at default.\nWhen an advisory professional requires a more dynamic pattern along with an evolution of the capital over the lifetime of the\nloan, we recommend considering the forward-looking expected loss. This vantage provides a more accurate view of the loan’s\ncredit risk evolution, including the conditional event of non-default. In non-stressed companies, the forward one year is lower after\na couple of years than on the first year, coherent with the easing of the equity-at-risk, as the loan is repaid year after year.\nIf the loan is considered a risk, the expected loss should be proposed on a lifetime basis. For long-term periods, the expected loss\ncan be approximated using the five-year probability of default as a proxy and a calculated lifetime loss given default. The exposure\nat default remains linked to the cash flows expected during the loan’s life. This method should expose a higher equity-at-risk, and\nit should correctly reflect the need for more liquidity with riskier securities. However, when looking at a loan’s full term, it is\nimportant to use the present value of the loan and not the nominal, using the exposure at default to correctly adapt the provision\non a yearly basis. Discounting value is necessary to avoid over-provisioning, which can damage a company’s balance sheet.\nWe often state that Expected Loss (EL) equals the PD multiplied by the LGD and EAD, a flow concept rather than a stock concept.\nFor example, if the coupon covers the expected loss plus the time value of money, the loan will hold its value over time.\nComputing the EL on a ten-year loan requires a full-term structure of PD values, interest rates, and LGD and EAD estimates.\nA credit transaction’s expected loss calculation provides an objective valuation of the credit risk embedded in it. The thorough\nwork of financial and legal experts ensures accurate pricing and the sustainability of a transaction according to the arm’s length\nprinciple recommended by the OECD and implemented by the 2016 Circulaire in Luxembourg.\nThe multi-dimensionality of the expected loss serves the new regulation well. Additionally, a full understanding of the loan itself\nenables the correct assessment of the necessary equity-at-risk to justify a safe transaction. This full understanding must go\nthrough a non-systematic, dedicated analysis of the said transaction to input expert knowledge and adjust the correct figures.\n5 OCTOBER 2018CREDIT RISK ANALYTICS\nReferences\nGouvernement du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, Circulaire du directeur des contributions L.I.R n°56/1-56bis/1 du 27 décembre\n2016.\nGouvernement du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg, Circulaire du directeur des contributions L.I.R n°164/2du 28 janvvier 2011.\nKorablev, Irina, S.
