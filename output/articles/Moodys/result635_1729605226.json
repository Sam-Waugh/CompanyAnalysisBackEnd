The two approaches are referred to as ‘top-down’ or ‘bottom-up’,\nand are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: IFRS 17 yield curve constructing approaches\nThis paper outlines the key considerations to be addressed when using each approach.\n1. Given that the IFRS 17 regulation specifies fair value & market-consistent treatment of liabilities, there is\na strong incentive for insurers to use the option of reporting fair value through OCI for assets, even when\nthey are classified as ‘held to maturity’. This is in order to avoid accounting mismatches leading to significant\nvolatility in the net financial results (e.g. investment income from assets plus insurance finance expenses\nfrom liabilities).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PERMITTED APPROACHES FOR CONSTRUCTING IFRS 17 DISCOUNT RATES 1The Bottom-Up Method curve fitting approach adopted for SII and International\nCapital Standards.\nDefining a Basis for the Risk-Free rate\nAdjustments To The Risk-Free Curve\nA fully liquid risk free yield curve is the foundation for the\n‘bottom-up’ approach outlined in Figure 1.
