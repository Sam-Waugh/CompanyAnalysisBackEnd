To assess the complete picture, we must also consider the changes taking place with the implementation of IFRS 9 which\ncovers the measurement of fi nancial instruments. To evaluate the effect of the new accounting standards on P&L, insurers must be\naware of the potential for accounting mismatches if the classifi cation choices under IFRS 9 are inconsistent with the treatment and\nclassifi cation under IFRS 17.\nIFRS 9\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaced IAS 39 effective 1 January 2018. However, there was an option for insurers to defer\nimplementation of IFRS 9 to align with the introduction of IFRS 17. Most insurers have chosen this option and thus deferred\nimplementation of IFRS 9 to coincide with the IFRS 17 start date.\nUnder IFRS 9, there are three categories for asset classifi cation:\nCategory Description\nFVPL Assets are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and all gains and losses are recognized in\nFair value through profi t and loss profi t and loss (P&L) as they arise.\nAmortized Cost Assets are measured on an amortized basis.

Changes in fair value are initially recognized\nFair value through other in other comprehensive income (OCI). Upon sale of an FVOCI asset, the change in fair value\ncomprehensive income previously recognized in OCI is recycled to P&L.\nFigure 1 illustrates the classifi cation model for assets under IFRS 9. Insurers must consider the “solely payments of principal and\ninterest” (SPPI) test which, along with the business test, determines the classifi cation.\nFigure 1: The classifi cation model for assets under IFRS 9\nSolely principal and interest\nHold to collect\nHold to collect Other\n& to sell\nBusiness model is to Business model is to both\ncollect the cash fl ows collect the cash and to sell\nAmortized cost FVOCI FVPL\nOR\nFVPL\nOption to designate to FVPL, only if it signifi cantly reduces\naccounting mismatch\nIf an asset meets the SPPI test, there are two possible measurement models depending on the business model:\n» Held to collect: If the asset portfolio is held to collect contractual cash fl ows, then measurement is at amortized cost.

For example, this applies where an insurer collects bond cash fl ows to meet insurance liabilities.\nHowever, to ensure that cash fl ows are suffi cient to settle the liabilities, the insurer also regularly rebalances the portfolio and\ntherefore undertakes regular buying and selling of the bonds.\nCrucially, there is also an option to designate at FVPL. Insurers can choose to classify fi nancial assets at FVPL if, by doing so, they\neliminate or signifi cantly reduce the accounting mismatch, more formally referred to as a measurement or recognition inconsistency.\nThis mismatch arises when gains and losses from assets and liabilities are recognized on different bases, which could be the case upon\ntransition to IFRS 17. In this paper, we consider the case where the insurer has applied the option to designate at FVPL and therefore\nthe assets are reported at FVPL.\nCase study\nTo illustrate the interaction between IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, we consider an IFRS 17 contract group consisting of immediate annuities. The\ngeneral measurement model is applied and the analysis considers the impact of different liability discount rates on the projected P&L.\nIn terms of classifi cation approach, we consider the case where the insurer elects the same accounting option for assets and liabilities,\nwhich is to book both at fair value through P&L. The impact of interest rate changes on the value of the insurance contracts are\nrecognized at FVPL and the asset movements are also classifi ed at FVPL. Assuming asset and liability cash fl ows are well matched,\nit is reasonable to assume that this option lowers the P&L volatility, relative to reporting the asset at amortized cost. There is also\nthe option to classify the assets at FVOCI, which might be another feasible choice for insurers, subject to the business model test\noutcome.\nIn this paper, we use an agile1 valuation model to project the fi nancial statements, in particular the P&L, and to analyze the effect\nof different scenarios. This enables the impact of decisions such as discount rate methodology to be assessed. The case study uses\nstochastic models. The projected asset returns and liability discount factors are generated using an Economic Scenario Generator. The\nassets are assumed to be invested in corporate bonds, which are cash fl ow matched to the expected liability outgo, with an additional\nholding in cash. The liability discount curve is based on a risk-free yield curve with an adjustment for an illiquidity premium, and this\npaper illustrates sensitivities to the size of the illiquidity premium. The demographic risks are also modeled stochastically with the\nannuitant mortality rates generated using a stochastic mortality model.\nP&L reporting under IFRS 17\nUnder IFRS 17, the profi t and loss disclosure attempts to differentiate between the source of profi t or loss arising from providing the\ninsurance coverage and that arising from investment income. The P&L must be separated into the insurance service result and the net\nfi nancial result.\nInsurance service result\n» The Insurance Service Result includes the release of the risk adjustment and release of the contractual service margin (CSM). The\nCSM is released over time in proportion to the chosen coverage units.\n» Changes in the mortality assumptions have an effect on the insurance service result.

In this\nexample, the liquidity premium2 is evaluated as 50% * {spread\non the corporate bond portfolio – 40 bp}.\nWe consider the scenario where there are no changes to\nassumptions and the yield curves (both risk-free and credit\nspreads) evolve as per the initial curve, and there are no defaults\nor transitions experienced on the bond portfolio. The projected\nP&L is shown in fi gure 2b, split in to the insurance service result\nand the net fi nancial result. To illustrate the impact on expected\nprofi t emergence of including an illiquidity premium in the\nliability valuation, we compare against the two “boundary” Figure 2b\ncases: the case where the liability discount curve is the risk-free\ndiscount curve (that is, no liquidity premium, see fi gure 2a), and\nthe case where the liability discount curve includes the full yield\non the assets (see fi gure 2c). The latter is extreme but serves as\na useful comparison point for our analysis. In this scenario, we\nproject the P&L for 10 years and compare the results.\nThese charts illustrate how the choice of liability discount rate\ninfl uences the profi le of projected P&L. Opting for a more\naggressive discount rate on day 1 (that is, higher illiquidity\npremium) will result in a higher CSM, which leads to higher\nprojected insurance service results as this higher CSM is\nreleased. However, projected net fi nancial results are lower,\nas liabilities unwind at a higher rate. In the extreme example\nwhere the liability discount rate is the same as the asset\nFigure 2c\nyield, the investment income on assets offsets almost exactly\nagainst the fi nance expense on liabilities and the reported net\nfi nancial result is close to zero for the next fi ve years (the only\ncontribution being interest earned on the surplus cash and\ninterest accreted on the CSM).\nOver the lifetime of the business, the total P&L will be the same\nunder all examples. It is the timing of recognition of the P&L—\nand the allocation between insurance service result and net\nfi nancial result—that is infl uenced by the decision regarding the\nchoice of discount rate.\nInsurance service result\nNet fi nancial result\n2 This formula was originally developed by the CFO forum for MCEV reporting.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 13Impact of choice of liability discount rate on earnings volatility\nRather than look at a single scenario, the agile model provides Figure 3: Comparison of the net fi nancial result\nthe ability to investigate many scenarios.

Note that even in this extreme case there is some\nvolatility primarily due to rating migrations on the asset\nFigure 3b\nportfolio.\nFigure 3c\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 14Similarly, the stochastic model can be used to assess the Figure 4: Comparison of the insurance service result\nvolatility of the insurance service result, as shown in Figure Figure 4a\n4. This shows the results from the same sample of scenarios\nfrom the stochastic modeling. As described earlier the liability\ndiscount rate affects the CSM, and therefore the probability of a\ncontract group becoming onerous, and so affects the volatility\nof the insurance service result. The impact of introducing an\nilliquidity premium is an increase in the initial CSM, which\nmeans there is less chance of the CSM being wiped out and thus\nany mortality assumption change has a lower impact on the\ninsurance service result.\nFigure 4b\nFigure 4c\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 15Summary\nThe principles-based nature of IFRS 17 means that signifi cant judgement will be involved in implementing the standard. The\nmethodology used to defi ne the liability discount rate is one of the key decisions that companies must make, and there have been\nseveral articles on this topic.3 The current focus is on IFRS 17 and interpreting the principles but insurers must not forget about IFRS 9,\nwhich is also a complex standard. It is important to understand how the two standards interact, the resulting earnings volatility, and\nthe sensitivity of volatility to methodology choices available under both standards (in particular the OCI option under IFRS 17 and\noption to classify as FVPL under IFRS 9). The use of projection models and stochastic modeling can be a useful tool in assessing the\nimpact of these decisions.\nThis paper considered the case of a well-matched annuity portfolio where the insurer elected to report movements in both assets and\nliabilities at FVPL. By selecting the same accounting treatment on both sides of the balance sheet, this helps reduce P&L volatility,\nwith the degree of volatility dependent on the size of the illiquidity premium included in the liability discount rate. Furthermore, the\npaper illustrates how the choice of liability discount rate infl uences the allocation of P&L between the insurance service result and the\nnet fi nancial result.\n3 Refer to Permitted approaches for constructing IFRS 17 Discount Rates, Nick Jessop.\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2018/permitted-approaches-for-constructing-ifrs17-discount-rates.pdf\nThe top-down approach is covered in more detail in A cost of capital approach to estimating credit risk premia, Alasdair Thompson and Nick Jessop.\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2018/a-cost-of-capital-approach-to-estimating-credit-risk-premium.pdf\nBP57290\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS PROFIT EMERGENCE UNDER IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17: THE IMPACT OF CHOICE OF LIABILITY DISCOUNT RATE 16Calibration A Cost of Capital Approach to Estimating Credit\nMethods\nRisk Premia\nAuthors\nExecutive Summary\nAlasdair Thompson\nNick Jessop This note discusses the credit risk premium adjustment required for constructing discount\nMoody’s Analytics Research rates specifi ed by the IFRS 17 accounting rules.

Introduction\nThe permitted approaches to fi tting yield curves for IFRS 17 were outlined in a previous white paper (Jessop 2018). The rules specify\ntwo approaches, known as ‘bottom up’ and ‘top down’ which in theory should lead to equivalent results (a unique set of IFRS 17\ndiscount rates). Our primary focus in this paper is in estimating the top down curves and specifi cally the adjustment for credit risk\npremium (which can be interpreted theoretically as the market premium associated with unexpected credit losses). The discount\nrates for liability valuation are not just critical in determining the present value of future cash fl ows reported in the balance sheet, but\nalso in determining how profi t and loss will be recognised under the heading of ‘Insurance Financial Expenses’ in the comprehensive\nincome statement. The two yield curve approaches are outlined in Figure 3.\nFigure 1 IFRS 17 yield curve construction approaches\nExpected credit\nlosses\nCredit Risk\npremium\nMismatch\nYield Curve\nadjustment\nbased on actual\nor reference\nIlliquidity\nportfolio.\npremium\nIFRS 17 Discount\nRate\nRisk Free Rate.\nTop Down Bottom Up\nAssuming the reference portfolio in the top down approach is defi ned in a way which minimises any mismatch adjustment (made to\nrefl ect differences in amount, timing and uncertainty between the reference asset portfolio and liabilities), then the most challenging\ntechnical parts of the construction process are likely to be the adjustments for the expected credit losses and the credit risk premium.\nDifferent approaches for calculating the expected losses are possible (leveraging a broad range of probability of default and loss given\ndefault modelling techniques). For example, under Solvency II a ‘through the cycle’ (TTC) approach to estimating the credit losses is\nmade which results in a very stable (effectively constant) estimate of the credit losses. This estimate is based on a combination of long\nterm historical default and loss given default statistics and long term historical credit spread levels.\nIf this TTC estimate of loss was used on its own (or in combination with a constant credit risk premium adjustment in order to isolate\nthe liquidity premium component of spread) this would lead to most of the spread market volatility being attributed to changes in\nliquidity premia.\nHowever, in SII more ‘point in time’ volatility and matching adjustments are made by attributing only a proportion of the excess\nspread to the volatility and matching adjustments. This proportional adjustment is somewhat ad-hoc, but can be interpreted as a\nproxy for a pro-cyclical estimate of each component of the credit spread (embedding a view that market spreads, expected losses\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 19and credit risk are all positively correlated). This results in liability discount curves which partially but not completely mirror changes\nin market spreads for credit risky bonds. In turn this reduces but does not minimise completely the signifi cance of ALM mismatches\narising when liabilities are backed by duration (or cashfl ow) matched fi xed income asset portfolios.\nFigure 2 shows changes in market spreads (left) and PIT estimates of 1 year expected default frequency (right) over a ten year period\nfor selected economies – in each case the averages are weighted by amount outstanding and are calculated for bonds with maturities\nfrom 4-5 years.\nFigure 2\nThe modelling method outlined in this paper leverages a structural approach to estimating both components of the credit\nadjustment. This approach naturally introduces point in time characteristics to not only the expected losses component of credit\nspread but also the estimates of credit risk premium and illiquidity premia. The method leverages existing data and modelling\ntechniques broadly used by Moody Analytics’ clients for probability of default, loss given default and expected loss modelling.\nIn section 2 we begin by reviewing the Merton model of credit risk, which will form the basis for the structural approach taken in this\npaper. Having reviewed the basic model, we then detail the enhancement made by Moody’s to create our Public Firm EDF™ model of\nreal world expected default. The section concludes by considering how the model can be reconciled with approaches to expected loss\ncalculation for IFRS 9.\nSection 3 builds on the expected loss calculation to add a credit risk premium and derives a methodology to set this adjustment.\nSection 4 then applies the model to a set of market portfolios of corporate debt to derive a decomposition of spreads into expected\nloss, credit risk premium and illiquidity premium components. Having applied the model, the sensitivity to several key underlying\nassumptions such as equity risk premium, leverage and the choice of risk free rate is examined.\nFinally, section 5 concludes the paper by restating the fundamental problem to be addressed, the solution proposed in this paper and\nsome considerations for further research in order to produce a robust method with could be implemented in practice.\n2. Estimating Real World Probability of Default\n2.1. A Brief Review of the Merton Model\nTo estimate the real world probability of default, we will follow a structural model of credit risk as pioneered by Fischer Black, Robert\nMerton and Myron Scholes.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 20The Merton model starts from the realisation that equity in a fi rm can be considered as a call option on the fi rm’s assets with a strike\nprice equal to the face value of the debt. The capital structure of the fi rm is defi ned simply as a sum of debt ( ) and equity ( ).\nD E\nThe asset price is assumed to follow a lognormal, stochastic process and default occurs when the value of the fi rm’s assets falls\nAssets = Debt + Equity\nbelow the value of the debt. Specifi cally, in Merton’s original formulation default occurs only if the asset price is below the debt at a\nspecifi ed, usually one year, horizon. Figure 3 below shows the model schematically, where the asset value varies stochastically and\nforms a distribution of market values at a horizon, the probability of default is given by the integral of this distribution below the\ndefault point.\nFigure 3\nWorking in the risk neutral measure we can write the stochastic process for the asset price ( ) as:\nA\nwhere is the risk free rate, is the volatility of the asset price and is a risk neutral Wiener process.\nQ\nThen, rrefcalling that the optiσonA pricing framework where equity is a cdaWll on the assets, where the payoff for the equity is\nand is the face value of the debt, by Black-Scholes the market value of the debt will be given by\nmax(0, A - K)\nK\nwhere\nand\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 21We can also write the market value of the debt as the discounted face value to defi ne a fair value spread\nCombining the two expressions for the market value of the debt, we can then write the fair value spread as\nThe Merton model framework also allows us to derive the risk neutral probability of default\nSwitching to the real world measure we can replace the risk free rate with the real world expected asset return to get a real world\nprobability of default\nrf rA\nwhere\nThe Merton model is a simple, but widely used, starting point to understand credit risk building from a structural analysis of the fi rm.\nSince Merton’s original paper, many extensions have been proposed to account for more complex capital structures, to allow for\ndefault at any point rather than a fi xed horizon, stochastic interest rates, cash payments, and transaction and liquidation costs. In the\nnext section we describe the extension used in the Moody’s Public Firm EDF™ model.\n2.2. Moody’s EDF™ Model\nMoody’s Analytics’ Public Firm EDF™ (Expected Default Frequency) model has been the industry-leading probability of default\nmodel since its introduction in the early 1990s. Since that time it has continually evolved to provide a sophisticated model of real\nworld default frequencies. Moody’s EDF model is based on the Vasicek-Kealhofer (VK) variant of the Merton model described above.\nThis variant extends the Merton model in a number of key respects, in particular to consider a more complex capital structure for a\nfi rm, with a range of liability classes for short and long term debt; to incorporate a concept of preferred stock; and to allow for cash\nleakages in the form of coupons, dividends and interest payments.\nThe EDF model also replaces the naïve use of the total debt in the Merton model with a default point calculated at the sum of current\nliabilities plus half the long term liabilities. In addition, the latest version of the EDF model makes a cost of capital adjustment to the\ndefault point for fi nancial fi rms, to refl ect changes in interest rate environment and their effect on the depletion of working capital.\nBoth the Merton and VK models require an estimate of asset volatility to determine the distance-to-default. Unlike market\ncapitalisation, neither equity, nor asset, volatility are directly observable in the market and the estimation of volatility is therefore an\nimportant element of the calibration of the model. Moody’s EDF model uses a weighted average of empirically measured volatility\nover a historical window and a modelled volatility based on the size, location and business type of the fi rm.\nFinally, the EDF model removes the assumption of normality for the relationship between distance-to-default (DD) and the\nprobability of default. The distance-to-default gives an ordinal measure of the default risk. Interpreted as a number of standard\ndeviations, the DD can be converted to a PD, using a normal cumulative distribution function\nPD=N(-DD).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 22In practice, Moody’s calibrate a more accurate empirical mapping\nThe calibration of the empirical mapping to a database of historical defaults is one of the primary inputs to the Moody’s VK/EDF\nPD=M(-DD).\nmodel and represents the key piece of IP within the model.\nM(⋅)\n2.3. Consistency with IFRS 9: Moody’s ImpairmentCalc\nWhile the focus of this paper is the construction of discount curves for reporting liability valuations under IFRS17, some fi rms may be\nconcerned with consistency with reporting impairments under IFRS9. The latest accounting standards for fi nancial instruments require\nthe recognition of expected credit losses based on a forward looking assessment of credit risk. Calculating these expected credit\nlosses is also part of the requirement for adjusting top down IFRS17 discount curves and it is therefore reasonable to expect some\nconsistency between the two estimates.\nThis paper uses a relatively simple methodology to calculate expected losses by combining unconditional EDFs and unconditional\nLGDs. However, for IFRS9 (and CECL) Moody’s offers a more sophisticated approach via our ImpairmentCalc and ImpairmentStudio™\nsolutions. This solution also leverages CreditEdge for EDF estimates, RiskCalc™ for LGD and GCorr™ for correlations between a\nrange of macroeconomic and credit factors. Expected losses are then calculated by taking the unconditional EDF and LGD values and\nconditioning these on a set of macroeconomic scenarios1. By fi rst conditioning EDF and LGD estimates on a set of macro variables,\nwhich are correlated with credit shocks, and then taking a weighted average across these scenarios, this process produces a granular,\nforward-looking and probability weighted estimate of the expected credit loss which takes into account correlations between PD and\nLGD estimates2.\nIn general, this more advanced methodology will produced expected credit losses which differ from the estimates presented in\nthis paper. If full consistency with IFRS9 results is desired, ImpairmentCalc expected credit losses could be used in place of the\nunconditional estimates used here without much diffi culty for either top-down credit risk adjustment or to estimate illiquidity\npremium for bottom-up yield curve construction.\n3. Credit Risk Premium\n3.1. Adjusting the Merton Model’s Drift\nTo estimate the market compensation associated with credit risk we need to adjust the real world probability of default with a credit\nrisk premium. Schematically, we move back from the real world measure to an asset risk neutral measure where the real world implied\ndrift is replaced with the risk free rate. Removing the expected excess return shifts the probability distribution of market value of\nassets at the horizon and thereby increases the probability of default. An increased probability of default is associated with a higher\nspread and the difference between the real world EDF implied spread and the “asset risk neutral” EDF implied spread constitutes our\ncredit risk premium spread.\nNote that the move to the asset risk neutral measure performed here is different from the usual shift from a real world to a risk\nneutral frame, in that case the risk neutral measure is designed to exactly match market prices and risk premia can be directly inferred\nby fi tting our model to market data, in contrast here the shift to the asset risk neutral measure does not account for liquidity risk,\nand so the model spread in this measure will be different from the observed market spread – the residual difference between market\nspreads and asset risk neutral model spreads will be attributed to an illiquidity premium (see section 4.2).\nFigure 4 shows the three measures, real world, asset risk neutral and risk neutral schematically for the Merton model. As we move\nfrom the real world to the asset risk neutral measure the expected asset return decreases and the probability of default, and hence\nspread increases. The pure risk neutral measure, accounting for all risk premia, including illiquidity, has a still further lower expected\n1 See Barnaby Black, Glenn Levine and Juan M. Licari, “Probability-Weighted Outcomes Under IFRS 9: A Macroeconomic Approach”, Moody’s Analytics Risk Perspectices,\nVolume VIII, June 2016\n2 For additional details on PD-LGD correlation see Qiang Meng, Amnon Levy, Andrew Kaplin, Yashan Wang, and Zhenya Hu, “Implications of PD-LGD Correlation in a\nPortfolio Setting.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, February 2010.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 23return and an even higher probability of default and spread. The three measures thus correspond to the expected credit loss spread,\nthe expected loss plus the unexpected credit loss, and fi nally the observed market spread including both credit and illiquidity premia.\nMathematically, we can express the asset risk neutral spread as\nwhere is the cumulative probability of default under the risk neutral measure. We can write the same spread in terms of the\nreal world probability of default as\nCQPD\nwhere we have introduced the Market Price of Risk, , the fi rm’s asset beta, , and the risk premium,\nλ β μA\nThis asset risk neutral spread represents the model value for both the expected credit loss and the credit risk premium combined.\nFigure 4\nAt this stage we could choose to go back to the initial EDF calculations and remove the drift term used to derive the real world default\nprobabilities in order to access a risk neutral credit spread adjustment, however given the real world PDs have been derived using\nan empirical mapping which is calibrated to the real world distance-to-default values, it is not clear that this mapping would still be\nvalid after the drift was removed. Instead, we take the real world EDF data as fi xed inputs and make an independent estimate of the\ncredit risk premium which can be layered upon the EDF without needing to delve into the details of that model. In the next section we\ndescribe our methodology for forming that estimate.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 243.2. Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nIn order to estimate a suitable adjustment to the real world probability of default, we need to determine an appropriate credit risk\npremium. Churm and Paniigirtzoglou (2005) convert an empirically estimated asset risk premium into an equity risk premium by\nconsidering the asset risk premium as a leverage weighted average of the observed market spread and the equity risk premium. We\nfollow a similar approach here, but working in reverse, to estimate an expected excess asset return.\nWeighted average cost of capital is a standard method in corporate fi nance to calculate the cost of capital by combining the cost of\ndebt, cost of equity and a simple measure of the fi rm’s capital structure.\nFor our purposes we need a measure of premium, or the excess return, and so we defi ne our WACC estimate of the risk premium,\n. Using this defi nition the cost of debt becomes the corporate bond spread and the\ncost of equity the appropriate equity risk premium. It is common to also introduce an adjustment to the cost of debt to account for\nmarginal tax relief on debt payments. Combining these elements our WACC risk premium is given by:\nWhere is the leverage, is the equity expected return, is the observed market option adjusted spread, is the risk free rate,\nand as an adjustment for tax relief on debt costs3. For high credit quality fi rms, in benign market conditions, the WACC tends\nPi rE,i OASi rf\nto be dominated by the cost of equity capital, due to the fact that credit spreads are typically signifi cantly lower than the equity risk\nTax\npremium. Note also, that in this model we assume the fi rm pays both a credit risk premia and a liquidity premium to holders of its\ndebt (as both are included in market spread levels).\nThis individual WACC excess return, , for bond calculated using the specifi c fi rm leverage and spread and a constant equity\nrisk premium, can be compared to the return implied by total market spreads, . By rearranging the relationship between spread,\ni\ndefault frequency and expected return from the previous section, the market implied excess return can be written as:\nFigure 4 shows both estimates of asset returns as a function of the asset volatility (left) and fi rm leverage (right), with shown\nin green and shown in light blue. These data are generated for a set of USD investment grade bonds at End June 2018, and use an\nequity risk premium of 4.04%, equal to the equity risk premium for USD equity used in our standard Scenario Generator calibrations4\nand a tax adjustment of 0.8.\nFigure 5 plots the raw data for the asset volatility of each fi rm in the sample against the leverage, naturally this shows a negative\ncorrelation as fi rms which are both highly levered and with a high asset volatility will have a high expected default frequency and are\nunlikely to be rated as investment grade.\n3 A tax adjustment is not strictly required here, but is common practice in the cost of capital accounting literature.\n4 “Real World Calibrations Developed Equities Constant Volatility at End Jun 2018”, Moody’s Analytics Modelling and Calibration Services, July 2018\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 25Figure 5\nFigure 6\nBoth the market implied and WACC excess returns show a positive trend with increasing asset volatility and a negative relation\nwith increasing leverage. The market implied returns account for the entire market observed spread, not just for credit risk, but also\nilliquidity (and any other premia) priced by the corporate debt market, and so are substantially higher than the WACC estimates\nin general, particularly for high asset volatility or low leverage. The WACC estimates of the excess return therefore add a credit risk\npremium which explains part, but not all, of the spread above the default compensation. Given our goal is to decompose the spread\ninto three parts and distinguish credit and non-credit factors, this is promising.\nThe simple WACC estimate shown in Figure 4 uses a constant equity risk premium, making no allowance for fi rm specifi c factors like\nindustry specifi c betas and costs of equity capital. The problems with using a single estimate of the equity risk premium for deriving\nthe WACC can be seen more clearly if the risk premium is converted into a price of risk by dividing by the asset volatility:\nFigure 6 shows the excess returns implied by the market and calculated using the WACC formula, converted into price of risk and\nplotted versus asset volatility (left) and leverage (right). Clearly the market implied data show little systematic relationship between\nthe variables, though there is lower variation in price of risk for higher leverage. In contrast, the constant equity risk premium WACC\nprice of risk is inversely related to asset volatility and increases with leverage. These trends probably indicate systematic fi rm level\ndependencies for the equity risk premia, e.g. higher equity risk premia generally associated with higher asset volatilities and lower\nleverage. At a portfolio level it appears that a constant price of risk, rather than a constant equity risk premium better represents the\ndata.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 26Figure 7\nWe discuss the equity risk premium in more detail in section 4.3.1, but note here that the simple WACC measure presented earlier\nclearly has too little variation (in both its specifi c and systematic behavior). We therefore investigate an alternative approach to\nestimating a WACC based credit risk premium which is better suited to portfolio analysis by leveraging broad market estimates.\nThe individual WACC estimate of the risk premium for each bond in our portfolio could be directly applied, such that the total credit\nspread for both expected default losses and credit risk premium is given by\nwhere indicates the specifi c bond in the portfolio.\nHoweiver, for IFRS 17 the credit risk premium is only required at a portfolio level. What is more, the bond level estimates of credit risk\npremium are noisy, with potential errors introduced in the individual levels estimates of CEDF, LGD, and .\nIn order to defi ne the credit risk premia, then, we defi ne the WACC at the portfolio level, using the portfolio aveσraAges for spread\nand leverage. For a well-diversifi ed portfolio we can more easily defi ne an appropriate expected equity risk premium, based on our\nstandard estimates for equity index excess returns and avoid the need to make detailed assertions about fi rm level expected equity\nreturns.

Results and Discussions\n4.1. Applying the Method to Market Portfolios\nTo analyse the results of the methodology proposed in this paper we apply it to fi ve market portfolios of corporate bonds.\n» Merrill Lynch US High Yield Master II Index\n» Merrill Lynch US Corporate Master Index\n» Merrill Lynch Sterling Corporate Securities Index\n» Merrill Lynch EMU Corporate Index\n» Custom Filtration of ZAR denominated Corporate bonds\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 28For each Merrill Lynch index we take the list of constituent bonds and fi lter any for which there is missing data in CreditEdge. For\nSouth Africa, we take all the fi xed or zero coupon ZAR denominated nominal corporate bonds within CreditEdge. For the SA portfolio\nmost bonds within the database were not rated by Moody’s and so this represents a broad market index across both investment grade\nand high yield.\n4.1.1. US Investment Grade\nThe Merrill Lynch US Corporate Master Index contains 7760 publicly-issued, fi xed-rate, non-convertible, investment grade bonds with\nat least one year to maturity and an outstanding par value of at least $250 million. Of these we found EDF, leverage and LGD data for\n6735 within the CreditEdge database.\nFigure 8 shows the result of applying these estimates of the credit risk premium to calculate the spread adjustment. The fi gure shows\ntwo sets of data one calculated using the fi rst method proposed in Section 3.2, using an individual estimate of the WACC, and one\nusing the second method, where the market implied return is scaled by the portfolio WACC. As predicted the individual WACC spread\nadjustment estimates contain substantially more variation, although the median relationship between credit risk premium and total\nmarket spread, illustrated by the dotted lines, is very similar for each approach.\nTable 1 shows the average spreads across the portfolio for both methods and the decomposition into expected loss and credit risk\npremium spreads. For each method of determining the appropriate credit risk premium, using either the individual WACC or the\nmarket implied return scaled by the portfolio WACC, two methods are presented for taking the average, using either a mean or\nmedian across the portfolio. The mean across the portfolio can be skewed by outliers and the duration weighting of the portfolio,\nwhile the media is more robust in this regard. In general we focus on the relationship between market spread and the credit risk\npremium spread adjustment rather than the absolute value. The preferred metric of the mean portfolio WACC is highlighted in yellow.\nThe table shows that using the individual WACC method the credit risk premium accounts for 48% of the total market spread when\ntaking the mean credit risk premium/mean market spread, while with the portfolio WACC method the credit risk premium accounts\nfor 32% of the spread on the same basis. In comparison the equivalent median data show that the premium explains 35% of the\nfi t using the individual WACC directly and 31% using the market implied return scaled by the portfolio WACC. Note that using the\nportfolio WACC to scale the market implied return the mean and median results, for this portfolio, are almost identical, while using\nthe individual WACC directly produces a more skewed distribution.\nThe table also shows the results of performing least squares fi ts, for mean results, and least absolute deviation fi ts, for median results.\nThe least absolute deviation, median, fi ts are the gradient of the dotted line in Figure 8. The gradients of these fi ts, as expected, are\nalmost identical to taking the simple ratio of the credit risk premium spread to the market spread.\nTable 1\nUS Investment Grade Spreads\nMean Results Median Results\nIndividual WACC Portfolio WACC Individual WACC Portfolio WACC\nMarket Spread 129.3 129.3 123.3 123.3\nExpected Loss Spread 21.2 21.2 13.9 13.9\nCredit risk premium Spread 61.5 41.4 43.7 38.5\nCredit risk premium Spread/Market Spread 0.48 0.32 0.35 0.31\nGradient Fit 0.49 0.33 0.37 0.32\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 29Figure 9\nNote that in Figure 8 there are a number of bonds with a negative market implied excess return, and hence a negative credit risk\npremium spread adjustment when using the market implied return. These are bonds for which the CreditEdge EDF implies a larger\nexpected loss spread than the total observed market spread. In all of these cases the issuer is a state owned enterprise (either from\nChina or Abu Dhabi) where the market spread likely takes into account the expectation of additional, implicit guarantees for which\nthe EDF model does not account. The use of median fi ts above means that these small number of outliers can be left in the sample\nwithout substantially effecting the results and we do not need to manually fi lter the data.\nGiven the breadth of the US portfolio considered here, the fi nal results, using the market implied scaling of the portfolio WACC,\ncan be broken down by sector and rating, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3. These tables show an increasing total spread and credit\nadjustment as ratings lower and a higher spread and credit adjustment for bonds issued by non-fi nancial entities. The proportion\nassigned to each category, expected loss, credit risk premium and illiquidity premium is similar in each case, as expected given the\ntight relationship illustrated in Figure 8.\nTable 2\nUS Average Spreads by Sector\nSpread Expected Loss Credit risk premium Illiquidity Premium\nFinancial 98.1 20.2 30.6 45.3\nNon-Financial 138.9 21.5 44.7 69.5\nTable 3\nUS Average Spreads by Rating\nSpread Expected Loss Credit risk premium Illiquidity Premium\nAAA 85.3 16.2 25.8 41.5\nAA 91.7 19.8 28.6 41.5\nA 106.6 22.0 32.9 49.4\nBBB 148.5 20.9 48.5 75.7\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 304.1.2.

This index contained 2789 publicly\nissued, EUR denominated investment grade bonds at the time of access, of which we had EDF, leverage and LGD data for 1879\nwithin CreditEdge. All bonds have at least one year to maturity and a minimum outstanding of €250m.

Using median estimates the individual WACC explained slightly over 60% of\nthe spread and the portfolio WACC explained around 50%.\nFigure 9 shows the variation in estimates for each bond in the portfolio.

UK Investment Grade\nResults for UK investment grade corporate bonds use the Merrill Lynch Sterling Corporate Index. This index contained 777 publicly\nissued, GBP denominated investment grade bonds at the time of access, of which we had EDF, leverage and LGD data for 496 within\nCreditEdge. All bonds have at least one year to maturity and a minimum outstanding of £100m. Results are calculated using spreads\nover treasuries and use an equity risk premium of 3.40% as in our standard Scenario Generator calibrations and a tax adjustment of\n80%.\nTable 5 below shows mean and median market, expected loss and credit risk premium spreads calculated using either the individual\nWACC credit risk premium or the market implied return scaled by a portfolio WACC. The table shows that using mean estimates\nacross the portfolio the individual WACC credit risk premium explained around 60% of the market spread, while the portfolio WACC\nscaled market implied return explained just under 40%. Using median estimates the individual WACC explained 45-50% of the\nspread and the portfolio WACC explained 36-38%.\nFigure 10 shows the variation in estimates for each bond in the portfolio.

SA Corporate Bonds\nFor South African corporate debt available data within CreditEdge was substantially more limited than for the other portfolios\nconsidered in this paper. Overall we were able to fi nd necessary EDF, LGD, Leverage and volatility data for 62 ZAR denominated\nbonds. Many of these were not rated and the vast majority were from fi nancial organisations, see Figure 11. For SA bonds, LGD data\nwere sourced from Moody’s RiskCalc rather than CreditEdge as this database adjusts for country as well as sector and produced more\nplausible estimates. Results are calculated using spreads over swap rates and use an equity risk premium of 2.89% as in our standard\nScenario Generator calibrations and a tax adjustment of 80%.\nFigure 12\nTable 6 below shows mean and median market, expected loss and credit risk premium spreads calculated using either the individual\nWACC credit risk premium or the market implied return scaled by a portfolio WACC. The table shows that using mean estimates\nacross the portfolio the individual WACC credit risk premium explained around 140% of the market spread, while the portfolio WACC\nscaled market implied return explained just under 70%. Using median estimates the individual WACC explained around 120% of\nthe spread and the portfolio WACC explained 61-68%. These results are noticeably higher than for the EU, US and UK portfolios\nconsidered above, and in particular the individual WACC approach seems to predict a credit risk premium substantially in excess of\nthe total market spread. The portfolio WACC scaled by the market implied return predicts a more reasonable credit risk premium, but\nstill predicts no illiquidity premium over the risk free instruments.\nThese results may be explained by the lower quality of data, and the far smaller sample size of the portfolio, the skew towards banks\nand the likelihood of residual credit and illiquidity risk within the swap curve.\nFigure 12 shows the variation in estimates for each bond in the portfolio. As in previous cases, above, the individual WACC shows\nfar more variation and a more skewed distribution. The dotted lines in the fi gure illustrate the results of the least absolute deviation,\nmedian, fi t to the data.\nTable 6\nSA Corporate Bond Spreads\nMean Results Median Results\nIndividual WACC Portfolio WACC Individual WACC Portfolio WACC\nMarket Spread 183.0 183.0 169.3 169.3\nExpected Loss Spread 71.4 71.4 71.3 71.3\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 33Credit Risk Premium Spread 254.0 120.9 191.1 102.6\nCredit Risk Premium Spread/Market Spread 1.39 0.66 1.13 0.61\nGradient Fit 1.54 0.70 1.28 0.68\nFigure 13\n4.1.5. US High Yield Bonds\nFor high yield US bonds we use the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index. This index tracks dollar denominated publicly issued\ncorporate bonds with a below investment grade rating, at least one year to maturity, fi xed coupons and a minimum outstanding value\nof $250m. At the time of access we recovered 1872 ISINs for constituent bonds, of which we could fi nd leverage, EDF and LGD data\nfor 1394.\nUnlike the portfolios listed above, Moody’s do not produce an estimate of equity risk premium specifi cally for a portfolio of US fi rms\nissuing high yield debt. In order to derive an appropriate cost of capital, there are a number of options.\nFirst the equity risk premium could be assumed to be equal to that used for the US investment grade portfolio.\nSecond, the investment grade ERP could be adjusted to account for the difference in average leverage between the two portfolios, by\nassuming the same unlevered ERP:\nThird, a constant equity market price of risk could be assumed, and the ERP could be rescaled to account for the difference in average\nequity volatility. For the Merton model the equity and asset volatilities are related by\nwhere is the asset value and is the equity. Assuming a constant equity market price of risk implies that\nA E\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 34Ignoring the correction for changes in the value of 5, the adjusted high yield equity risk premium is then\nN(d1)\nFourth, an equity excess return could be inferred by assuming the asset market price of risk to be constant.\nReversing the formula for the cost of capital backs out an implied equity risk premium:\nTable 7 compares a number of statistics for the US investment grade and high yield portfolios considered in this paper. This shows\na slightly higher average leverage and a signifi cant difference in average volatility. The market implied returns show a higher cost of\ncapital for fi rms with a lower credit rating, but a very similar market price of risk when accounting for the difference in estimated asset\nvolatility. This suggests it might also be prudent for us to adjust the estimate of the WACC to account for this difference in volatility.\nTable 7\nComparison of US Investment Grade and High Yield Portfolios\nInvestment Grade High Yield\nAverage Asset Volatility 12.7% 19.1%\nAverage Leverage 38.0% 43.5%\nAverage Spread (bp) 129.3 367.1\nMarket Implied Portfolio Return ( λ_Port^MI ) 5.12% 7.39%\nMarket Implied Portfolio Price of Risk (Λ _Port^MI ) 0.404 0.387\nTable 8 shows the impact of the four methods described above in terms of the implied equity risk premium, the WACC, the\nproportion of the market implied excess return ascribed to credit risk, the average credit risk premium spread and the proportion of\nthe total market spread assigned to the credit risk premium. As expected, if the asset market price of risk is assumed to be constant\nbetween the investment grade and high yield portfolios then the proportion of the total spread explained by the credit risk premium is\napproximately constant, at 32% for both portfolios.\nIf the equity market price of risk is held constant, the higher average spreads for the high yield portfolio lead to a higher credit risk\npremium and a larger proportion of the market spread at 40%. Making no adjustment to the equity risk premium for differences in\nvolatility, leads to a notably lower cost of capital and a smaller proportion of the market spread explained by the credit risk premium,\n23%-25%.\nTable 8\nUS High Yield Bond Equity Return Comparison\nEquity Risk Premium Portfolio WACC Portfolio WACC MPR Portfolio WACC/\nMarket Implied Return\nInvestment Grade ERP 4.04% 3.56% 0.186 48.2%\nRelevered ERP 4.44% 3.78% 0.198 51.2%\n5 From Section 2.1 note that and .

Deriving an Illiquidity Premium\nUnder IFRS 17’s top-down approach to discount rate construction the total yield for the reference portfolio must be adjusted to\nremove the effect of credit risk, both expected losses and a credit risk premium. Assuming the reference portfolio is well matched\nto the associated liabilities, the credit-adjusted yield curve is taken as the appropriate discount curve. In principle there is no need\nto identify any spread over the risk free rate as an illiquidity premium. Using the bottom-up approach, however, there is a need to\nspecifi cally account for liquidity and the methodology described in this paper could be used in order to estimate the associated\nspread.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 36If the total observed market spread is assumed to comprise of only credit risk and illiquidity risk, then the illiquidity premium can be\ndefi ned as the residual after adjusting the total yield for the default spread and the credit risk premium:\nBased upon the results presented in section 4.1 the analysis suggests that the illiquidity premium accounts for around 30%-50% of\nilliquidity premium = marked observed spread - EL - UL.\nthe total spread, depending on the specifi c choice of methodology for the credit risk premium, the choice of risk free basis and the\neconomy under consideration. Figure 14 shows the relationship between the illiquidity premia, defi ned as the residual after credit\nadjustment, and the total market spread for the US investment grade portfolio. The dotted line indicates the least absolute deviation\nlinear fi t to the data.\nFigure 15\nFor a practical implementation of the bottom up approach there are a number of considerations that need to be taken by a fi rm.\nFirstly, should a uniform adjustment be made to the risk free rate to account for illiquidity, or is there a need to estimate a term\nstructure? Given that the method described here is able to estimate total yields and credit adjustments for each individual bond, a\nterm structure for the illiquidity premium could be estimated by directly fi tting to the individual IP estimates, or by applying a scaling\nto the portfolio spread over the appropriate risk free rate.\nSecondly, is the adjustment applied as a point-in-time calculation using a snapshot of market spreads at a given reporting date?\nor should the results be smoothed using historical data to determine either the credit risk premium or the total spread? In the next\nsection we investigate the sensitivity of the results to a number of modelling choices and parameters.\n4.3. Sensitivity to Model Assumptions\nThe results of sections 4.1 and 4.2 show that the WACC model of credit risk premium is able to generate intuitive results and offers a\nplausible route to estimating the credit risk adjustment for IFRS17 discount rate construction.\nHowever, while the model aims to use market observable and implied data where possible, and utilise real world EDF and LGD data in\nwhich we have confi dence, there remain a number of key data inputs which can impact the results. In the sections below we example\nthe sensitivity of the model to two of these, equity risk premium, and the choice of risk free basis.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 374.3.1. Equity Risk Premium\nPerhaps the most important unobservable input to the model is the equity risk premium. Equity risk premia are a matter of\nconsiderable contestation in the fi nancial literature and estimates can vary signifi cantly. Brotherson et al. (2013) report that best\npractice, and by far the most common method, to calculate the equity risk premium for a specifi c fi rm is to use the CAPM. Within\ntheir survey there were a range of sources cited for the source of the market risk premium associated with the CAPM: historical data,\nforward-looking dividend discount model (DDM), Bloomberg and expert judgement among them. These varied sources returned a\nrange of market equity risk premia between 4% and 9%, with a mean around 6.5%.\nWithin Moody’s Analytics we calculate forward looking equity risk premia for country specifi c market indices for use within the\ncalibrations of our Scenario Generator. Our methodology uses the Dimson, Marsh and Staunton historical analysis to set a global\narithmetic risk premia (in excess of cash) of 4%. To calculate risk premia across equity markets we then set a target covariance matrix\nfrom target correlations and volatilities and calculate a vector of coeffi cients as\nΩ β\nwhere is the global portfolio variance and w are a set of weighs based on the observed relative market capitalisations. The\narithmetic risk premium of a specifi c country is then\nThe asset betas for specifi c fi rms could be produced using Moody’s GCorr™ or, alternatively, equity betas could be constructed using\ndata from Bloomberg or Barra (consistent with many responses to Brotherson).\nIn any case, the choice of cost of equity capital (equity risk premium) can make a noticeable impact on the credit risk premium, as\nshown in Figure 15 below, which holds everything else constant and varies the overall market equity risk premium, measuring the\nimpact on the credit risk premium. In this case, for a broad portfolio of USD denominated investment grade bonds, there is a non-\nlinear sensitivity where, at 4% equity risk premium a 1% change in risk premium produce a 14bp change in credit risk premium\nspread.\nFigure 16\nWhilst Moody’s estimates of equity index risk premia are periodically updated, the global arithmetic equity risk premium remains\nrelatively constant over time. As such, the economy specifi c values, particularly for large markets like the US, will vary only to a limited\ndegree. The largest contribution to any change in credit risk premium will therefore come through changes in the expected losses,\nweighted by the leverage, and changes in volatility. The estimate for the credit risk premium may in consequence vary more slowly\nthan total market spreads and the derived illiquidity premia may be more volatile than preferred.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 38The correlation between estimates of the total credit adjustment or liquidity premia and spreads on assets in this structural modelling\napproach depends on the correlations assumed between spreads and the default probabilities and the correlations between spreads\nand the equity risk premia. It is worth noting that if we were to assume a positive historical correlation between spreads and the\nequity risk premia this would produce less volatile estimates of the illiquidity premia and more volatile estimates of the credit risk\npremia. This assumption is therefore a critical one in determining how effectively the illiquidity premia estimate dampens ALM\nvolatility under the IFRS 17 framework.\n4.3.2. Risk Free Rate\nAlthough in principle a top-down approach to discount rate construction under IFRS 17 does not require us to defi ne the risk free\nrate, our proposed approach in this paper, which scales a weighted average cost of capital by market implied returns, does implicitly\ndepend on the choice of risk free basis to defi ne the overall market spreads. These spreads impact both the weighted cost of capital\nitself via the cost of debt, and the market implied returns. The choice of appropriate basis to defi ne these spreads is therefore\nimportant.\nThe text of the IFRS 17 standard states that the risk free rate should refl ect the yield curve in the appropriate currency for instruments\nwith no or negligible credit risk. The question then arises as to whether either swap or treasury instruments exhibit no or negligible\ncredit risk. Both could themselves be adjusted to account for residual credit risk, for example using interbank-OIS spread data, or CDS\nspreads respectively. The standard further states that the liquid risk-free yield curve should then be adjusted to refl ect the difference\nin liquidity between the instruments underlying the observed market rates for the risk free curve and the liquidity of the insurance\ncontracts. Either swap contracts or government bonds could in practice contain some illiquidity premia over a fully liquid risk free rate\nand care should be taken not to double count this premium.\nFor some economies the choice of risk free basis will not have a signifi cant effect, for example, in the US results produced in this\npaper swap/treasury spreads are low. In other economies there can be a substantial swap/government spread and results will vary\ndepending on whether swaps or treasuries are used to defi ne the credit spread, see Table 10 below. Figure 16 shows three spot rate\ncurves for EUR at end June 2018 and illustrates the signifi cant spread between swaps and treasuries. In the case of the Eurozone there\nis the additional complication that there is a single swap rate which crosses many countries each issuing their own government debt\na different rates. The MA EUR government curve shown in the fi gure below is based on a combination of French and German bonds.\nIn addition, where fi rms are valuing liabilities under the Solvency II regime, the discount curve published by EIOPA defi nes a last liquid\npoint at 20 years for EUR, and extrapolates much more quickly from there to an unconditional forward rate than the market data, this\ncan be seen from the difference between the MA and SII data in Figure 16.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 39Figure 17\nFor investment grade debt, during periods of market calm, the WACC is dominated by the cost of equity, which is typically\nsignifi cantly higher than the cost of debt, and so while the credit risk premium will vary depending on the choice of basis, the absolute\nvalue of the average credit risk premium spread is not overly sensitive to the choice, see Table 10 for comparisons. However, during\nperiods of market stress, e.g. during the fi nancial crisis, the difference could be more material. Further, even in periods with low\naverage cost of debt, where the overall WACC does depend more strongly on the choice of basis, the illiquidity premium estimate will\nvary more substantially, as does the proportional relationship between total spread and credit risk premium. Table 10 shows that for\nEUR data at End June 2018 there was nearly a 50bp difference between the median spread over swap rates and the median spread\nover treasuries. The credit risk premium only varied by 7bp, but the illiquidity premium is 40bp lower using the residual over swap\nrates. For the UK there is a swap spread, and illiquidity premia swap spread of around 10bp and for the US the difference between\nbases is even lower.\nTable 10\nRisk Free Basis Comparison\nSWAP Treasury\nSpread Credit risk premium Illiquidity Premium Spread Credit risk premium Illiquidity Premium\nEUR 52.4 44.0 -12.6 99.3 50.9 28.3\nGBP 124.6 49.3 44.9 132.8 48.3 55.5\nUSD 123.3 38.5 63.2 119.2 37.3 61.3\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 405. Conclusion\nCalculation of credit and liquidity adjustments is a complex challenge. Estimates of illiquidity premia can vary substantially depending\non the choice of model and underlying assumptions (Hibbert 2009). Under IFRS 17, the methodology to set discount rates will be\na key challenge. For many insurers the focus will be to ensuring that well matched balance sheets are stable and that P&L results\nare informative of real changes in underlying economic conditions and not simply accounting mismatches (Jessop 2018). Insurers\ntherefore need to be aware of the dangers of artifi cially introducing instability to their results as a consequence of modelling choices\nwhilst still capturing genuine changes in market conditions.\nThis paper lays out one potential method to calculate the necessary total credit adjustment, accounting for both expected loses and\nthe credit risk premium, by leveraging Moody’s experience with credit loss calculations and combining that knowledge and modelling\nwith established cost of capital techniques used in corporate fi nance. The expected loss adjustment considered in this analysis could\neasily be extended to reconcile with the more sophisticated impairment methods used by fi rms for IFRS 9 and CECL.\nWe propose a credit risk premium which starts from an estimate of the weighted cost of capital at the level of the portfolio and scales\nthis for each fi rm using market implied returns. Combining this credit risk premium with an estimate of the asset volatility allows us\nto estimate a spread adjustment and derive an illiquidity premium as the residual of the spread over the risk free rate after adjusting\nfor credit risk. We analysed this method for four economies considering both investment grade and high yield corporate debt and\nconsidered the sensitivity of the results to several of the key model inputs.\nThis paper hopes to show that using a structural model of credit risk could be a useful method to derive discount curves for IFRS\n17 under either the top-down or bottom-up approaches. In practice, some further work may be required to before fi rms commit to\nadopting such an approach. For example we would expect fi rms to want to:\n» Compare the estimated illiquidity premia with alternative benchmarks such as the EIOPA Solvency II Volatility Adjustment\n» To understand the stability over time of results and the sensitivity to changes in market data and assumptions about the time\nvarying behavior of equity risk premium.\n» To potentially enhance the method to reconcile expected losses with IFRS 9 impairment calculations\n» To develop robust methods to apply where data (particularly ratings, or market price) is scarce\n» To extend the analysis to further asset classes, such as government debt, infrastructure and structured loans.\n» Understand the liquidity characteristics of liability contacts and resolve how to transfer an illiquidity premia derived for a portfolio\nof assets to a set of insurance contracts.\nWhile a number of signifi cant open questions need to be addressed when implementing IFRS 17, we believe the methodology\npresented here is promising, not least because it has the potential to be applied to address most of these considerations.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS A COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO ESTIMATING CREDIT RISK PREMIA 416.

The top down approach requires an insurer to build a curve based on their actual asset\nportfolio or a reference portfolio and then adjust the yield on this portfolio by deducting an allowance for credit risk. The insurer also\nneeds to adjust the yield to account for any mismatch between asset and liability cash fl ows. Credit risk within this approach can\nfurther be decomposed into a compensation for expected losses (real world default risk) and a specifi c credit risk premium, which\nrefl ects the uncertainty around expected losses.\nThe bottom up approach requires an insurer to choose fi nancial instruments to refl ect the (liquid) risk free rate and then to fi t a curve\nto those data and then determine an appropriate liability specifi c illiquidity premium to be applied above the risk free curve.\nWhilst in principle both approaches should give the same results, section B84 of the IFRS 17 standard acknowledges that the top\ndown and bottom up calculations may give different answers in practice and do not need to exactly reconcile.\nFigure 1 Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches to IFRS 17 Discount Curve Construction\nExpected credit losses\nCredit Risk premium\nfor unexpected losses\nYield Curve\nTop Down Mismatch adjustment Bottom Up\nbased on actual\nor reference\nIlliquidity premium\nportfolio.\nIFRS 17 Discount\nRate\nRisk Free Rate.\nThere are related, but distinct, challenges to both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down the primary questions relate\nto estimating the credit risk premium and the selection of an appropriate reference portfolio. Bottom-up the standard states that\nthe illiquidity premium applied must refl ect the liquidity characteristics of the insurance product being valued, determining the\nappropriate liquidity characteristics and mapping these to asset data where the illiquidity premium can be estimated is a key task\nfor this approach. The liquid risk-free rate also needs to be defi ned for a bottom-up approach, we discuss this point in more detail on\npage page 49.\nMethodology overview\nWithin this report we follow the top-down structural method defi ned in our previous white paper Thompson and Jessop (2018) to\ncalculate the credit risk premium and to decompose market spreads into three components: 1) expected losses from defaults 2)\nUnexpected losses (credit risk premium) and 3) illiquidity premium. The derived illiquidity premia are then presented in a form where\nthey could be applied bottom-up.\nOur method uses a Merton-style structural model of credit risk to calculate fair value spreads based on a combination of real world\nprobabilities of default, estimated at an individual fi rm level, sectoral estimates of loss given default and a weighted cost-of-capital\nadjustment for credit risk premium. This method leverages Moody’s Analytics CreditEdge™ expected default frequency (EDF™) model\nof real world probability of default. CreditEdge EDFs are an industry recognized standard for point-in-time probability of default,\nplease refer to Nazeran and Dwyer (2015) for more detail of the EDF model.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 45The forward looking nature of the EDF estimates is well aligned to recent developments in the IFRS standards, in particular the IFRS 9\nimpairment methodologies which were introduced as a response to ‘too little too late’ during the fi nancial crisis (Zhang, 2018). EDFs\nare procyclical estimates of credit risk, and will also drive a proportionately procyclical estimate of the credit risk premia using our\nmethod. This means that all three components of spread changes (expected losses, credit risk premium and illiquidity premia) are all\nexpected to be positively correlated with market spread changes when using the method outlined. Understanding and being able to\nprovide robust justifi cation for this aspect of the IFRS 17 yield curve calibrations is likely to be a critical component of a successful and\nacceptable implementation of the standards.\nMethodology Considerations\nCredit risk adjustment\nIn brief, the structural model of credit risk employed in our method calculates a fi rm’s credit risk by treating the traded equity of\nthe fi rm as a call option on the fi rm’s assets, with a strike price given by the default point, where the fi rm’s assets cannot cover\nits liabilities. By modelling the value of the fi rm’s assets with a stochastic process, a geometric Brownian motion, the real-world\nprobability of default can be calculated at a given horizon, dependent on the leverage or the fi rm, the expected return on the fi rm’s\nassets and the asset volatility. The fi nal real world probability of default is calculated using an empirical mapping based on a database\nof historical defaults.\nMathematically, the compensation for expected credit losses is given by combining the real world probability of default with the\nrecovery rate, or loss given default:\nwhere is the duration matched cumulative probability of default for a given bond and is the loss given default for that\nissuer’s industrial sector, a parameter also derived from CreditEdge.\nCPDi i LGDi\nThe unexpected loss is then calculated by adjusting the real world probability of default to account for a credit risk premium. This\ncredit risk premium is calculated based on a cost-of-capital approach, assuming that the expected return on a fi rm’s assets is related\nto the leverage weighted cost of capital for that fi rm. We say the cost of capital is given by\nwhere the cost of debt is derived from the corporate bond spread and the cost of equity is the equity risk premium.\nThe cost of capital is estimated at a portfolio level, where we can more easily determine an average equity risk premium, and then\nscaled using a portfolio beta to get the credit risk premium for a given issuer. The portfolio betas are estimated using the market\nimplied returns for the overall portfolio and each individual issuer.\nThe total credit adjustment is then the sum of the expected credit loss spread and the unexpected credit loss due to the credit risk\npremium.\nBy defi ning the observed market spread as the sum of expected loss, unexpected loss and illiquidity premium, the implied illiquidity\npremium can then be backed out as the residual of the market spread minus the total credit adjustment\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 46Rating and Sector Breakdown\nWithin each economy we break down the estimate of the credit risk premium and the implied illiquidity premium for each bond\nrating for which there is suffi cient data and across ratings between fi nancial and non-fi nancial issuers. As the leverage and volatility\ncharacteristics of fi rms vary signifi cantly between sectors our cost-of-capital adjustment should also vary between these categories.\nTo do this we follow the method described in Thompson and Jessop (2018) to adjust the equity risk premium assuming a constant\nasset price of risk. The market implied returns indicate that this is a more reasonable quantity to hold constant as leverage and\nvolatility change than the equity risk premium itself and the results quoted in this report are more intuitive when this adjustment is\nperformed.\nReference Portfolio Construction\nAs a principles based approach, IFRS 17 allows fi rms freedom to choose reference portfolios aligned to their own business lines and\nproducts. In theory insurers could choose to set a distinct reference portfolio for each line of business or separate product type,\nrefl ecting the difference in liquidity characteristics between each liability. Alternatively insurers may wish to use a single reference\nportfolio and scale top-down curves or illiquidity premia derived from it as appropriate to each liability.\nThe composition of the reference portfolio will be crucial and there does not yet appear to be consensus in the industry on how this\nshould be constructed, or on whether the portfolio should represent the actual assets used to back the relevant liabilities.\nSome insurers (particularly the UK bulk annuity players) will be looking to derive a discount rate curve which, at least partially,\nrefl ects an illiquid asset portfolio. Much of the analysis on illiquidity premia, including within this report, relates to corporate bonds.\nExtending this to illiquid assets such as infrastructure debt or real estate loans increases the challenge. Moody’s Analytics are looking\nat ways to leverage the credit expertise and data which exists within the company to assist with this task. This is likely to be a more\nsignifi cant issue where an insurer has chosen to use their actual assets as the reference portfolio.\nThe choice of reference portfolio is not only a concern for a top-down approach to discount curve construction, however, even for\nbottom-up insurers need to understand the liquidity characteristics of liability contacts and resolve how to transfer an illiquidity\npremia derived for a portfolio of assets to a set of insurance contracts. An obvious starting point for many insurers may be the old\nQIS5 “bucketing” approach, where for example annuities were allocated 100% of the premium, with-profi ts 75% and unit-linked\n50%. A more sophisticated approach may be to examine the underlying liability cashfl ows and quantify their predictability, thereby\ndetermining how much of the illiquidity premium on the backing assets could realistically be earned by holding assets to maturity. In\neither case, the choice of backing assets is still key: it is no use to know that the liabilities should apply 75% of the premium on the\nassets without knowing to which assets this refers.\nExtrapolation and Interpolation\nWithin the standard for IFRS 17 the method for interpolating and extrapolating market data is not specifi ed, though the standard does\nrequire that all appropriate and relevant market data are included. That, however, cannot be our only guiding principle.\nWhen performing our standard Scenario Generator calibrations there are a number of core principles we value in constructing\nappropriate yield curves:\n1. Accuracy: liquid markets should be accurately priced\n2. Continuity: the forward curve should be continuous.\n3. Smoothness: the forward curve should be smooth, i.e. the fi rst derivative should be continuous.\n4. Neutrality where data is missing: avoid extrapolating or interpolating spurious features or views (such as oscillations, humps, or\nbumps).\nAs in the IFRS 17 standard we fi rst need to ensure that relevant market data are accurately priced, but to that we also add\nconsiderations that the calibrated curves should be continuous, smooth and without spurious variation.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 47Moody’s Analytics standard calibrations use a cubic spline Nelson-Siegel (CSNS) algorithm to interpolate and extrapolate market\ndata. This method proceeds by selecting a set of knot points, optimising forward rates at these knot points to satisfy an objective\nfunction and fi nally matching gradients at the last knot point to extrapolate to a specifi ed ultimate forward rate (UFR) using a\nNelson-Siegel form.\nIn order to follow our third and fourth core principles several penalty terms are added to the objective function, which control the fi nal\ngradient of the forward rate curve and the smoothness of the fi rst and second gradients. As standard the number of knot points scales\nwith the square root of the number of fi tting data, but caps at 12.\nWhen fi tting to corporate bond data, instead of swap rates or government bonds, the calibration is more challenging: due to\ndifferences in credit risk corporate bonds display far more variation in yields to maturity then the equivalent risk free instruments.\nIn order to achieve smoother and more neutral fi tted curves, the calibrations in this report relax the constraint on the number of knot\npoints but also increase the second derivative smoothing penalty compared to our standard calibrations. Figure 2 shows a comparison\nof the two calibration parameter sets for GBP investment grade corporate bonds at end December 2018. Where market data is\nrelatively sparser, generally at longer maturities, calibrated yield curves can be sensitive to individual points and if knot points are\nspaced too widely can produce unintuitive forward rate curves. Note that whilst the forward rates are noticeably different between\ncalibrations, the model yields are very similar.\nFigure 2 Alternative Calibrations for GBP Corporate Bonds at End Dec 2018\n(Left) Forward Rates, Knot Points Marked with Circles. (Right) Bond Yields\nThe IFRS 17 standard does not prescribe the extrapolation method, nor any choice of last liquid points (LLP) or UFR. Some fi rms may\nwish to use the Smith-Wilson method. This method is not well suited to fi tting to large sets of data with substantial variation, i.e.\nto raw corporate bonds as used in this report, however, fi rms could fi rst smooth corporate bond yields with a cubic spline, and then\nfi t the fi nal curve and extrapolation using Smith-Wilson. Other fi rms may wish to simply extrapolate using constant forward rates\nwithout setting an explicit UFR target; this avoids the need to set an assumption for unconditional illiquidity premia, but may result in\nless stable long term curves. In this report we use Nelson-Siegel extrapolated to our standard swap UFR for all calibrations but report\nonly the fi rst 30 years.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 48Risk-Free Basis\nFor any IFRS 17 discount rate methodology which follows the bottom-up approach, the choice of risk-free basis is essential. Within\nour top-down approach to calculating credit risk premia, however, the choice of risk-free rate can also impact the fi nal results. The\ntotal credit risk adjustment is weakly dependent on the choice of risk-free rate through a change in spread component of the cost-of-\ncapital. By changing the underlying basis the spread level, and hence the credit risk premium, or unexpected loss adjustment, will vary.\nFor some economies there is a signifi cant difference between the swap and government curves. Figure 3 shows the difference\nbetween Moody’s standard SG calibration for Germany at end December 2018, alongside the offi cial EIOPA SII curve at the same\ndate. In periods of market stress this can become even more pronounced; Figure 4 shows the one year LIBOR spread for Germany, UK\nand US from 1997 to 2017.\nIn principle, the “risk-free” curve may need adjustment itself. Either swap contracts or government bonds could in practice contain\nsome illiquidity premia over a fully liquid risk-free rate. Both LIBOR and treasury rates could be adjusted to account for residual\ncredit risk, for example using interbank-OIS spread data, or CDS spreads. Directly using OIS swap data might provide the most robust\nestimate of a truly risk-free yield curve.\nFigure 3 Government and Swap Spot Rates for Germany at End Dec 2018\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 49Figure 4 One Year Swap Spread For Selected Economies\nWithin this report we have used unadjusted government rates as the reference liquid risk-free rates against which to defi ne the\nimplied illiquidity premia. Whilst insurers wishing to align their IFRS 17 balance sheet with Solvency II may wish to start from swap\nrates, doing so would require understanding the current swap spreads and performing appropriate adjustments to understand the\ndecomposition of that spread otherwise unintuitive results for the corporate bond decomposition could be produced.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 50Results\nEUR\nTop-down credit risk adjusted yield curves are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 fi rstly for a composite portfolio of 1585 investment\ngrade corporate bonds and secondly split by rating. In Figure 5 the fi t to the raw yields is shown alongside the fi tted yield curves\nproduced after adjusting the yield to maturity on each bond for the expected credit loss and after removing the credit risk premium.\nThe CRP adjusted curve represents the top-down curve for that portfolio. For reference Moody’s Analytics standard calibration for\nGerman government bonds is also shown. Figure 6 shows the fi tted yield curve for portfolios of AA, A and BBB rated corporate bonds\nusing both the raw market yields (solid lines) and after removing credit risk (dotted lines), the latter represent the top down curves for\nthose portfolios. Average characteristics of the bonds, by rating, are presented in Table 1.\nImplied illiquidity premia per rating class can be derived by calculating the spread of the top-down curves over the government curve:\nthese are presented in Figure 7. Average illiquidity premia per rating and maturity bucket are presented in Table 2. Figure 8 shows\na regression of the excess spread, defi ned as the market spread at end Dec18 minus the expected credit loss, versus the implied\nilliquidity premia for each bond, this regression allows us to derive an average relationship between spreads and illiquidity premia,\nthese proxy coeffi cients are listed in Table 3. These numbers could be compared to SII where EIOPA defi ne the VA as 65% of the\ncredit-adjusted spread (referred to as the fundamental spread).\nFinally data are split into fi nancial and non-fi nancial categories. Figure 9 shows the unadjusted (solid) and credit adjusted (dotted)\ntop-down yield curves for each category. Figure 10 displays the implied illiquidity premia for each category. Table 4 presents the\naverage implied illiquidity premia per category and maturity bucket. Although the unadjusted market yields are similar for both\nfi nancial and non-fi nancial corporate bonds, there is a signifi cant difference in the implied illiquidity premia.\nFinancial bonds have a signifi cantly higher probability of default and expected loss than non-fi nancial bonds (an average of 37 bp\nfor fi nancials to 17 bp for non-fi nancial corporate bonds), this is consistent with the EIOPA VA and MA calculations where fi nancial\nbonds generally have higher fundamental spreads. Driving this change, Figure 12 shows that fi nancial issuers have higher leverage and\nlower asset volatility than non-fi nancial issuers, these factors affect both the EDF and the credit risk premium. Table 1 also shows that\nfi nancial issuers have a higher average credit rating, and the analysis per rating shows that a higher rating leads to lower illiquidity\npremia.\nData in all fi gures and tables are quoted as percentages except where stated otherwise.\nTable 1 EUR Bond Characteristics\nRATING NUMBER OF BONDS AVERAGE YIELD TO AVERAGE DURATION FINANCIAL\nMATURITY PROPORTION\nAll bonds 1585 1.08 % 4.80 25%\nAAA 7 0.88 % 7.77 0\nAA 163 0.57 % 4.45 57%\nA 581 0.89 % 5.05 31%\nBBB 834 1.31 % 4.67 15%\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 51TOP-DOWN YIELD CURVES\nFigure 5 Credit Risk Adjusted Yield Curves Figure 6 Credit Risk Adjusted Yield Curves\nEUR End Dec 2018 – All Investment Grade Bonds EUR End Dec 2018\nILLIQUIDITY PREMIA\nFigure 7 Implied Illiquidity Premia Figure 8 Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread\nEUR End Dec 2018 EUR End Dec 2018\nTable 2 Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY -> 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\n/RATING\nAAA 3 15 42 53\nAA 10 10 15 19\nA 26 31 40 52\nBBB 55 66 93 117\nAll Bonds 41 46 67 81\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 52Table 3 Illiquidity Premia Proxy Coeffi cients1\nMATURITY -> AVERAGE EXPECTED IP PROPORTION\n/RATING LOSS SPREAD (BP)\nAAA 4.3 0.56\nAA 24.1 0.20\nA 22.1 0.38\nBBB 22.4 0.60\nAll Bonds 22.4 0.51\nSECTORAL ANALYSIS\nFigure 9 Financial and Non-Financial Yield Curves Figure 10 Financial and Non-Financial Implied Illiquidity Premia\nEUR End Dec 2018 EUR End Dec 2018\nFigure 11 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread Figure 12 Financial and Non-Financial Leverage\nEUR End Dec 2018 EUR End Dec 2018\n1 Coeffi cients should be interpreted as the intercept and slope, e.g. for EUR all bonds:\nIP = 0.51 * (Spread - 22.4 bp)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 53Table 4 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY -> 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\n/RATING\nNon-Financial 44 51 74 87\nFinancial 27 31 40 42\nAll Bonds 41 46 67 81\nGBP\nTop-down credit risk adjusted yield curves are shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14, fi rstly for a composite portfolio of 413 investment\ngrade corporate bonds and secondly split by rating.

Although the unadjusted market yields are similar for both\nfi nancial and non-fi nancial corporate bonds, there is a signifi cant difference in the implied illiquidity premia. Unlike other economies\nin this report HKD fi nancial bonds have a higher illiquidity premia than non-fi nancial bonds.\nFinancial bonds have a slightly lower probability of default and expected loss than non-fi nancial bonds (an average of 27 bp to 35\nbp), this is in contrast to other economies examined here. Despite this difference, Figure 50 shows that as across other economies,\nfi nancial issuers have higher leverage and lower asset volatility than non-fi nancial issuers, these factors affect both the EDF and the\ncredit risk premium. Implied illiquidity premia, in particular for non-fi nancial bonds, show a downward trend with maturity. This is\nlikely driven by the limited availability of government bond data and the early point at which extrapolation begins: HK government\nbond data in Moody’s Analytics standard calibrations ends around 10 years, while corporate bond data extends to 30 years. The low,\nor negative, implied illiquidity premia are perhaps an indication that the risk-free curve extrapolates towards the UFR too quickly.\nTable 21 HKD Bond Characteristics\nRATING NUMBER OF BONDS AVERAGE YIELD TO AVERAGE DURATION FINANCIAL\nMATURITY PROPORTION\nAll bonds 395 3.07% 4.34 55%\nTOP-DOWN YIELD CURVES\nFigure 44 Credit Risk Adjusted Yield Curves\nHKD End Dec 2018\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 66ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA\nFigure 45 Implied Illiquidity Premia Figure 46 Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread\nHKD End Dec 2018 HKD End Dec 2018\nTable 22 Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\nAll Bonds 27 27 24 26\nTable 23 Illiquidity Premia Proxy Coeffi cients\nMATURITY AVERAGE EXPECTED IP PROPORTION\nLOSS SPREAD (BP)\nAll Bonds 29.7 0.31\nSECTORAL ANALYSIS\nFigure 47 Financial and Non-Financial Yield Curves Figure 48 Financial and Non-Financial Implied Illiquidity Premia\nHKD End Dec 2018 HKD End Dec 2018\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 67Figure 49 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia vs Excess Spread Figure 50 Financial and Non-Financial Leverage\nHKD End Dec 2018 HKD End Dec 2018\nTable 24 Financial and Non-Financial Illiquidity Premia in Basis Points per Annum\nMATURITY -> 1-3 3-5 5-10 10+\n/RATING\nNon-Financial 15 17 11 11\nFinancial 38 33 31 32\nAll Bonds 27 27 24 26\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 68Conclusion\nThe results presented in this report are an attempt to provide a market data driven, structural approach to determining appropriate\ncomponents for either a top-down or bottom-up approach to constructing discount curves for use under IFRS 17. The modelling\nleverages Moody’s Analytics substantial experience in expected credit loss modelling alongside standard accounting techniques to\ndetermine a cost-of-capital adjustment for credit risk premia.\nThe IFRS 17 standard states that discount curves, whether produced bottom-up or top-down, should relate to the liquidity\ncharacteristics of a fi rm’s own liabilities. As such, we do not believe that it likely that a standard discount curve can be defi ned which\nis appropriate to all insurers. Instead, we aim to provide standard components which can be utilised to derive an appropriate discount\nrate for any business. In order to determine the appropriate liability discount rate, a mapping will have to be performed between\nspecifi c insurance contracts and market traded assets. As we have shown in this report, the choice of portfolio can have a signifi cant\nimpact on the fi nal discount rate; the implied illiquidity premia for different ratings of corporate bonds are substantially different. This\nis an essential consideration for both top-down and bottom-up approaches.\nThe method used in this report provides a straightforward application to break down estimates of illiquidity premia by rating and\nsector. We have focussed on corporate bonds, but the methodology could be extended to other asset classes if probability of default,\nrecovery rate and cost-of-capital assumptions are available. The specifi c illiquidity premia for each asset class can then be combined\nappropriately for any reference portfolio to derive a fi nal discount rate.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 69Appendix: Additional Data Tables References\nTable 25 Settings » IFRS Foundation, IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts—the accounting model in one page, 2018\nEconomy Equity Risk Premium Rating Source Targeted Ratings Base Risk Free Rate » Jessop, Nick “IFRS 17 Discount Rates”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2018\nCAD 3.40% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB CAD Treasury\n» Nazeran, Pooya and Douglas Dwyer “Credit Risk Modeling of Public Firms: EDF9”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2015\nCNY 4.61% EDF-Implied AA, A, BBB, BB CNY Treasury\n» Robinson, Peter and Harry Hibbert “Calibrating G2 Dual Term Premium Credit Model using Bond Spreads and EDFs”, Moody’s\nEUR 4.43% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB DEM Treasury\nAnalytics White Paper, 2019\nGBP 3.41% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB GBP Treasury\n» Thompson, Alasdair and Nick Jessop “A Cost of Capital Approach to Estimating Credit Risk Premia”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper,\nHKD 4.94% Moody’s SRA AA, A, BBB HKD Treasury\n2018\nUSD 4.04% Moody’s SRA AAA, AA, A, BBB USD Treasury\n» Zhang, Jing “The new Impairment Model under IFRS 9 and CECL”, Risk Books, 2018\nTable 26 Estimated ERP by Rating\nEconomy AAA AA A BBB BB\nCAD N/A 2.49% 3.68% 3.57% N/A\nCNY N/A 3.54% 3.59% 3.32% 5.18%\nEUR N/A 4.31% 4.36% 4.51% N/A\nGBP N/A 3.59% 3.44% 3.41% N/A\nHKD N/A 3.79% 5.52% 4.72% N/A\nUSD 4.01% 3.57% 3.81% 4.30% N/A\nTable 27 Estimated ERP by Sector\nEconomy Financial Non-Financial\nCAD 1.67% 3.74%\nCNY 3.66% 6.67%\nEUR 1.60% 4.73%\nGBP 0.91% 3.87%\nHKD 2.91% 5.93%\nUSD 2.17% 4.35%\nBP57816\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 70 MOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 71References\n» IFRS Foundation, IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts—the accounting model in one page, 2018\n» Jessop, Nick “IFRS 17 Discount Rates”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2018\n» Nazeran, Pooya and Douglas Dwyer “Credit Risk Modeling of Public Firms: EDF9”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2015\n» Robinson, Peter and Harry Hibbert “Calibrating G2 Dual Term Premium Credit Model using Bond Spreads and EDFs”, Moody’s\nAnalytics White Paper, 2019\n» Thompson, Alasdair and Nick Jessop “A Cost of Capital Approach to Estimating Credit Risk Premia”, Moody’s Analytics White Paper,\n2018\n» Zhang, Jing “The new Impairment Model under IFRS 9 and CECL”, Risk Books, 2018\nBP57816\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS ILLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT PREMIA FOR IFRS 17 AT END DECEMBER 2018 71IFRS 17 Series IFRS 17 Credit and Illiquidity Premia Sensitivity\nOCTOBER 2019 and Backtesting\nAuthors\nExecutive Summary\nAlasdair Thompson\nAny methodology to set credit and illiquidity premia for the purpose of defi ning liability\nNick Jessop\ndiscount curves must be able to produce coherent and stable results over time to be\nMoody’s Analytics Research\nof practical use for insurers.

The standard does not prescribe the method by which this discount curve is calculated, but does offer\ngeneral principles for constructing a curve by either a “bottom-up” or “top-down” method. In a previous white paper (Thompson\nand Jessop 2018), we offered one method by which this calculation could be performed by using Moody’s Analytics Expected Default\nFrequency (EDF™) model of real world defaults to calculate credit adjustments on a portfolio of corporate bonds. Although this\nmethod can be most easily classifi ed as a top-down approach to calculating the discount curve, we believe the implied illiquidity\npremia that can be derived using our method are also applicable to insurers following a bottom-up approach.1 A follow-up paper\n(Thompson and Jessop 2019) applied this method to a range of economies across Europe, Asia, and North America and calculated\ncredit risk and illiquidity premia, showing how this could be decomposed across ratings, sectors, and maturities.\nFor a method to be of practical use by insurers, it must produce sensible and interpretable results over time, and it must understand\nchanges in the decomposition of market spreads between credit and illiquidity risk. Recently, a number of works have shown that the\nassumptions made about discount rates and how they are applied can have signifi cant implications for an insurer’s balance sheet,\nfuture profi ts, and volatility (Conn 2019, Morrison 2019).\nIn this paper, we calculate the sensitivity of the implied illiquidity premium to a range of stresses to underlying data that we input into\nour model. We then analyze the historic correlations between these risk factors and fi nally perform a full backtest of the model for a\nselected range of dates and economies.2\n1 Indeed, since illiquidity premia are not something that can be observed directly on the market, we believe that most bottom-up calculations will need to use\na hybrid method where the cost of liquidity is derived from a top-down analysis. The volatility adjustment under Solvency II could be seen as one such hybrid\nmethod where the volatility adjustment is derived by EIOPA by making a credit adjustment to a top-down portfolio, but it is then applied bottom-up by insurers\nby adding it to a risk-free curve.\n2 For the purposes of this paper, we use dates and economies for which we already hold data as part of our standard ESG calibration process.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 74Stress Sensitivity Analysis\nUnderstanding the sensitivity of the credit and illiquidity premia to changes in the underlying risk drivers allows us to gain confi dence\nin the model and to predict how it will behave under different market conditions. We conduct a simple sensitivity analysis of our\ncredit risk model by stressing each of the core risk factors in turn on a univariate basis and examining how the average implied\nilliquidity premia across a portfolio of corporate bonds moves under each test.\nA series of multiplicative stresses are applied to each variable, so that for every bond in a given sample, the same multiplicative\nstress is applied—for example, every EDF increases by 10%. For each stress scenario, we run the portfolio of bonds through our credit\nadjustment algorithm to determine the stressed cost-of-capital, stressed market implied returns, and stressed credit risk premia. The\nlinear sensitivity to the stress is then calculated as the gradient of the implied illiquidity premia versus the stressed risk factor. The\nresults of univariate stresses to spread, EDF, loss given default (LGD), and equity risk premium (ERP) are shown in Table 1. These should\nbe interpreted as saying that a 10 bp increase in average spread levels will lead to around a 9 bp increase in illiquidity premium, while\na 10 bp increase in LGD will lead to a 0.1-0.3 bp decrease in illiquidity premium.\nTable 1 Stress sensitivities for implied illiquidity premia to underlying risk factors\nUSD CAD EUR AUD GBP HKD CNY SEK\nSpread 94% 92% 92% 86% 87% 96% 92% 89%\nEDF -16% -27% -23% -13% -16% -19% -20% -13%\nLGD -1% -1% -2% -2% -2% -3% -2% -1%\nERP -11% -11% -14% -10% -15% -14% -6% -10%\nNote that all calculations presented here are in terms of the residual illiquidity premia on an asset portfolio. The sensitivity of the fi nal illiquidity premium applied to\ndiscount liabilities under a bottom-up approach would be multiplied by an application ratio that refl ected the difference in liquidity characteristics between the\nasset and liability instuments. This could dampen the impact of changes in the underlying risk factors (assuming the application ratio was less than one).\nHigh sensitivity to spreads, where everything else is kept constant, makes intuitive sense for our model: a change to spreads will not\naffect the expected loss and will change the unexpected loss only through an increase in the cost-of-capital, which in current market\nconditions is dominated by the equity term.3 Hence, most of the impact of a spread stress is passed through to the implied illiquidity\npremium. The sensitivity to spread changes will be of particular importance when considering the impact of a change in risk-free basis—\nfor example, between government and swap rates or between inter-bank offered rates and overnight indexed swaps. The high sensitivity\nto spread changes indicates that the change in IP from a change in risk-free basis will be very close to the average basis spread.\nIn contrast, the relatively low sensitivities to other risk drivers may be less obvious. We can estimate the correct sensitivity by\nexamining the formula for the expected loss:\nCalculating the partial derivatives of this expression gives the sensitivities of the expected loss. To fi rst order in EDF:\n3 Within our model we use a weighted average cost-of-capital (WACC) which is given by the leverage weighted sum of the cost-of-debt and cost-of-equity:\nWACC=Leverage • Cost of Debt+(1-Leverage) • Cost of Equity. The cost-of-debt and cost-of-equity are, respectively, taken to be the average bond spread across\nthe portfolio and the equity risk premium.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 75Plugging in the average duration and LGD for the USD portfolio gives a sensitivity for the expected loss of around 7%. If the\nunexpected loss changes by a similar level, then the total sensitivity for the illiquidity premium should be approximately given by:\nInserting the average values for the USD portfolio gives an illiquidity premium sensitivity to LGD of -1.3% and a EDF sensitivity of\n-19%, both very close to the empirical results in Table 1.\nNote that within our calibrations, the global equity risk premium is always 4%. Individual economy equity risk premia will change over time, but the movements will\nnot be large. We include the sensitivity to the choice of equity risk premia here for completeness.\nFinally, the variation in sensitivity between different economies refl ects the point-in-time nature of these sensitivity results. It also\nshows the fact that each sensitivity depends on the levels of both the variables under consideration (the relationship between the\nindependent and dependent variables is not necessarily linear) and the level of the other variables: when the EDF is higher, the\nsensitivity to LGD will be higher, and vice versa.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 76Historic Correlations\nThe sensitivity analysis in the previous section revealed how the credit and illiquidity premia vary in response to univariate changes in\nthe underlying risk drivers. In reality, however, these risk drivers are far from independent. In practice the EDF will be correlated with\nspreads and is directly driven by changes in leverage and volatility. Figure 1 shows a strong correlation between average 1-year EDF\nand spreads (in particular, the fi gure shows 5-7 year A rated spreads, though spreads themselves show a high correlation across ratings\nand maturities), but the correlation is signifi cantly less pronounced for longer-term default probabilities.4 Note that the average EDF\nterm structure actually inverts around the fi nancial crisis in 2009, with 1-year default probabilities higher than 5- or 10-year. The 10-\nyear EDF in particular is, on average, almost completely constant over time.\nFigure 1 Average EDF at 1-, 5-, and 10-year horizons for US issuers alongside USD 5-7 year A rated spreads.\nFor other economies there is a similar effect. Table 2 shows the correlations between mean 1- or 5-year annualized EDF and year A 5-7\nspreads for a range of economies.\nTable 2 Correlation between 5-7 year A rated spreads and annualized monthly EDF\nEUR GBP USD\n1 Year EDF 65% 29% 83%\n5 Year EDF 22% -3% 79%\nChanges in EDF are not strongly correlated with changes in spread over short time periods, but generally a stronger correlation\nis observable when considered over longer time periods: for example, correlation between log changes in EDF and log changes in\nspreads over 1, 3, 6, or 12 months are listed in Table 3. Figure 2 shows the time series of annual log changes in 1-, 5-, and 10-year\nEDF compared to year A 5-7 spreads. There is a signifi cant correlation between changes in 1-year EDF and spreads, but very little\ncorrelation for longer-term EDF. Notably there is also a lag between changes in spreads and changes in EDF, with annual log changes\nto mean 1-year EDF correlating most highly with spreads at a lag of 2-4 months. Log changes to 5-year EDF have a less consistent\noptimal lag and a lower correlation.\n4 Moody’s Analytics EDF model estimates a term structure for default probability at horizons from 1 to 10 years. Over the short term, default frequency is driven\nby both idiosyncratic and systemic factors, while over the longer term idiosyncratic risk dominates, giving a more acyclical result and a more stable probability\nof default. See Nazeran and Dwyer (2015).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 77Table 3 Correlation between log changes over different periods for 5-7 year A rated spreads and 1-year EDF\nEUR GBP USD\n1 Month Change 38% 20% 46%\n3 Month Change 48% 29% 55%\n6 Month Change 56% 34% 65%\n12 Month Change 59% 37% 73%\nFigure 2 Annual log changes in average EDF for US issuers and USD 5-7 year A rated spreads\nAt an individual issuer level, the 1-year and 5-year EDF are highly correlated, refl ecting the nature of the EDF term structure model.\nHowever, at an aggregated level the correlation is less pronounced, given the greater infl uence of systematic risk factors within the\nmodel at one year than at fi ve years. Figure 3 shows the variation over time of 1-year EDF (left) and 5-year EDF (right) for a random\nsample of 100 issuers (grey) plus the average across all issuers (red).\nFigure 3 EDF for selected US issuers and average US issuer at 1-year horizon (left) and 5 years (right)\nThese fi gures show that 1-year EDF varies substantially over time, across several orders of magnitude for individual issuers and over\none order of magnitude at an aggregated, average level. At both an individual issuer level and on average variation is much lower for\n5-year EDF.5\n5 At the individual issuer level, the 1-year EDF has a standard deviation around 80% of the mean. This compares to just 38% of the mean value for the 5-year\nEDF. At the aggregated, average level the 1-year EDF still has a standard deviation of 60% of the mean, while the average 5-year EDF has only a standard\ndeviation of 17% of the mean. All data is for US issuers.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 78The EDF model itself is driven by a number of risk factors, primarily leverage and volatility. As volatility is calculated over a 3-year\nrolling window, and does not vary rapidly over time for a given fi rm (though it does vary between sectors, for example, between\nfi nancial and non-fi nancial fi rms), at an aggregated level the main driver for changes in the average EDF will be market leverage.6\nFigure 4 shows the time series for market leverage and asset volatility for a random sample of US issuers (grey) alongside the mean\nacross all US issuers (red). As expected, while there is noticeable variation between issuers for volatility, for any given issuer or for the\naverage there is little variation over time. Leverage shows slightly higher variation over time for any given issuer but even less variation\non average, even though there is widespread variation between issuers.7\nFigure 4 Leverage (left) and volatility (right) for selected US issuers and average US issuer\nRecovery Rate\nThe credit and illiquidity premia will also depend on the assumptions made about recovery rates and in the previous section we\ncalculated the sensitivity to changes in the LGD. Within the CreditEdge™ model, LGD values are calibrated at a sectoral level. The\ncalibration process proceeds by fi rst setting all LGDs to 55% to calculate an overall market price of risk. Once this is set, sectoral LGD\nvalues are calibrated for senior and subordinated debt. Since the average LGD is always 55%, we do not expect changes in recovery\nrates to have a substantial impact over time at an aggregated level. The LGD for particular sectors can vary over time however, as\nshown in Figure 5. Note that the distribution of the recovery rates between sectors narrows considerably around the fi nancial crisis.\n6 See Nazeran and Dwyer (2015) for more details about the drivers of the EDF model.\n7 Average standard deviation of leverage across individual US issuers is 20% of the mean, while the average leverage has a standard deviation of 9% of the mean.\nFor volatility the equivalent fi gures are 13% and 11%.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 79Figure 5 Sectoral senior LGD over time\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 80Backtesting the Model\nThe analysis in the previous two sections suggests that our model should produce illiquidity premia that have a strong, but not\nperfect, correlation with overall market spreads. We also expect that the credit risk component of shorter dated bonds will be more\ndynamic than for bonds of a longer duration. A static analysis of univariate sensitivities and a view of historic correlations between\nthese factors can tell us only so much, however. To get a clearer picture of the overall stability of the model and the dynamics of the\ndecomposition between credit and liquidity risk, we now turn to a full backtest of the model.\nFirst, we consider the behavior of the model under recent market conditions, absent of any particular market-wide credit event.\nFigure 6 shows the evolution over the last four years (16 quarters) of the spread decomposition for an AUD (left) and CAD (right)\ndenominated portfolio of investment-grade corporate bonds. In both cases, movements in spread are explained primarily by changes\nin illiquidity premium. For the CAD portfolio in particular, the credit component of the spread is almost constant over time. For the\nAUD portfolio, there is a higher correlation between the credit and total spreads.\nFigure 6 Components of average (median) spread across an investment-grade portfolio for AUD (left) and CAD (right)\nOur analysis of the dynamics of average 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year EDFs revealed that the 1-year EDF exhibited more point-in-time\nbehavior, with a clear correlation to average spreads, while 5-year and 10-year EDFs are more through-the-cycle. We therefore expect\nthat more of the variation in spreads over time will be explained by changes in credit risk for shorter dated bonds, while for longer\ndated bonds spread changes will be associated with changes in illiquidity premium. Figure 7 shows the decomposition of spread over\ntime for a portfolio of AUD denominated bonds. On the left the portfolio has been fi ltered to just take the average over all bonds with\na duration less than three years, while on the right the averages are calculated over bonds with a duration greater than fi ve years. The\naverage durations of the subsamples are around 1.5 years and 10 years, respectively. The long dated sample shows a very stable total\nspread and credit component over time, while the shorter dated sample has more variability in both illiquidity and credit components.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 81Figure 7 Components of average (median) spread across an investment-grade portfolio for short dated (left) and long dated (right)\nAUD bonds\nUnder stable market conditions, the model produces stable estimates of credit risk and slowly varying illiquidity premia. Under\nstressed market conditions, the behavior could be signifi cantly different, and the credit risk premium should be signifi cantly larger. In\nFigure 8 we compare the decomposition of spreads for fi ve economies at two dates: the end of September 2011 (at the height of the\nEuro sovereign debt crisis) and the end of December 2018. Overall spreads are noticeably higher in 2011 than in 2018 across all\neconomies. Both credit and illiquidity components are higher in 2011. Looking specifi cally at EUR, we have:\nExpected loss was approximately double during the crisis, compared to current conditions.\nComparing 2011 vs. 2018 and working out the increase in the illiquidity premium as a percentage of the increase in spreads, GBP\nshows 64% and EUR shows 68%. To reconcile these sensititivies with the results in Table 1, note that in the earlier section we\nconsidered only univariate stresses, while in this real example the probability of default, the average leverage, and assert volatility\nwill all have changed, which offsets some of the change due to the increase in spreads. In addition, there may BNE distributional,\nconvexity type effects, as the univariate stresses assumed all spreads moved uniformly, while in the real data the shape of the\ndistribution will also have altered.\nFigure 8 Spread decomposition for selected economies at the end of September 2011 and the end of December 2018\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 82The ratio of average illiquidity premium to average total spread is shown for each economy in Table 4. The ratio is higher in 2011 for\nAUD, EUR, and GBP, but lower for CAD and USD. On average, the ratio of credit to illiquidity risk is approximately constant between\nbenign and stressed periods. In two of the fi ve economies the liquidity was a larger component in 2018 while in three it was smaller\nthan in 2011. In addition, the median ratio of illiquidity premia to spread was 57% in 2011 and 54% in 2018.\nTable 4 Average illiquidity premia to spread ratio for selected economies between the end of September 2011 and the end of\nDecember 2018\nAUD CAD EUR GBP USD\n2011 50% 64% 57% 59% 51%\n2018 39% 68% 43% 54% 57%\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 83Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have attempted to examine the sensitivity and stability of our credit spread decomposition. We have also tried\nto verify that it can form an appropriate and usable method to defi ne illiquidity premia for the purpose of setting discount curves\nunder IFRS 17. The analysis shows that over short time periods, the majority of movement in spreads will be attributable to changes\nin liquidity. This is particularly true for long duration bonds, but even for short duration bonds there is a signifi cant sensitivity\nof illiquidity premia to spread changes. Over longer time periods or under more signifi cant market-wide movements, the credit\ncomponent will vary such that rather than keeping a constant absolute credit adjustment, there is a consistent ratio of credit\nadjustment to overall spread.\nCompared to a simple proxy that defi nes the illiquidity premium as a constant fraction of the market spread, our method explains\nmore short term variation in spreads due to changes in liquidity. It also offers a more sophisticated breakdown between portfolios\nof different durations. This is important as different types of business, whether general insurance or life, for example, will likely be\nbacked by different asset portfolios with different average credit quality and duration. In line with the requirement under IFRS 17 that\nthe illiquidity premium should refl ect the characteristics of the liabilities under valuation, our method offers a way to take account of\nthese differences.\nMany insurers will want to align their approach to IFRS 17 with existing regulatory or economic capital calculations. In Europe this is\nlikely to mean starting with the Solvency II regulations and internalizing and adapting the calculations as required. For some parts of\nthe calculation, aligning methodology between Solvency II and IFRS 17 may be straightforward—for example, the choice of risk-free\nrate or the interpolation and extrapolation method and ultimate forward rate. For other parts, such as the credit-risk adjustment,\nalignment may be more diffi cult. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) specifi cally adjusts for\nprobability of default and cost of downgrade, but applies a minimum of 35% of the long-term average spread. EIOPA then scales the\ncredit-adjusted spread by a factor of 65% to derive the fi nal volatility adjustment. An insurer that wants to internalize this method\nwould need to justify the use of the 35% fl oor and 65% application ratio, and the specifi c choice of those numbers. Furthermore, the\nEIOPA volatility adjustment provides only a single reference point and a fl at term structure that does not account for the differing\ncredit decomposition dynamics across duration and over time.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 84Further Reading\nConn, Gavin and Steven Morrison, “Profi t Emergence Under IFRS 9 and IFRS 17: The impact of choice of liability discount rate,”\nMoody’s Analytics White Paper, 2019\nMorrison, Steven, “Implementing IFRS 17 Discount Curves: Theoretical and Practical Challenges,” Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2019\nNazeran, Pooya and Douglas Dwyer, “Credit Risk Modeling of Public Firms: EDF9,” Moody’s Analytics White Paper, 2015\nThompson, Alasdair and Nick Jessop, “A Cost of Capital Approach to Estimating Credit Risk Premia,” Moody’s Analytics White Paper,\n2018\nThompson, Alasdair and Nick Jessop, “Illiquidity and Credit Premia for IFRS 17 at End December 2018,” Moody’s Analytics White\nPaper, 2019.\nBP59250\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IFRS 17 CREDIT AND ILLIQUIDITY PREMIA SENSITIVITY AND BACKTESTING 85IFRS 17 Series Implementing IFRS 17 Discount Curves:\nTheoretical and Practical Challenges\nAuthor\nSteven Morrison\nIntroduction\nSenior Director-Research\nIFRS 17 requires liability cash fl ows to be discounted at rates that refl ect the characteristics of\nContact Us the cash fl ows including their liquidity.

However, a standard approach\nadopted in other contexts (such as calculation of Best Estimate Liabilities under Solvency II) is\nto use stochastic modeling techniques with scenarios generated using a risk-neutral Economic\nScenario Generator (ESG).\nDiscount rates are used in two separate parts of this calculation:\n» To discount liability cash fl ows.\n» To calculate returns on underlying items. In a risk-neutral ESG, the expected returns on all\nassets are equal to the assumed “risk-free” interest-rate.\nNow, it seems consistent with the principles of the standard that (stochastic) liability cash\nfl ows are discounted using a rate that refl ects the liquidity characteristics of those cash fl ows.\nWhat is less clear is whether expected returns on the underlying items should be equal (on\naverage) to the liability discount rate, or some other rate?\n1 Profi t Emergence Under IFRS 9 and IFRS 17: The impact of choice of liability discount rate, Gavin Conn & Steven Morrison\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2019/profi t-emergence-under-ifrs9-ifrs17-the-impact-of-choice-of-\nliabillity-discount-rate.pdf\n2 A cost of capital approach to estimating credit risk premia, Alasdair Thompson & Nick Jessop\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2018/a-cost-of-capital-approach-to-estimating-credit-risk-premium.pdf\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTING IFRS 17 DISCOUNT CURVES: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES 86The Single Yield Curve approach\nThere is a precedent for this question. The Solvency II Volatility Adjustment (VA) is an adjustment to risk-free interest rates that can be\ninterpreted as allowing for the illiquidity of liabilities in the calculation of the Best Estimate Liabilities (BEL). In our experience, insurers\nusing stochastic modeling techniques to calculate the Solvency II BEL have typically incorporated the VA both in the rate used to\ndiscount liability cash fl ows and in the rate used to calculate average returns on assets.3 We call this approach the Single Yield Curve\napproach since a single yield curve is used both for calculating returns on assets and for discounting.\nTo illustrate, suppose that we have a contract where the policyholder receives the value of an underlying fund in 10 years’ time,\nsubject to a minimum guarantee equal to the initial market value of the assets in the fund. We assume no charges for simplicity.\nFigure 1 shows how the value of this liability, as a proportion of the initial market value of the underlying fund, varies depending on\nthe assumed illiquidity premium on the liabilities.4 The value is broken down into two components: (1) the value of the policyholders’\nclaim on the underlying fund; (2) the value of any guarantee shortfalls (the Cost of Guarantees).\nFigure 1: Example liability valuations under the Single Yield Curve approach\nWe note that the Cost of Guarantees decreases with increasing illiquidity premium, partly because the cash fl ows are being\ndiscounted at a higher rate, but also because the average return on the fund is assumed to increase with the illiquidity premium and\nso the guarantee is less likely to bite. We also see that the main component of the liability, the value of the policyholders’ claim to the\nunderlying fund, is always equal to 100% of the initial market value of the assets in the fund and does not depend on the illiquidity\npremium. The rate used to discount is exactly equal to the average return on the underlying fund and so cancels out in the valuation.\n3 Such an approach is proposed in Practical application of Liquidity Premium to the valuation of insurance liabilities and determination of capital requirements, CRO Forum\n(2011), which suggests “a proportion of the liquidity premium should be added to the swap curve for both the accumulation and discount rate.”\n4 Valuations assume a Black-Scholes model with a “risk-free” rate of 2% (+ illiquidity premium) and fund implied volatility of 10%.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTING IFRS 17 DISCOUNT CURVES: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES 87From an implementation point of view, the single yield curve approach simply involves replacing the risk-free yield curve in the\nESG with the liability discount curve. We note, however, two potential issues with the approach, the fi rst practical and the second\ntheoretical:\n» When you change the risk-free yield curve in an ESG, it typically has a knock-on effect on asset prices that are calculated in the ESG.\nRisk-free bond prices obviously change, as do corporate bond prices, and option prices.\nSome insurers have tried to adjust for such impacts by recalibrating other parameters in the ESG to compensate for these changes.\nIn particular, if the liability discount curve incorporates an illiquidity premium (and so risk-free rates are higher than those implied\nfrom risk-free assets in the market), the insurer can recalibrate the ESG credit spread model to ensure that the model still recovers\nmarket corporate bond yields. This is achieved by assuming that model credit spreads are lower than market spreads to offset the\nassumed illiquidity premium. However, this approach has its limits: where corporate bond prices are trading at a spread that is\nlower than the assumed illiquidity premium,5 these prices cannot be matched by the model unless it permits negative spreads.\nMore importantly, such changes to risk-free rates and credit spreads could (depending on the choice of ESG models) result in\nchanges to volatility of asset returns, which in turn result in changes to prices of options on those assets. Though such changes\ncould be allowed for in recalibration of other model parameters, this creates an additional calibration effort which could be\nsignifi cant.\nThe calibration issues can be avoided by applying the illiquidity premium as an adjustment to ESG outputs, such as asset returns\nand discount factors, rather than adjusting the ESG’s input risk-free yield curve (and other calibration parameters). However,\napplication of such adjustments is likely to require implementation effort within the ESG and/or cash fl ow model.\n» If you assume an illiquidity premium on liability discount rates, it seems natural to expect a corresponding illiquidity discount in\nliability valuations. Using the Single Yield Curve approach, we observe this behavior in the valuation of the Cost of Guarantees.\nHowever, we do not see it in the valuation of the policyholders’ claim to the underlying fund, which is always equal to the market\nvalue of the underlying fund regardless of the assumed illiquidity premium. If we expect to see that the illiquidity premium is\nrefl ected in the valuation of the policyholders’ claim to the underlying fund, we need a different approach.\nThe Dual Yield Curve approach\nAn alternative approach is to use two different rates:\n1. Rate used to discount liability cash fl ows = risk-free rate + liability illiquidity premium.\n2. Expected return on underlying items = risk-free rate + asset illiquidity premium.6\nWe call this approach the Dual Yield Curve approach.\nFigure 2 shows how the value of the example contract varies with the liability illiquidity premium under the Dual Yield Curve\napproach. Here we assume an asset illiquidity premium of 20 bps, and the liability illiquidity premium is expressed in terms of its\ndifference relative to the assumed asset illiquidity premium.\n5 For example, this could be the case for bonds with a higher credit quality than the average rating of the bonds in the reference portfolio used to derive the illiquidity\npremium.\n6 Strictly speaking, expected returns on each individual asset class are adjusted for their specifi c illiquidity premia.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTING IFRS 17 DISCOUNT CURVES: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES 88Figure 2: Example liability valuations under the Dual Yield Curve approach\nAs with the Single Yield Curve approach, the Cost of Guarantees decreases with increasing illiquidity premium because the cash fl ows\nare being discounted at a higher rate. However, the effect is less than in the Single Yield Curve approach (as under the Single Yield\nCurve approach there is an additional effect due to the liability illiquidity premium impacting on the expected return on assets).\nMore signifi cantly, the value of the policyholders’ claim to the underlying fund is only equal to the market value of the underlying\nfund in the case where liability and asset illiquidity premia are the same. If the liability illiquidity premium is greater than that on the\nunderlying assets, the policyholders’ claim to the underlying fund is valued at a discount to the market value of the fund, refl ecting\nthat the policyholder has given up some liquidity by accessing the fund through an insurance “wrapper” (rather than buying the fund\nassets directly). On the other hand, if the liability illiquidity premium is less than that on the underlying assets, the policyholders’\nclaim to the underlying fund is valued at a premium to the market value of the underlying assets, refl ecting that the insurance\nwrapper provides additional liquidity in this case (relative to buying the fund assets directly).7\nIn terms of practical implementation within an ESG, both the Single Yield Curve and Dual Yield Curve approaches assume that the\nexpected return on assets includes an illiquidity premium relative to the risk-free rate, with the liability illiquidity premium being\nused in the former case and the asset illiquidity premium being used in the latter. As noted in the discussion of the Single Yield Curve\napproach in the previous section, the implementation of an illiquidity premium as an adjustment to the risk-free curve can create\nissues related to calibration of other ESG assumptions, in the event that the liability illiquidity premium exceeds the market spread on\nassets. The Dual Curve approach should avoid this problem, as the assumed asset illiquidity premium should never exceed the asset’s\nmarket spread. Alternatively, the asset illiquidity premium can be implemented as an adjustment to ESG output asset returns, rather\nthan adjusting the ESG’s input risk-free yield curve. Either way, the liability illiquidity premium would be applied as an adjustment to\noutput discount factors.\n7 Similar differences are observed in closed-end funds, which often trade at a discount or premium to the underlying Net Asset Value. This “puzzle” is sometimes (at least\npartly) attributed to relative liquidity differences between the underlying assets and the closed-end fund.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTING IFRS 17 DISCOUNT CURVES: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES 89What is the ‘right’ approach?\nAs far as we are aware, there is no standard accepted theory of valuation incorporating illiquidity. In particular, the classic option\npricing literature is based on a dynamic replication argument that makes no allowance for the illiquidity characteristics of the cash\nfl ows being replicated, nor those of the replicating portfolio. So what is the “right” approach?\nUnfortunately, the standard itself does not provide a defi nitive answer. As IFRS 17 does not prescribe the methodology and\nassumptions to be used in valuing liabilities, insurers need to use judgment as to the appropriate approach given their views on\nilliquidity, and be able to justify such assumptions to auditors. In particular, the incorporation of illiquidity premia into existing\nstochastic modeling approaches could result in changes to the interpretation of standard accepted tests of appropriateness (in\nparticular “martingale” or “1=1” tests), requiring careful communication with auditors.\nBP57816\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTING IFRS 17 DISCOUNT CURVES: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES 90© 2019 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
