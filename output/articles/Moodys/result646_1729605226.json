For entities\nwith both publicly traded equity and liquid CDS transactions, CDS-I-EDF measures provide an alternative assessment of default risk\nthat can be directly compared with default probabilities (PDs) calculated by the Public Firm EDF model. For entities without publicly\ntraded equity, CDS-I-EDF measures expand the default probability coverage of CreditEdge, Moody’s Analytics’ suite of industry leading\ncredit metrics that incorporate signals from equity and credit markets. CDS-I-EDF measures are available on a daily basis, for 1,500\nentities, including public and private firms, subsidiaries of public and private firms, sovereigns, state-owned and supranational entities,\nand municipalities. Fair Value CDS (FVS-CDS) spreads are modeled CDS spreads derived from EDF measures that can be directly\ncompared with observed CDS spreads. FVS-CDS can be used for mark-to-market valuation and portfolio management and are\npublished daily for 29,000 entities with EDF measures. The modeling framework for calculating CDS-I-EDF measures from CDS spreads\nworks in reverse to calculate FVS-CDS from EDF measures.\nCDS-I-EDF measures and FVS-CDS are a part of the CreditEdgeTM suite of credit metrics and available through multiple channels:\n» A web-based platform\n» An Excel add-in\n» A data file service (DFS)\n» An Application Programming Interface (API)\nWhat Differentiates the CDS-I-EDF Model?\nFinancial institutions, corporations, asset managers, insurance firms, and regulators include CDS-I-EDF measures and FVS-CDS in\ntheir credit risk management toolkits for the following reasons:\n» Global coverage\n» Forward-looking, point-in-time default probabilities\n» Uniquely dynamic and granular estimation of sovereign credit risk\n» Relative value trading applications\n» Accurate, consistent, and transparent methodology for assessing rated and unrated public exposures\n» Comprehensive documentation, regular model validation, and modeling enhancements based on extensive research\n© COPYRIGHT 2016, MOODY’S ANALYTICS, INC., AND/OR ITS LICENSORS AND AFFILIATES (TOGETHER, \"MOODY'S).

While risk-neutral default probabilities adjust for investors’ risk aversion, physical default probabilities, which can be\nthought of as “real world” default probabilities, do not. CDS spreads reflect expected loss – equal to the product of probability of\ndefault (PD) and loss given default (LGD) – and the risk premium, but oftentimes PDs extracted from CDS spreads fail to remove\nthe risk premium. These risk-neutral PDs overstate actual default rates, especially among higher rated entities.1 CDS-I-EDF\nmeasures are physical PDs; since they filter out the premium investors demand to compensate them for risk inherent in the CDS\ncontract, they reflect only the risk of the underlying credit.\nHow Is the CDS-I-EDF Model Validated?\nThe CDS-I-EDF model is validated, separately, by region and rating class on several dimensions:\n» Level accuracy: Is the geometric average of CDS-I-EDF measures consistent with the geometric average of EDF measures\nover time? Is the geometric average of FVS-CDS consistent with the geometric average of CDS spreads over time?\n» Cross-sectional correlations: How correlated are FVS-CDS and CDS spreads over time?\n» Sensitivity of credit returns to equity returns: How do CDS-I-EDF hedge ratios compare to empirical hedge ratios? In other\nwords, is the sensitivity of debt to equity implied by CDS-I-EDF measures consistent with what is observed in actual bond and\nequity data?\n» Convergence in differences between FVS-CDS and CDS spreads: Over time, do the differences between FVS-CDS and CDS\nspreads persist or converge? If they converge, they could have an application for asset managers in exploiting market\nmispricing.\nOur validation exercises show the CDS-I-EDF model to produce CDS-I-EDF measures on the same average level as EDF measures\nand FVS-CDS on the same average level as CDS spreads, with reasonably high cross-sectional correlation. The model predicts\nhedge ratios consistent with empirical values, thus allowing assessment of changes in credit portfolio values using equity value\nchanges, a useful application for illiquid credit exposures. The model also identifies differences in opinion between CDS and equity\nmarkets. The convergence of opinions over time presents an opportunity for asset managers to explore profitable trading\nopportunities.\nHow Does the CDS-I-EDF Model Work?2\nA CDS contract is in effect an insurance policy for default risk, whereby the buyer pays the seller a premium in exchange for a\nguaranteed payment in the event that the debtor defaults or experiences a specified credit event. The premium, or the CDS\nspread, therefore, reflects expected loss, after accounting for investors’ risk aversion. The modeling framework for CDS-I-EDF\ntranslates between CDS spreads and risk-neutral PDs via a spread valuation equation built upon the observation that the cost of a\nCDS contract to the buyer must equal its benefit and an assumption about the risk-neutral PD term structure. The translation\nbetween risk-neutral PDs and physical PDs relies upon a structural definition of default in which a firm defaults when the market\nvalue of its assets falls below the value of its debt obligations and an assumption that the trade-off between risk and return follows\nthe Capital Asset Pricing Model. The sequence of translations can run in either direction, yielding CDS-I-EDF measures from CDS\nspreads or FVS-CDS from EDF measures.\n1 J. Hull et al. “Bond Prices, Default Probabilities, and Risk Premiums”. Journal of Credit Risk. Spring 2005.\n2 This document provides a basic overview of the CDS-I-EDF model. For those seeking a detailed description, please see: “EDF9 Updates for Bond and CDS\nValuation Models”, Moody’s Analytics, August 2015; Nazaran et al, “EDF9 Overview”, Moody’s Analytics Modeling Methodology, Month Year; and Dwyer et\nal, “CDS-Implied EDF Credit Measures and Fair-Value Spreads”, Moody’s Analytics Modeling Methodology, March 2010.\n2 NOVEMBER 2016 CDS-IIMPLIEDEDF MEASURES AND FAIR VALUE CDS SPREADS–AT A GLANCEFigure 1 CDS-I-EDF / FVS-CDS Model Mechanics\nModel Drivers\nIn addition to CDS spreads, there are two key drivers in the CDS-I-EDF model. Region- and sector-specific LGDs and region- and\nrating class-specific market Sharpe ratios are estimated as part of the translation processes using a two-step procedure. We start\nwith an initial assumption of 60% LGD. We then estimate market Sharpe ratios by region (North America, Europe, Japan, Rest of\nWorld) and rating class (investment grade, high-yield) using the spread valuation equation that allows us to translate CDS spreads\nto risk-neutral PDs. This captures the observation that, for example, Japanese companies tend to have lower CDS spreads than US\ncompanies with similar EDF levels, and investment grade companies tend to have lower CDS spreads than high yield companies\nwith similar EDF levels. Finally, we calibrate LGDs by region and sector so that the averages of observed and EDF-implied five-year\nspreads are comparable. This removes lingering systematic bias in CDS-I-EDF measures for certain sectors. Market Sharpe ratios\nand LGDs are calculated and applied daily to produce both CDS-I-EDF measures and FVS-CDS. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the drivers\nfor select samples.\nFigure 2 Market Sharpe Ratios for Investment Grade Firms, Figure 3 Market Sharpe Ratios for High Yield Firms, by\nby Region Region\n3 NOVEMBER 2016 CDS-IIMPLIEDEDF MEASURES AND FAIR VALUE CDS SPREADS–AT A GLANCEFigure 4 LGDs for North American Banks and S&Ls and North American High Tech Firms\nCDS-I-EDF Term Structure\nCDS-I-EDF measures are first calculated for a five-year horizon using five-year CDS spreads. The five-year CDS-I-EDF represents\nthe probability that a firm will default within the next five years. We also produce a term structure of CDS-I-EDF measures for\neach entity from one to four years. A term structure of default probabilities is necessary for pricing, hedging, and risk management\nof long-term obligations.\nLike the Public Firm EDF model term structure, the CDS-I-EDF term structure recognizes and accounts for three components:\n» Long-run, central default tendency: Captures the observation that over the long-run, each firm’s default risk converges to\nsome level, which varies by firm size and industry.\n» Aggregate factor: Captures the systematic component of default risk, which varies with the overall state of the credit cycle.\n» Firm-specific factor: Captures the firm-specific component of default risk, which is a function of a firm’s current EDF\nmeasure relative to its expected EDF measure given its long-run, central default tendency and the aggregate factor.\nThe long-run, central default tendency and aggregate factors are taken directly from the Public Firm EDF model. The firm-specific\nfactor is disaggregated into persistent and transitory effects in the CDS-I-EDF model. These effects are estimated using maximum\nlikelihood.\nCDS-I-EDF Measures for Sovereigns\nCDS-I-EDF measures provide a unique opportunity to assess the credit risk of sovereigns. Sovereigns do not have traded equity,\nbut they often have traded CDS spreads. Market prices reflect factors – such as willingness to pay – that fundamental credit\napproaches may not. The interpretation of sovereign CDS spreads is similar to that of corporates.\nSovereign default is more complicated than for corporates. Sovereigns do not liquidate, and creditors cannot force liquidation.\nWillingness to pay is as important as ability to pay. Most defaults ultimately result in a debt restructuring.\nCDS-I-EDF measures for sovereigns are estimated in exactly the same manner as for corporates. However, we make two\nassumptions. First, we assume LGD is always equal to 75%. Although there have been many sovereign defaults in the past several\ndecades, very few have occurred since the advent of the CDS market, and realized recovery data for the recent past is scarce. Our\nassumption is supported by CDS dealer quotes, which highlight the market practice of assuming 25% recovery. Second, we\nassume the market price of risk is the same as for North American corporate or high yield issuers. This assumption is supported by\nour own research and some academic research.3\n3 For example, see Longstaff et al, “How Sovereign Is Sovereign Credit Risk”, NBER Working Paper No. 13658.\n4 NOVEMBER 2016 CDS-IIMPLIEDEDF MEASURES AND FAIR VALUE CDS SPREADS–AT A GLANCEWhat Are the Inputs and Outputs to the CDS-I-EDF Model ?\nInputs\nThe primary inputs to the CDS-I-EDF model are five-year CDS spreads and five-year EDF measures. Raw CDS spreads are first\nconverted to a common DocClause and then aggregated for each entity across currencies and dealers. EDF measures are\ncalculated in the Public Firm EDF model.4 Extensive data quality checks ensure that pricing data is complete and based on\nsufficiently liquid contracts.\nOutputs\nThe CDS-I-EDF model produces CDS-I-EDF measures for one through five year horizons and FVS-CDS spreads for a five year\nhorizon. The key drivers to the model – market Sharpe ratios and LGDs – are also published.\nFigure 5 Sample CreditEdge CDS Dashboard\nHow Are Customers Using CDS-I-EDF Measures?\nUnderwriting\nLenders use EDF and CDS-I-EDF measures to provide systematic evaluations of obligors at the time of origination. EDF and CDS-I-\nEDF measures and EDF-Implied ratings are also often employed in pre-qualification assessments. Additionally, the metrics are\nemployed in internal scorecards to improve the quantitative analysis of borrowers. Finally, the metrics are used for credit approval\nand credit limit setting based on internal thresholds and risk appetites.\nPricing, Reserves & Limit Setting\nEDF and CDS-I-EDF measures enhance risk-based pricing of loans and vendor contracts. As a key input to expected loss\ncalculations, EDF measures are a key input to many banks’ processes for setting reserves, and they inform the process by which\nbanks set credit limits for different segments of their portfolios.\nCounterparty Assessment\nEDF and CDS-I-EDF measures helps users assess the credit risk of their suppliers and service providers based on default\nprobabilities and implied ratings. The CreditEdge platform provides continuous monitoring of counterparties, so that users can\nquickly identify potential changes in vendor creditworthiness. This allows them to get ahead of possible credit deterioration, and\nthus manage their business continuity risk.\nEarly Warning & Portfolio Monitoring\nMoody’s Analytics has developed an EDF early warning toolkit, a set of metrics we recommend users employ to effectively and\nefficiently monitor their portfolios.5 An accompanying Excel template that leverage the CreditEdge Excel Add-In provides a turnkey\nsolution for putting the toolkit into practice. The CreditEdge website has a number of features (e.g., alerts) that allow users to\nmonitor changes in obligor credit quality and apply the toolkit’s approach for identifying at-risk names. As forward-looking\nprobability of default metrics, EDF measures have helped risk managers allocate resources more effectively. Prior research has\n4 For more details, please see “Public Firm Expected Default (EDF) Measures – At a Glance”, Moody’s Analytics.\n5 See Ferry, Baron, and Hamilton, “Using EDF Measures to Identify At-Risk Names – A Monitoring & Early Warning Toolkit”, Moody’s Analytics Viewpoints,\nApril 2016.\n5 NOVEMBER 2016 CDS-IIMPLIEDEDF MEASURES AND FAIR VALUE CDS SPREADS–AT A GLANCEshown that taking the worst of EDF and CDS-I-EDF measures yields a more accurate credit measure than taking either of the two\nindividually.6\nPre-Screen Investments & Perform Relative Value Analysis\nAsset managers, particularly investors in corporate bonds, use EDF and CDS-I-EDF measures in a number of ways. They are\nemployed to increase the efficiency of portfolio surveillance; to find undervalued assets; and as inputs into a variety of quantitative\nsecurity and portfolio construction and valuation models. Our research shows that EDF measures can be used to construct\nportfolios of bonds that minimize default risk while maintaining a target yield. Such strategies result in superior risk-adjusted (i.e.,\nhigher Sharpe ratios) as well.\nInputs to Internal Risk Rating Systems\nInternal rating systems are the foundation of many business decisions within financial institutions. They typically combine\nquantitative and qualitative factors at both the market/industry-level and firm-level. Since EDF and CDS-I-EDF measures are based\non large amounts of data and rigorous statistical methods, they are often used as quantitative inputs to internal risk rating\nsystems.\nBenchmarking & Calibrating Internal Risk Rating Systems\nEDF and CDS-I-EDF measures reflect the experience learned from the large number of defaults in our database, as well as other\ncredit-related inputs. They are therefore well-suited for benchmarking and calibrating internal risk systems. Many institutions do\nnot possess enough internal data for this purpose, so using external data sources such as EDF and CDS-I-EDF measures improves\nmodel accuracy.\nInput to Bank Regulatory Capital Calculations\nProbabilities of default associated with internal ratings play a central role in the calculation of capital requirements in the Basel\nframework. Many banks use EDF, CDS-I-EDF, or Through-the-Cycle (TTC) EDF measures as part of their internal ratings, either for\nregulatory capital calculations or for benchmarking and calibrating their internal models to fulfill regulatory requirements.\nInput to Required Economic Capital Calculation\nEDF and CDS-I-EDF measures provides the probability of default input needed in portfolio models to calculate expected loss (EL),\nunexpected loss (UL), and thus subsequently to set economic capital (EC). Many institutions leverage EDF measures in this\ncapacity.\nLoss Provisioning\nEDF and CDS-I-EDF measures are used to estimate the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their loans, information vital to\ndetermine appropriate levels of loan loss provisions. Borrowers can use firms’ EDF term structures to establish loss provisions for\nlong-dated exposures.\nFor More Information\nTo learn more about the CDS-I-EDF model and its applications, please contact our experts at clientservices@moodys.com.\n6 Dwyer et al, “CDS-Implied EDF Credit Measures and Fair-Value Spreads”, Moody’s Analytics Modeling Methodology, March 2010.\n6 NOVEMBER 2016 CDS-IIMPLIEDEDF MEASURES AND FAIR VALUE CDS SPREADS–AT A GLANCE"
