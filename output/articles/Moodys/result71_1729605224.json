Host countries have opened new reception centres and have drawn\non existing centres for asylum seekers, hotels, hostels, schools, tents, and even cruise ships. The transition from\nthese temporary solutions to longer-term solutions remains a struggle, with heavy pressure on rental markets.\nAnd the inflow of refugees has not drawn to a close. More than 1 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine\nhave indicated a desire to relocate abroad, while Russian attacks on infrastructure continue to disrupt access to\nheat, electricity and water, driving more civilians from their homes.\nProviding the support needed to accommodate the massive influx of refugees bears a financial cost. Costs\nincurred by the EU in 2022 are estimated to exceed €25 billion. At the onset of the invasion, the EU identified\naround €17 billion of funds to meet urgent needs such as housing and healthcare. Only a fraction of these fundsMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nhas been dispersed to member states, meaning that individual countries have been footing the bills upfront. Private individuals have also swallowed a\nsignificant share of the costs while struggling to meet high prices for energy and food.\nSuccessful integration into society and the labour market is critical to minimizing the fiscal costs of support measures and allowing refugees to rebuild\ntheir lives. Refugees face enormous challenges entering foreign labour markets: language barriers, skill mismatches, unrecognized qualifications, not to\nmention the stresses of leaving a war zone and childcare responsibilities—around one-third of Ukrainian refugees are children. Available evidence suggests\nthat nearly 70% of Ukrainian refugees of working age in the EU had entered the labour force by September. Not all of them had found their way into\nemployment at that stage, but in the countries neighbouring Ukraine, which include Poland and Slovakia, about 40% of working-age individuals were in\nsome form of employment or self-employment.\nIntegrating Refugees Into Labour Markets Is Crucial\nLabourmarket status of Ukraine refugees in EU, % survey respondents, Sep 2022\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nEmployed/self-employed Unemployed Inactive Retired\nNeighbouring countries Other Europe\nSources: UNHCR, Eurostat, Moody’s Analytics\nChallenge: European energy security\nThe Russian war in Ukraine threw Europe’s dependency on Russian gas into sharp focus. The EU, which has traditionally relied on Russia for approximately\n40% of its gas consumption, faced an abrupt dislocation in supply in 2022 as Russia turned off the taps. Europe realized too late the inadvisability of being\nlocked into a single supplier. Firms faced the possibility of gas rationing, while households faced the prospect of being unable to heat their homes during\nthe winter.\nExtreme Volatility in European Gas Price\nDutch natural gas TTF, € per MWh, 1-mo forward contract\n350\nNord Stream 1 stops\n300\nRussia\ninvades\n250 Yamal pipeline Ukraine\nbriefly stops\n200 supplying gas Cold weather\nacross Europe\n150\n100\n50\n0\n5-May-21 29-Sep-21 23-Feb-22 20-Jul-22 14-Dec-22\nSources: Bloomberg, Spectron Group, Moody’s AnalyticsMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nThe gas price started to rise in 2021 as flows from Russia declined, notably in the last quarter of the year. After an initial period of turbulence in the wake\nof the invasion in 2022, the price started to rise again over the summer, reaching its apex with the closure of Nord Stream 1, a major pipeline used to bring\nRussian gas into Germany, which ceased operation on 11 July. Initially shut down by Russia for routine maintenance, it quickly became apparent that flows\nwere unlikely to resume and that Russia had resorted to weaponising gas in retaliation against EU sanctions. The European gas price peaked at nearly €350\nper megawatt-hour, and fears mounted that Europe would run out of gas during the winter.\nEurope scrambled to reorient itself, urgently seeking out and securing liquefied natural gas on the international market. The U.S. proved an able supplier,\nwhile Europe benefited from muted economic activity in East Asia, causing total supplies to Europe in 2022 to be similar to volumes received in 2021.\nAlong with energy conservation measures implemented by EU member states over the year, high gas prices led to demand destruction causing demand to\nfall by 10% to 30% depending on the country and sector. A period of warm weather at the onset of winter also helped, and a year after the invasion,\nEuropean gas markets have almost completely pivoted away from Russian gas.\nEurope’s Pivot to LNG\n2022 EU gas imports: bil cubic meters\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nRussia Pipeline LNG Other Total\n2021 2022\nSources: Breugel, Moody’s Analytics\nSeveral additional developments will be positive: Europe has ample gas in storage—a situation that is expected to continue—suggesting that the summer\nreplenishment requirement will not be as extreme as in 2022; it will become easier for Europe to receive and process additional supplies of LNG as new\nregasification terminals come onstream during the first half of the year; new contracts with the UAE and Qatar will allow for additional supply sources\nover the next few years.\nBalanced against these positives is the pressure on international markets that might arise from the economic reopening of China, especially in the latter\nhalf of 2023. Increased demand for LNG from East Asia could bid up gas prices. Although prices will be elevated for some time when compared with the\npre-pandemic average of close to €10 per MWh, it does seem unlikely that the extreme movements in prices seen last year will be repeated this year.\nOil has been less of a concern. While oil prices spiked in the weeks after the invasion, sanctions on Russian oil have been introduced in a measured way.\nThe U.S., the U.K., and a few other countries were the first to ban imports of Russian crude and distillates, but it took nine months for the much more\nconsequential EU ban to come into place. The EU imported approximately 25% of its oil requirements from Russia and introduced an oil embargo in two\nphases. The first in December covered crude imports, while the second in February extended the ban to oil products. These bans mean that Russian oil,\nbarring some carve-outs, will not flow into Europe, but the world has not lost Russian supply. Other countries such as India, China, and various emerging\nmarkets have taken advantage of the significantly discounted price of Russian oil to make opportunistic purchases. As long as such rerouting continues,\nthe oil market will continue to be supplied by Russian oil. Not surprisingly, markets have responded with equanimity to the various embargoes.\nChallenge: An international food crisis\nCompounding the surge in gas and oil prices, agricultural commodity prices also soared in the aftermath of Ukraine’s invasion. This is because Russia and\nUkraine are among the world’s top exporters of agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, barley, sunflower seeds, etc. Together their global trade\naccounts for as much as 50% of sunflower oil and one-quarter of wheat. Crucially, more than half of wheat imports in numerous African countries,\ndeveloping Europe, and the Middle East come from Russia and Ukraine.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nExports from Russia and Ukraine\n% of world trade (pre-invasion)\nRussia World ranking Ukraine World ranking Sum\nSunflower seed oil 16.1% 2 56.0% 1 72.1%\nWheat 18.4% 1 7.0% 5 25.4%\nRapeseed 2.0% 9 15.1% 2 17.1%\nCorn 1.7% 9 13.1% 4 14.8%\nFertilizers 13.3% 1 0.3% - 13.6%\nRapeseed oil 7.6% 3 2.1% 10 9.7%\nSoybeans 0.5% 7 1.9% 6 2.4%\nSources: Observatory of Economic Complexity, Moody’s Analytics\nAgricultural exports from Ukraine all but stopped between February and July as Ukraine’s Black Sea ports were blockaded, and exports from Russia fell\nsharply despite Western sanctions having special carve-outs for the food and fertilizer sectors. This was because Western logistic, export and insurance\ncompanies decided to pull out from the Russian market, while restrictions on using EU territory for transit purposes complicated matters further. Fears of\na global food crunch caused export bans to be imposed by other major players such as India and Kazakhstan, which further fuelled the crisis. On the\nupside, the establishment of solidarity lanes by the EU—alternative road, rail and fluvial transport routes—combined with the reopening of Ukraine’s Black\nSea Ports in August allowed for wholesale food prices to ease somewhat, especially those for wheat and maize. But given that exports from Ukraine in the\n2022-2023 season still were more than 30% below the previous year’s and further below pre-pandemic levels, agricultural prices remain relatively\nelevated compared with past standards.\nAgricultural Prices Remain Elevated\nFuture prices, 3 Jan=100\n170\n160\n150\n140\n130\n120\n110\n100\n90\n80\n70\n2-Mar-21 29-May-21 25-Aug-21 21-Nov-21 17-Feb-22 16-May-22 12-Aug-22 8-Nov-22 4-Feb-23\nCorn Soybeans Wheat\nSources: Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Moody’s Analytics\nHigh fertilizer prices have compounded the problem. Fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive, as gas is used as feedstock and fuel in the fertilizer\nindustry. Indeed, the sharp increase in natural gas prices in Europe has led to widespread production cutbacks in ammonia—an important input for\nnitrogen fertilizers. As of October, about 70% of European ammonia production capacity had been reduced or shut down.\nAdditionally, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are a crucial mining and production region for two of the three types of fertilizers applied to ensure crop\ngrowth—potash and nitrogen. Here too, international firms pulled out despite carve-outs, while Russia announced export restrictions, leading to a collapse\nin the supply chain and a sharp decline in Russian fertilizer exports to the rest of the world. This sharp reduction in fertilizer supply and high gas prices led\nto a surge in global fertilizer prices. Fertilizers are among farmers’ largest expenses. Given that some growing seasons last for as long as eight months, it\nwill likely be a while before this surge in farmers’ input prices drops out of wholesale agricultural prices. On the upside, fertilizer prices have decreased\nsignificantly over the past months owing to normalising gas prices.\nIn addition to elevated grain and fertilizer prices, retail food prices are being pressured by still-elevated energy costs, not to mention high labour costs.\nFood production is energy intensive, as processing and packaging require energy for heating, cooling and electricity. To that, we add fuel costs for\ntransportation and electricity costs for retailers. While gas, electricity and fuel prices have come down in recent months, they remain elevated compared\nwith their pre-invasion, pre-pandemic averages, which suggests that retail food prices will stay heightened for some time. Low-income populations are\ntaking the largest blow, as a larger part of their inflation basket comprises food products and energy usage. The situation is especially dire in poorer\ncountries in Africa and Asia, where governments don’t have the resources to step up and subsidize a part of the higher food and electricity bills—as most\nEuropean countries have done.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nChallenge: A new geopolitical era\nRussia, subject to heavy sanctions and ostracized by Europe, North America and their allies, is out in the cold, but as the war enters its second year, the\nworld is also trying to adjust to a new geopolitical reality.\nNATO’s enlargement into Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union had long been a point of contention for Russia. Ukraine’s ambition to apply\nfor NATO membership in recent years ostensibly motivated the Russian invasion, but if Russia hoped that this would halt NATO’s enlargement, then it has\nfailed. Finland and Sweden applied for membership last year, while Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia have informed NATO of their wish to join. Ukraine has\nalso formally applied for membership. Over the past year, NATO has worked to avoid triggering Article 5 of its constitution, which would drag it openly into\nwar with Russia, and it is unlikely, therefore, to ratify Ukraine’s application soon. The resurgence of interest in NATO shows the absence of a viable alternative,\nand though NATO involvement in the war remains a tail scenario, the bloc will have to tread carefully.\nA war on European soil has raised questions around decades-long European ambivalence towards a common defence policy. The EU responded in 2022\nwith several initiatives but despite these efforts, European defence policy is largely driven by the capabilities and attitudes of individual member states.\nRecent discussions in Germany about the supply of tanks to Ukraine highlighted the growing unease around increased involvement in the war. Extreme\nleft and extreme right parties in the country have taken divisive positions, with the former seeking to stop the supply of weapons. Absorbed by economic\nproblems at home, at least some Europeans are reluctant to continue to pour budgetary resources into the war. Europe may backslide on its commitment\nto stop war on the Continent, and divisive politics may weaken its leadership.\nA new international geopolitical order is also emerging, one that pits the U.S. against China and in which other states have to find their role. The growing\nregionalisation, largely based on the U.S.’s perception of the strategic threat posed by China, has implications for the war in Ukraine. Until recently, China\nhas largely been publicly silent on the war while supplying Russia with weapons. Its recent 12-point peace proposal suggests that it is reconsidering its role\non the international stage. Given the level of distrust between the two superpowers, it feels unlikely that they will find common cause in bringing an end\nto the war. Europe, caught in the middle between the two, may find it difficult to choose sides.\nChallenge: Surge in military spending\nThe war in Ukraine has sparked financial commitments across the EU and other Western allies to strengthen their military capacities. Since the mid-1980s,\nmilitary spending had been on a declining trend worldwide. This decline coincided with an expansion of spending on social programmes. Government\nfinances are finite, and political priorities determine how these finite resources are allocated. As the Cold War drew to a close, priorities shifted away from\nbuilding up military defences and towards building social safety nets for households—the so-called peace dividend.\nThe downward trend in military spending reversed abruptly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, putting paid to the idea of a peace dividend. The U.S.,\nCanada, Japan, Australia, and most countries in Europe have been ramping up defence spending. Two-thirds of NATO members have announced firm\nnear-term pledges to boost military spending to at least 2% of GDP.\nMost NATO Members Target 2% of GDP Military Spending by 2024\nMilitary spending, % of GDP\nLuxembourg\nBelgium\nSlovenia\nDenmark\nItaly\nCzechia\nNetherlands\nSpain\nAlbania 2021 Target by 2024\nCanada\nNorth Macedonia\nGermany\nPortugal\nMontenegro\nBulgaria\nTurkey\nHungary\nSlovak Republic\nNorway\nFrance\nCroatia\nUnited Kingdom\nLatvia\nRomania\nEstonia\nLithuania\nPoland\nUnited States\nGreece\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0\nSources: NATO, Kirk-Wade and Balakrishnan (2022), Moody’s Analytics\nThe increase in military spending comes on the tail of massive fiscal supports during the COVID-19 pandemic, cost-of-living support measures in response to\nthe surge in energy prices, rising debt-servicing costs, and dwindling tax revenues as the global economy teeters on the brink of recession. Meanwhile, longer-MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nterm spending pressures from an ageing population and climate commitments continue to build. The pivot towards higher defence spending, if permanent, will\nleave a legacy of higher debt, and divert scarce resources from social programmes, health budgets, education, and other government services.\nOpportunity: European climate transition\nThe hugely negative aspects of war make it difficult to contemplate meaningful opportunities that might arise beyond the opportunistic. However, Europe\nhas been presented with an opportunity that deserves special mention—a faster climate transition.\nTo confront the energy security threat, the EU issued a policy proposal known as the REPowerEU plan back in May that aimed for progress in three areas\nto speed up energy independence. The first was short-term supplier diversification, primarily by increasing LNG and pipeline supplies. The second was\ngreater coordination, monitoring and enforcement of standards for gas in storage across the EU and potentially also a more coordinated approach in gas\nprocurement. The third is to increase the pace of climate mitigation, thereby lessening reliance on fossil fuels and eliminating Russia as a supplier. The first\ntwo parts of the REPowerEU plan aimed for greater security of gas supplies, while the focus of the third is on diversification away from gas and into\nrenewables. This part of the plan builds on the EU’s existing plan for Net Zero transition known as the Fit for 55 package.\nEnhanced Climate Measures to 2030\nEU gas consumption, bilcubic metres\n450\n400\n400\n350\n300\n-116\n250\n-37\n200 -27 191\n-17\n-12\n150\n100\n50\n0\n2020 Fit for 55 Energy efficiency Renewable Biomethane Reduced use 2030\nhydrogen in industry\nSources: European Commission, Moody’s Analytics\nAs the chart shows, the new areas of focus are energy efficiency and an increase in zero emission gases. Use of heat exchange pumps and tighter criteria\naround buildings and residential emissions will result in a 37 billion cubic meter drop in gas consumption. Renewable hydrogen and biomethane will\naccount for a further 44-bcm drop in gas demand, while reduced gas use in industry will further reduce demand by 12 bcm. Successful implementation of\nthese additional climate measures together with the Fit for 55 package could lead to a 190-bcm drop in gas consumption by 2030.\nThe plan has been overtaken by events. The EU planned to shift away from Russian gas over five years, but did not anticipate that Russia would turn off\nthe taps within a few months. Having sourced alternative gas supplies, the danger now is that the EU loses momentum on the third pillar of the\nREPowerEU plan and backslides on its own upgraded climate ambitions. The cumbersome planning process and the time taken to obtain permissions for\nrenewable installations have been subject to a fair bit of criticism. Similarly, the handling of Recovery Funds—the grants and loans given out from the EU\nbudget to member states for climate projects—have been criticized for being too slow and for coming with too many strings attached. EU regulations\nneed to be simplified and the process by which member states obtain fiscal support for climate projects from the EU needs to be more efficient, both of\nwhich require political will. The EU should not lose sight of its accelerated climate goals.\nOpportunity: A stronger Europe\nEurope has been battered by two significant economic storms in the last three years: first by COVID-19 and then, just as the region was hoping for a year\nof recovery, by the war in Ukraine. In both cases, the European Union has had to pull together and rely on regional decision-making and the use of\ncommon funds. The ability of the region to come together as a bloc in times of crisis is its core strength and EU institutions have time and again come to\nthe region’s rescue. In 2022, Europe had to set policy and allocate funds at the regional level to deal with the consequences of the Russian invasion on\nmultiple fronts:\n• The Temporary Protection Scheme gave Ukrainian refugees fast access to assistance and gave them the right to work across the EU.\n• The REPowerEU plan put forward proposals to coordinate gas purchases to take full advantage of the bloc’s purchasing power. The EU also\nestablished a monitoring system for reserve usage across member states and issued recommendations for energy conservation. Towards the end\nof the year, it introduced circuit breakers in the gas market to avoid extreme price movements in the near-term gas futures market.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\n• The EU will reintroduce its fiscal rules this year. These were suspended at the onset of the pandemic and subsequently remained suspended to\ngive member states the leeway to deal with issues arising from the war in Ukraine. The rules have been simplified to deal with the consequences\nof the last two crises.\n• The EU will use its budget to fund weapons and ammunition supplies to Ukraine.\nIn all these instances, the EU is using its powers to reach further into national policies to provide a unified response on critical issues. Use of the EU budget\nand reliance on EU institutions such as the European Semester to monitor and engage in dialogue with member states show the EU’s ambition with\nregards to continued integration. If member states engage, this could help improve the strength of the Union.\nConclusion\nThe war in Ukraine is a grave humanitarian crisis and it has created significant challenges for the global economy. Twelve months on, however, the global\neconomy is displaying signs of resilience and is starting to move on. Unfortunately, the war itself does not look as though it will come to an end soon,\nwhich means that the people of Ukraine continue to suffer.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\n© 2023 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
