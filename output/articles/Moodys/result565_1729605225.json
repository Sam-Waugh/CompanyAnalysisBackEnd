The legislation is born\nout of the Build Back Better agenda that President Biden proposed more than a year ago. It raises\nnearly $750 billion over the next decade through higher taxes on large corporations and wealthy\nindividuals and lower Medicare prescription drug costs, to pay for nearly $450 billion in tax breaks and\nadditional government spending to address climate change and pay for lower health insurance premiums\nfor Americans benefiting from the Affordable Care Act (see Table 1). The remaining more than $300 billion\ngoes to reducing the federal government’s future budget deficits (see Chart 1). Broadly, the legislation will\nnudge the economy and inflation in the right direction, while meaningfully addressing climate change and\nreducing the government’s budget deficits.\nTable 1: Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\nStatic budget effect, calendar yr, $ bil\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2022-2027 2022-2031\nNet budget effect 0.2 -27.2 -7.4 6.6 -1.2 -18.9 -42.3 -57.3 -73.2 -84.0 -29.1 -304.8\nInvestments 0.1 24.7 43.7 56.6 48.1 52.1 55.1 52.6 50.5 49.6 173.2 433.0\nClimate and energy provisions 0.1 12.6 20.7 32.5 43.3 52.1 55.1 52.6 50.5 49.6 109.2 369.0\nExtension of enhanced ACA premium\n0.0 12.1 23.0 24.0 4.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 64.0 64.0\nsubsidies\nPay-fors 0.1 -52.0 -51.1 -50.0 -49.3 -71.1 -97.4-109.8-123.6-133.6 -202.3 -737.8\n15% corporate alternative minimum tax 0.0 -50.3 -47.4 -31.8 -26.8 -26.8 -29.0 -31.4 -33.7 -36.0 -156.2 -313.1\nPrescription drug pricing reforms 0.0 -2.0 -3.0 -13.1 -12.1 -28.4 -47.6 -53.3 -61.5 -66.6 -30.2 -287.6\nIRS funding to close the tax gap 0.1 1.6 0.8 -3.6 -9.1 -14.4 -19.3 -23.7 -26.9 -29.5 -10.2 -124.0\nCarried interest loophole 0.0 -1.2 -1.6 -1.5 -1.4 -1.4 -1.4 -1.5 -1.5 -1.5 -5.7 -13.0\nSources: CBO, JCT, Moody’s Analytics\nInflation Reduction Act\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is a scaled back version of part of the Build Back Better agenda proposed by\nBiden early in his administration. When the BBB was first proposed, it included fiscal support for the\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Assessing the MAcroeconoMic consequences of the inflAtion reduction Act of 2022 2Chart 1: Much to Like in the Inflation Reduction Act\nStatic budget effect, % of GDP\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.2\nNet effect\n-0.3\n-0.4\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\nEnergy security and climate change Affordable Care Act extension 15% corporate minimum tax\nPrescription drug pricing reform IRS tax enforcement Carried interest loophole\nSources: CBO, JCT, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Inflation Reduction Act, August 2022 1\nnation’s infrastructure, a range of social programs, and climate change. In their entirety, these BBB invest-\nments would have cost nearly $4.5 trillion over a 10-year budget horizon, mostly paid for with tax increases\non large corporations and high-income, wealthy households. A version of the infrastructure legislation\nbecame law last summer, and if the Inflation Reduction Act gets across the legislative finish line, Biden will\nhave gotten almost one-quarter of the BBB agenda that he had originally proposed to Congress into law.\nClimate change\nThe bulk of the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act, costing an estimated $370 billion over 10 years,\nare directed toward promoting clean energy and climate resilience. Two-thirds of this amount is in the form\nof federal tax credits that extend, enhance or create incentives to produce electricity from clean energy\nsources, invest in renewable energy technologies, and address climate change through carbon sequestra-\ntion, renewable fuel production, and clean energy manufacturing. These tax expenditures will also lower the\ncost to households and businesses of investing in energy efficiency and purchasing electric vehicles.\nThe other one-third of the legislation’s clean energy and climate investments represent appropriations by\nthe federal government. These include funds to support conservation practices that will help mitigate emis-\nsions from agriculture and forestry. Grants, rebates and federal procurement will promote the adoption of\nclean energy technologies, as well as energy efficiency improvements in housing. The legislation also in-\nvests in the climate resilience of at-risk communities and addresses air pollution.\nThe climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act will meaningfully reduce carbon emissions, and thus the\nacute and chronic physical risks and economic losses resulting from climate change. Physical risks result\nfrom inaction on addressing climate change and global temperature rise, which cause serious changes in the\nphysical world. Acute physical risks are natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires and floods, which are\noccurring more frequently and with greater intensity because of rising temperatures. These disasters cause\nlarge economic losses, only some of which are insured, pressuring governments to provide disaster relief.\nChronic physical risks are the fallout of rising temperatures over longer periods of time, often decades, and\ninclude sea level rise caused in part by melting polar ice caps, and oppressive heat. Chronic physical risks\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Assessing the MAcroeconoMic consequences of the inflAtion reduction Act of 2022 3weigh on labor force productivity growth; have serious consequences for agriculture, tourism and other in-\ndustries; and cause significant changes in global immigration.\nWe estimate the reduction in CO2 emissions due to provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act based on work\ndone by the REPEAT project. By 2050, we estimate emissions will be reduced by nearly 30% compared with\na scenario in which there is no additional policy changes to address climate change (see Chart 2). This is not\nquite as much as would have occurred if the $555 billion in clean energy spending from the original BBB\nproposal had become law, but it is substantial.\nChart 2: Lower Carbon Emissions Under the Inflation Reduction Act\nU.S. CO emissions from fossil fuels, mil of metric tons\n2\n5,500\n5,000\n4,500\n4,000\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nNo additional action Build Back Better Inflation Reduction Act\nSources: EIA, REPEAT, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Inflation Reduction Act, August 2022 2\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also mitigates the economic cost of inaction. Compared with the scenario\nwhere no additional climate change action is taken by government, real GDP is approximately 0.1% higher\na decade from now because of the Inflation Reduction Act, 0.6% higher by 2050, and 2.7% higher by 2100\n(see Chart 3). The clear lesson is that upfront investments in addressing climate change reap substantial\nlong-term economic benefits.\nHealthcare\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also extends enhancements to the Affordable Care Act provided in last year’s\npandemic relief package, the American Rescue Plan. The ARP expanded eligibility for the premium tax cred-\nits to Americans with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level to purchase health insurance on\nACA marketplaces. The law also increased the size of the premium subsidies, thereby reducing or eliminat-\ning out-of-pocket premiums for millions of ACA enrollees. Under current law, these enhancements to the\npremium tax credits expire at the end of this year; the Inflation Reduction Act would extend them through\n2025 at a 10-year cost of some $64 billion.\nAccording to the Urban Institute, if the enhanced premium tax credits lapse as in current law, the number\nof uninsured people will increase by more than 3 million, and these individuals will consume less healthcare\nthan if they remained insured, contributing to a more than $11 billion hit to spending on health services and\ngoods. Moreover, those who continue to buy insurance on the ACA marketplaces, typically with incomes of\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Assessing the MAcroeconoMic consequences of the inflAtion reduction Act of 2022 4Chart 3: The Economic Cost of Climate Inaction Is Severe\nReal GDP, % reduction due to physical risk\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8\n-9\n-10\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nNo additional action Build Back Better Inflation Reduction Act\nSources: Aon, NGFS, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Inflation Reduction Act, August 2022 3\nbetween 150% and 400% of the federal poverty level, would see their insurance premiums more than dou-\nble, making it cost prohibitive for many.\nTaxes on corporations and the wealthy\nTo pay for the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act, large corporations and wealthy, high-income\ntaxpayers will pay more taxes. Most significantly, some $313 billion over 10 years in revenues would come\nfrom a new 15% minimum tax on book income for large companies that report large profits to investors but\nhave little or no taxable profits. There will also be stiffer tax enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service\nto ensure greater taxpayer compliance at a time when the tax gap—the difference between the taxes owed\nunder law and revenue collected—is large and increasing. On net, stronger IRS enforcement will reduce the\ncumulative deficit by $124 billion over 10 years. The legislation will also tax more carried interest that gen-\neral partners of investment funds receive for implementing investment management services as ordinary\nincome, raising $13 billion in additional revenue over 10 years.\nThe tax increases included in the Inflation Reduction Act will weigh on economic growth, all else being\nequal, but the impact will be small. Though the tax increases being considered are the most meaningful\nones since the early 1990s, they are still modest from a historical perspective (see Chart 4).\nThe tax increases on large corporations will also not appreciably hurt economic growth. This conclusion is\nsupported by the experience with the large tax cuts corporations received under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nof 2017. This includes the reduction in the top marginal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. There is little\nevidence that the TCJA led to a meaningful sustained increase in business investment, hiring or wages, or\nprompted businesses to shift production to the U.S. from overseas as intended. Although it is difficult to\ndisentangle all that is going on in the economy to isolate the impacts of the TCJA, it is also difficult to con-\nclude that the TCJA’s tax cuts have meaningfully supported a stronger economy. Therefore, the corporate\ntax increases in the Inflation Reduction Act should not have an appreciable impact on the economy, espe-\ncially given that the effective corporate tax rate has steadily declined for decades and is close to a record\nlow (see Chart 5).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Assessing the MAcroeconoMic consequences of the inflAtion reduction Act of 2022 5Chart 4: Tax Increases Will Not Be Overly Burdensome on U.S. Economy\nAvg annual revenue raised following 1-2 yrsafter enactment, % of GDP\n5\nX-axis=major tax legislation since WWI\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nSources: Romer & Romer, U.S. Treasury, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics Inflation Reduction Act, August 2022 4\nChart 5: Effective Corporate Tax Rate Is Low and Has Steadily Fallen\nEffective tax rate for domestic corporate businesses, %\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20\nSources: BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nPMoroedy’ss Acnarlyiticpstion drug savings Inflation Reduction Act, August 2022 5\nBesides higher taxes on large corporations and well-to-do households, the Inflation Reduction Act includes\nseveral provisions that will, on net, reduce federal healthcare costs. Most notably, it allows Medicare to\nnegotiate lower prices for single-source prescription drugs—drugs only available as the original brand with-\nout competing generic equivalents from other manufacturers—on which it spends the most. From 2026 to\n2029, the number of important drugs subject to negotiations with Medicare would double from 10 to 20.\nIn addition, the legislation will require drug companies that raise prices for Medicare and private insurance\nmore quickly than the rate of inflation to pay rebates to the federal government to cover the difference. Other\nprescription drug savings would come from repealing a Trump-era rule that will eliminate legal safe harbor\nfrom a federal anti-kickback law for rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to health plans and phar-\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Assessing the MAcroeconoMic consequences of the inflAtion reduction Act of 2022 6macy benefit managers in Medicare Part D. Other smaller but meaningful changes to Medicare will include\ncapping annual out-of-pocket drug expenses for enrollees to $2,000; making vaccines free; and expanding eli-\ngibility for the Low-Income Subsidy, which helps beneficiaries pay for prescription drugs. Taken together, these\npolicy changes will cumulatively reduce the nation’s budget deficits by $288 billion over the next decade.\nMacroeconomic impact\nAs named, the Inflation Reduction Act will modestly reduce inflation over the 10-year budget hori-\nzon. By the fourth quarter of 2031, the consumer price inflation index will be 0.33% lower because of the\nlegislation (see Table 2). This translates into a reduction in CPI inflation of 3.3 basis points per annum on\nTable 2: Inflation and GDP Impact of the Inflation Reduction Act\nConsumer Price Index (1982-84=100) Real GDP (2012$ bil)\nBaseline Inflation Reduction Act % difference Baseline Inflation Reduction Act % difference\n2022Q1 284.6 284.6 0.00 19,727.9 19,727.9 0.00\n2022Q2 290.9 290.9 0.00 19,705.4 19,705.4 0.00\n2022Q3 293.7 293.7 0.00 19,824.5 19,824.5 0.00\n2022Q4 296.1 296.1 0.00 19,922.8 19,923.2 0.00\n2023Q1 298.0 298.0 -0.00 20,007.7 20,009.3 0.01\n2023Q2 299.7 299.7 -0.00 20,100.5 20,102.3 0.01\n2023Q3 301.2 301.2 -0.01 20,220.9 20,220.3 -0.00\n2023Q4 302.6 302.5 -0.01 20,355.0 20,349.2 -0.03\n2024Q1 304.3 304.3 -0.01 20,505.6 20,493.6 -0.06\n2024Q2 306.0 306.0 -0.01 20,651.7 20,634.2 -0.08\n2024Q3 307.8 307.8 -0.01 20,794.8 20,774.5 -0.10\n2024Q4 309.7 309.6 -0.01 20,934.6 20,916.8 -0.09\n2025Q1 311.5 311.4 -0.02 21,066.0 21,055.0 -0.05\n2025Q2 313.2 313.2 -0.02 21,203.5 21,201.0 -0.01\n2025Q3 315.0 315.0 -0.02 21,342.2 21,346.7 0.02\n2025Q4 316.8 316.7 -0.03 21,491.0 21,499.0 0.04\n2026Q1 318.6 318.5 -0.04 21,640.2 21,648.2 0.04\n2026Q2 320.4 320.3 -0.05 21,784.9 21,791.5 0.03\n2026Q3 322.2 322.0 -0.06 21,926.9 21,932.3 0.02\n2026Q4 324.0 323.7 -0.08 22,068.3 22,074.5 0.03\n2027Q1 325.6 325.3 -0.09 22,206.9 22,216.4 0.04\n2027Q2 327.3 327.0 -0.10 22,339.1 22,352.8 0.06\n2027Q3 329.0 328.6 -0.12 22,477.7 22,495.6 0.08\n2027Q4 330.8 330.3 -0.13 22,617.8 22,638.9 0.09\n2028Q1 332.5 332.0 -0.15 22,754.9 22,778.4 0.10\n2028Q2 334.3 333.7 -0.16 22,892.1 22,917.7 0.11\n2028Q3 336.1 335.5 -0.18 23,030.3 23,058.2 0.12\n2028Q4 337.9 337.2 -0.19 23,166.5 23,195.8 0.13\n2029Q1 339.7 339.0 -0.20 23,299.3 23,329.9 0.13\n2029Q2 341.5 340.7 -0.22 23,430.5 23,461.9 0.13\n2029Q3 343.3 342.5 -0.23 23,560.7 23,592.7 0.14\n2029Q4 345.2 344.3 -0.25 23,688.2 23,720.6 0.14\n2030Q1 347.0 346.1 -0.26 23,812.8 23,845.9 0.14\n2030Q2 348.9 348.0 -0.27 23,936.5 23,971.0 0.14\n2030Q3 350.9 349.9 -0.28 24,059.9 24,096.4 0.15\n2030Q4 352.8 351.7 -0.29 24,184.2 24,223.1 0.16\n2031Q1 354.7 353.7 -0.30 24,309.0 24,350.5 0.17\n2031Q2 356.7 355.6 -0.31 24,435.9 24,480.2 0.18\n2031Q3 358.6 357.5 -0.32 24,565.2 24,611.9 0.19\n2031Q4 360.6 359.4 -0.33 24,692.2 24,740.7 0.20\nSources: BLS, BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Assessing the MAcroeconoMic consequences of the inflAtion reduction Act of 2022 7average over the period. Through the middle of this decade the impact of the legislation on inflation is\nmarginal, but it becomes more meaningful later in the decade.\nThe legislation weighs on inflation in several ways. Most immediately is through fiscal restraint, as the\nbudget deficit narrows largely because of the taxes on corporations, and results in slower growth. The\nimpact on inflation is small, however, as these growth effects are small. Moreover, large corporations will\nattempt to pass through some of their higher tax bill to consumers in higher prices for their wares—this\nwill be difficult in competitive markets. The extension of the ACA premium tax credits is also important to\nquickly reducing inflation, as health insurance costs will rise next year for millions of Americans without\nthe extension.\nWeighing on inflation by mid-decade are the reforms to Medicare drug pricing, most importantly being\nMedicare’s ability to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The climate change provisions\nin the legislation become an increasing headwind to inflation later in the decade. The energy provisions in\nthe Inflation Reduction Act, for example, could reduce the typical American household’s spending on ener-\ngy by an estimated more than $300 per year in today’s dollars. Lower property and casualty insurance rates\nfor businesses and homeowners and flood insurance for households due to the reduction in emissions and\nphysical risk also lean against inflation.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act will also add to real GDP over the 10-year horizon, although here too the impacts\nwill be small, adding an estimated 0.2% to the level of real GDP by the fourth quarter of 2031. This translates\ninto 2 basis points of growth per annum on average over the period. The impact on GDP is on the margin, even\na bit negative, through mid-decade, but turns meaningfully positive in the second half of the decade.\nConclusion\nIt appears increasingly likely that the Inflation Reduction Act will get through the budget reconciliation\nprocess requiring all 50 Senate Democrats to vote for the legislation and become law. The legislation marks\na major breakthrough in an arduous series of more than yearlong negotiations between Senate Democrats\nover passing some form of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. Up until this past week the negotiations had\nseemingly collapsed. Moody’s Analytics will likely incorporate its provisions into the August 2022 baseline\n(most likely) forecast for the U.S. economy.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is much smaller in scale and scope than the original Build Back Better agenda\nfrom which it comes. Regardless, it will have a material beneficial economic impact. Most immediately\nit provides financial help to millions of lower-income and elderly Americans with their health insurance\npremiums and prescription drug costs. It is also the first meaningful effort by the federal government to\naddress climate change and its long-run corrosive economic effects. Moreover, all of this is more than paid\nfor and will thus reduce the government’s future budget deficits, which seems sure to soon become a more\npressing economic problem. While modest legislation, there is plenty to like in the Inflation Reduction Act.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS Assessing the MAcroeconoMic consequences of the inflAtion reduction Act of 2022 8About the Authors\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
