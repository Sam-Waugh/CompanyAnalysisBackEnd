Introduction\nAll credit portfolios, whether global, regional, corporate, small and midsize enterprises (SME), commercial real\nestate (CRE), or retail, face uncertainty in losses. For example, Figure 1 depicts the delinquency rates for U.S. real\nestate, commercial and industrial (C&I), and consumer (retail) loans from 1987 to 2020. Looking at the figure, it is\nevident that variation in credit quality is substantial and default risk can increase quickly and in correlation with the\nmacro-environment. Even in the aggregate, loss variability cannot be eliminated completely by diversification.\nCoupled with tight lending margins, even small miscalculations in risk and pricing can undermine profitability.1\nWith this in mind, credit risk can be substantially reduced through managed diversification. As investors adopt a\ndiversification measurement, credit risk, and the rewards for bearing it, will ultimately be owned by those who can\ndiversify it best. The challenge for every risk or portfolio manager is to measure and understand the economic risks\nin their portfolio, and ensure they are properly compensated. An active portfolio manager cannot do this without\npractical and conceptually sound methods for both measuring diversification and determining portfolio holdings to\nminimize risk concentrations and maximize return in credit portfolios.\nDelinquency rates on U.S. loans.\nTo address the challenges faced by credit risk or credit portfolio managers, RiskFrontier models each credit\ninvestment’s value at the analysis date, its distribution of returns over an investment horizon, and the joint credit\nrisk with all other instruments in the portfolio. The approach is designed to explicitly analyze a wide range of credit\ninvestments and contingencies, including term loans with prepayment options and grid pricing, dynamic utilization\nin revolving lines of credit, bonds with put and call options, equities, credit default swaps, and structured\ninstruments. Moreover, RiskFrontier’s open framework provides users with tremendous flexibility in specifying the\nvaluation approach, migration model, and correlations. As such, RiskFrontier produces a quantitative set of\nactionable goals for portfolio management based on a granular model that can be tailored to the specific needs of\nan organization.\n1 For an additional discussion, see Kealhofer and Bohn (2001).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 3The portfolio model provides accurate economic estimates of portfolio risk measured as economic capital (i.e., Value-\nat-Risk, or VaR), unexpected loss (i.e., standard deviation, or UL), or expected shortfall (i.e., Conditional Value-at-Risk,\nor CVaR). It also provides accurate estimates of portfolio-referent risk (i.e. marginal contribution to portfolio risk) for\neach instrument in the portfolio, measured as risk contribution (i.e., marginal contribution to portfolio standard\ndeviation) and tail risk contribution (i.e., marginal contribution to portfolio tail loss or VaR). The aforesaid portfolio\nand instrument risk measures account for concentration/diversification across dimensions such as country and\nindustry, as well as reference name concentration. The model does so through a bottom-up approach that considers\nthe following:\n» Variation in instrument level inputs (e.g., holding amount, loss given default (LGD), tenure,\ncontingencies, and fees).\n» Variation in borrower level inputs (e.g. probability of default (PD), term structure of PD, size (sales or\nassets), industry, geography, and, if applicable, retail product or real estate property type).\n» Variation in correlations across borrowers through a correlation model, such as the Moody’s\nAnalytics Global Correlation Model(GCorr™).2 GCorr is a multi-factor correlation model —\nconsisting of close to 1,000 geographical, sectoral, and national and regional macroeconomic factors\n— is updated and validated annually and is based on a long time series of empirical and granular data\ncapturing intra- and inter-asset class correlations for a broad range of asset classes (public and private\nfirms, CRE, retail, sovereign, and project finance).\n» Using aforesaid instrument- and borrower-level inputs together with valuation, credit migration,\nGCorr, and Monte Carlo simulation models and framework, RiskFrontier calculates return, portfolio-\nreferent risk, and return/risk (risk-adjusted performance) measures for each instrument in the\nportfolio, as well as for segments, sub-portfolios, and the overall portfolio. With this granular view,\nRiskFrontier supports portfolio- and instrument-level actions including pricing, approval, limit\nsetting, position sizing, hedging, selling, and structuring. It facilitates the comparison of\ncompensation for portfolio-referent credit risk against the amount of capital allocated to support a\nparticular investment. It is important to note that return and portfolio-referent risk measures, such\nas risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC), provide the portfolio manager with a rank ordering of\nthe most beneficial and detrimental investments based on their marginal impact on portfolio\nreturn/risk. The analysis guides the manager in improving portfolio performance by\nrecommending where to focus additional investments, and indicating where hedging is needed.\n» In addition, RiskFrontier can help financial institutions assess and ensure capital adequacy from\neconomic, accounting, and regulatory perspectives. Specifically, RiskFrontier is designed not only\nto measure required economic capital and quantify credit risk concentrations, but also to address\nrequirements such as stress testing. More generally, RiskFrontier functionality addresses the Pillar 2\nsupervisory review processes.3\nTo summarize, the portfolio model behind RiskFrontier helps the risk manager or portfolio manager overcome the\nhigh- dimensional problem associated with measuring and managing portfolio-referent risk and return of the\nunderlying investments in the portfolio. The remainder of this document provides an overview of how RiskFrontier\naddresses these challenges. This paper is organized as follows:\n» Section 2 discusses the valuation methodologies.\n» Section 3 explains how the risk and return of each individual investment is modeled within the portfolio.\n» Section 4 provides an overview of the Global Correlation model (GCorr), as well as a discussion of other\ncorrelation models that can be utilized in RiskFrontier\n» Section 5 explains the Monte Carlo methods that amalgamate instrument-level valuation and risk-and-\n2 For more information, see “Modeling Credit Correlations: An Overview of the Moody’s Analytics GCorr Model” by Huang, Lanfranconi, Patel, and Pospisil (2012).\n3 For detailed discussions, see Gibbon (2007).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 4return analysis with correlations to build up the value/loss distribution for the portfolio, and provide\nactionable portfolio-referent risk measures for each instrument. This section also reviews several features\nassociated with Monte Carlo analysis, including DealAnalyzer®, which allows for portfolio-referent risk-and-\nreturn calculations to be conducted rapidly for a new investment or hedge position without reanalyzing the\nentire credit portfolio.\n» Section 6 describes RiskFrontier’s key business applications.\n2. Valuation\nValuation is fundamental to credit portfolio analysis. Given the lack of market prices for most credit instruments, an\naccurate model is essential. The valuation model used in marking a portfolio to market can have dramatic effects\non the perceived portfolio values, as well as the rank-ordering of instruments’ return and portfolio-referent risk. A\nportfolio or risk manager must ensure an economically consistent valuation approach that correctly handles the\nspecifics of each instrument across the entire portfolio.\nWithin the context of RiskFrontier, there are two classes of valuation models: the valuation models used to analyze\nsingle-name instruments (e.g., loans or bonds), and models used for structured instruments (e.g., CDOs). We\ndiscuss horizon value distribution in Section 3.\n2.1 Single-Name Credit Instruments\nIn the spirit of the open framework, RiskFrontier provides substantial modeling flexibility on the valuation front.\nBroadly speaking, users can value instruments using book-style methodologies, market-based measures (e.g.,\nprices), or the Moody’s Analytics lattice valuation method.4 The approach that best fits an institution depends\non its needs. In practice, institutions utilize differing approaches across their sub-portfolios if, for example,\nmarket prices are not consistently available for some sub-portfolio. Moreover, many institutions analyze their\nportfolios under multiple settings to get different views of their portfolio value, such as book value versus mark-\nto-market.\nUnder book value, the value of an instrument is par less amortized upfront fees. While book value provides a\nsense for the instrument value at origination (value is typically near par at origination), it does not adjust in any\nway for changes in the credit quality of the underlying reference entity. Book valuation can be very useful for\nevaluating the performance of an instrument’s contractual pricing. It is also useful in that it can easily align\nwith an institution’s other systems that recognize only value changes resulting from cash losses.\nIf data are available, users can utilize market prices or credit curves (through spreads or matrix pricing) to value\ninstruments. This option is useful for instruments that are either the same as or similar to instruments that are\ntraded regularly. Although the application of prices is straightforward (value is equal to price), valuation using\ncredit curves entails employing a reference rate to discount contractually promised cash flows. It is important\nto understand the caveat that applying credit curves from one market or instrument to another can lead to\nerroneous analysis. This is relevant when instruments have different terms and conditions that impact their\nrespective spreads. As will be demonstrated below, this issue is addressed in the lattice structure, which\nexplicitly models terms and conditions.\nThe lattice structure values an instrument using a bottom-up approach. Cash flows are modeled as a function\nof the contract as well as the state of a reference entity’s credit quality. The structure lends itself to the explicit\nmodeling of credit contingencies. Figure 2 provides a simplified visual illustration of the lattice structure. Credit\nstates for the reference entity are represented on the vertical axis, and time is represented on the horizontal\n4 For a detailed discussion of the non-lattice valuation methodologies, see “Modeling Credit Portfolios.” For additional details regarding the\nlattice models, see “Modeling Credit Portfolios,” and Levy, Hu, and Li, (2007).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 5axis. A time-credit state combination is referred to as a “node.” The probability of migrating from any one node\nto another at a subsequent time point is captured by the transition probabilities, which can be based on the\nMoody’s Analytics Empirical Credit Migration model, or on a user-provided transition matrix (e.g., rating-based\nmigration). The default state is an absorbing state, so all transition probabilities from the default state to non-\ndefault states are zero.\nThe lattice.\nAnalysis Date\nAs Figure 3 demonstrates, the lattice allows for the modeling of credit qualities over time, credit migration\nprobabilities, and credit-contingent cash flows. Given these, one can model contingencies that are a function of the\nreference entity’s credit state. For example, the nodes for which a prepayment option on a loan is exercised can be\ndetermined by comparing the value of the instrument as an ongoing concern with the value to the borrower\nassociated with prepayment.\nValuation within the lattice structure is conducted recursively backward in time. Starting at the second to last\nperiod, expected cash flows from the last period are discounted back to arrive at a continuation value at each node;\nfor a plain vanilla loan there is no uncertainty in the value of the non-default nodes in the last period, so no\ncalculation is necessary. Note that the default probability depends on the node; starting at a high node (i.e., a high\ncredit quality) will result in a lower probability of default and higher value. The value will typically be lower for lower\ncredit quality nodes. After adding any accumulated cash flows (e.g., interest payments, amortized principal, or\nprepayment penalties), the values for nodes in the preceding period are computed, taking into account\ncontingencies, if any.\nA few subtleties are worth pointing out. First, a separate lattice is constructed for each instrument. After all,\ncontingencies and terms and conditions are instrument-specific, and so cash flows at each node are instrument-\nspecific. Second, the probability of reaching a node is specific to the reference entity. This follows from the fact that\nmigration probabilities depend on the default probability term structure for the reference entity; the default\nprobability term structure can be different for each reference entity in the portfolio. Third, valuation requires\ndiscounting cash flows that face risks, such as default risk. Similar to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the\nlattice accounts for the systematic portion of risk in cash flows. However, instead of discounting cash flows at a\nbeta-adjusted rate, the lattice discounts cash flows using risk-neutral valuation techniques.\nThe motivation for using risk-neutral valuation techniques is driven by their computational ease when applied to\nthe problem at hand. These techniques were pioneered by Black and Scholes (1973), and Merton (1973) in their\nseminal work on option pricing. Merton (1974) applied the same analysis to the pricing of corporate liabilities, and\ncreated a structural framework that established the theoretical underpinning of subsequent developments in\nacademic research and industrial application pioneered by Moody’s Analytics. It is important to note that similar to\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 6the CAPM framework, each asset’s covariance with the market determines its systematic risk adjustment; the risk-\nneutral valuation method includes an adjustment for each reference entity’s systematic risk.\nWith the lattice in hand, one can analyze a wide range of dynamics associated with credit contingencies, since an\narbitrary cash flow can be associated with each node. For example, one can model the common observation that\ndeterioration in credit quality is associated with a drawdown of credit lines, as demonstrated in Figure 3. The lattice\naccurately accounts for differing usage and non-usage fees, and the impact of the payoff or drawdown on cash\nflows. In the same spirit, the RiskFrontier lattice models loans with prepayment options or grid pricing, callable or\nputtable bonds, CDSs (explicitly accounting for counterparty risk), custom instruments with described arbitrary cash\nflows, and exposure profiles that capture the credit component of instruments facing risks other than credit risk,\nsuch as counterparty risk of derivatives. The lattice also models equity, both public and private.\nThe lattice structure applied to modeling the dynamic usage pattern in a line of credit.\nAs mentioned, RiskFrontier allows for modeling of migration using the Moody’s Analytics Empirical Credit Migration\nmodel, or through a user-specified credit migration matrix (e.g., a ratings-based migration matrix). The Moody’s\nAnalytics Empirical Credit Migration model uses information from the Moody’s Analytics EDF model to determine\nthe probability of migrating to different credit states. As demonstrated in Dwyer and Qu (2007), the EDF model\nprovides the most accurate point-in-time measure of default probability. As such, an EDF-based migration model\nprovides the most accurate description of how actual point-in-time credit quality (i.e., default probability) evolves.\nAlternatively, users can specify a Moody’s rating transition matrix if the interest is to model migration using a\nthrough-the-cycle measure of credit quality.\nTo get a sense of the dynamics associated with different migration models, Figure 4 presents a Moody’s one-year\nmigration matrix (top left), as well as a Moody’s Analytics EDF-based one-year migration matrix (bottom right).\nAlthough the Moody’s Analytics matrix is not derived directly from the Moody’s Analytics Empirical Credit\nMigration model, it does represent the kind of dynamics observed in the Moody’s Analytics Empirical Credit\nMigration model. In particular, one can see that EDF credit measures are substantially more dynamic (or less sticky)\nthan agency ratings; the probability of remaining within a Baa category is much higher under a ratings-based\napproach than the probability of remaining within an EDF-range that corresponds to a Baa rating.5 This follows\n5 It is worth mentioning that the relationship between EDF measures and ratings can be non-monotonic. As such, this exercise is supposed\nto provide a sense for the dynamics; a formal comparison is much more difficult.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 7from the fact that EDF values measure credit quality at a point-in-time, while Moody’s ratings are through-the-\ncycle measures, and do not change as frequently.6\nA comparison of a Moody’s rating transition matrix and a Moody’s Analytics EDF-based transition matrix.\n2.2 Structured Instruments\nThe challenges of modeling structured instruments are numerous. Much of the complexity stems from the\ndependence of a structure’s cash flows on a collateral pool whose credit qualities are heterogeneous. Understanding\nthe combination of events and associated probabilities that lead to possible cash flow realizations can be\ncomputationally costly. For example, using a lattice structure to value a CDO with 100 reference entities in the\ncollateral pool would require constructing a grid with 100 dimensions (i.e., one for each reference entity). This would\nbe impractical. To avoid these costs, RiskFrontier does not utilize the lattice structure to value structured\ninstruments. Instead, RiskFrontier makes simplifying assumptions and applies an analytic valuation method.\nThe analytic valuation approach is similar to the approaches presented in Gregory and Laurent (2003), and Hull and\nWhite (2004). The methodology relies on two fundamental modeling assumptions. First, the collateral terms and\nconditions, and correlations are assumed to be uniform across the collateral pool.7 Second, losses can be described\nthrough a pass-through waterfall structure. More specifically, losses impact a subordinated class (e.g., a tranche)\nwhen losses on the collateral pool exceed the attachment point. The tranche will be worthless after losses on the\ncollateral pool exceed the detachment point. However, the structured instrument can be parameterized to model\nCDOs, BDSs, CLOs, and asset-backed securities of various types, with different waterfall structures.\nFigure 5 provides a simplified visual representation of the analytic approach. The first step is to build up the loss\ndistribution for the underlying collateral pool at each point in time, as depicted at the top of the figure. Cash flows\n6 This implies that default rates associated with an agency rating varies over time. For example, Baa-rated firms experienced a 10-fold\nincrease in default rates from 1998 to 2001.\n7It is worth noting that the simplified correlation structure is only applied to valuation. As we will discuss shortly, risk and return calculation\nincorporate the rich correlation structure that is available in RiskFrontier.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 8to the tranche can be constructed by mapping the distribution of losses on the collateral pool to losses on the\ntranche, which are based on the attachment point (a) and detachment point (d), as depicted in the lower right-\nhand part of the figure.\nTranche value is computed by discounting risk-neutral expected tranche cash flows back to the analysis date.\nThe analytic valuation approach to modeling structured instruments.\nRiskFrontier allows users to offset distortions associated with the two fundamental modeling assumptions related\nto the analytic valuation method. First, distortions associated with collateral pool homogeneity are offset using\ninformation specific to the deal, as well as available market information. For example, the correlation parameter\nthat is used for pricing can be calibrated to those implied by market prices or an external model.8 It is important to\nnote that the semi-analytic approach used for analyzing risk and return does not rely on homogeneity. For example,\nit leverages the chosen correlation model (e.g., GCorr) along with Monte Carlo techniques and does not have the\nsame shortcomings. Second, users can also offset distortions associated with a pass-through waterfall structure.\nThe attachment point can be calibrated so that the distress probability of the structured instrument corresponds to\nthat produced by a model that accounts for the more complex waterfall structure. Similarly, the detachment point\ncan be calibrated to the loss given distress on the structured instrument. This approach to setting attachment and\ndetachment points allows users to leverage a richer stand-alone valuation tool in a computationally more efficient\nframework that accounts for portfolio concentration effects.\nMoody’s Structured Analytics (SA)-RiskFrontier (RF) data feed: Moody’s Structured Analytics (SA) team maintains a\ndatabase of publicly traded CLO, CMBS, RMBS, and ABS transaction data, a library of complex cash flow rules, and\nsimulation models for assessing tranche level risk. SA-RF data feed automation (i) translates SA transaction data to\nRiskFrontier format, (ii) performs complex calculations, including the aforesaid calibration of attachment and\ndetachment points, based on RiskFrontier analysis outputs to parameterize a CDO (or equivalent bond/loan)\ninstrument to match tranche level risk based on SA simulations and models, and then (iii) loads relevant data and\nimports portfolios of synthetic CDO equivalents into RiskFrontier. This permits analysis of more complex structures,\n8 For a more detailed discussion, see “Modeling Credit Portfolios.”\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 9such as RMBS, CMBS, ABS, or cash CDO with complex waterfalls, in a portfolio context utilizing the RiskFrontier\nCDO module.\n3. Measuring the Stand-Alone Instrument Risk and Return\nWe now discuss how the horizon value distribution is constructed and used, along with the valuation model, to\nmeasure an instrument’s stand-alone risk and return. Similar to valuation, the model that defines the horizon value\ndistribution is fundamental to credit portfolio management. The instrument’s horizon value distribution, when\ncombined with the analysis date value, defines the risk and return of the instrument. As in Section 2, “Valuation,” the\nhorizon valuation models used to analyze single-name instruments (e.g., loans or bonds) are different from those\nthat are used for structured instruments (e.g., CDOs). As such, this section is divided into two parts.\n3.1 Single-name Credit Instruments\nRiskFrontier provides substantial flexibility when modeling the value distribution at horizon. As with analysis-date\nvalue, users can model the distribution incorporating book-style methodologies, default-no-default settings,\nmarket-based measures (e.g., prices or spreads), or utilizing the Moody’s Analytics lattice structure.\nSimilar in spirit to book value, RiskFrontier allows users to define the expected horizon value of an instrument as an\nongoing concern (i.e., conditional on not having defaulted) using a linear or exponential pull-to-par approach. As\nwith book valuation, horizon linear and exponential valuation do not account for changes in the credit quality of\nthe underlying reference entity.\nAs with analysis date valuation, market prices or credit curves (e.g., spreads or matrix pricing) can be used to\ndescribe the horizon value of an instrument as an ongoing concern. In the case of credit curves, the user also\nspecifies the distribution of spreads at horizon. In other words, the Moody’s Analytics Empirical Credit Migration\nmodel is not used in the analysis. Instead, each horizon credit state is associated with a forward credit curve, which,\nalong with the reference rate, is used to discount the remaining promised cash flows. Here, the practitioner must be\naware of the same caveats as in analysis date valuation: applying the distribution of spreads from one market to\nanother can lead to erroneous analysis when instruments have different terms and conditions.\nFinally, at horizon, the user can compute the expected value and value distribution of an instrument using the\nlattice methodology. Figure 6 provides a simplified visual representation of how the horizon value distribution is\nconstructed. In the example, the analysis is conducted to a horizon of two years. The value of the instrument at\neach of the non-default nodes at horizon is a combination of post- and pre-horizon cash flows. These cash flows\ninclude not only coupons or fees, but also any cash flow-associated contingencies, such as prepayment.\nUsing the lattice, valuation of cash flows after horizon is conducted using risk-neutral valuation techniques as\ndiscussed in Section 2.1, “Single-name Credit Instruments,” (i.e., backward induction). In this example, a higher credit\nstate will typically be associated with a higher value, because the probability of default is lower. Cash flows before\nhorizon are assumed to be reinvested at the credit-risk-free rate and aggregated at horizon (i.e., forward). It is worth\npointing out that the different possible paths to a node are considered when aggregating these cash flows.9 The\nsingle default node at horizon actually represents a set of states. That is, in the event of default, recovery value is\nuncertain and is modeled through a beta distribution with parameters from Moody’s Analytics LossCalc™, or a user-\nspecified mean and variance.10\n9 It is assumed that all cash flows realized before horizon are reinvested to horizon at the credit default risk-free rate.\n10 In fact, users can specify an entire term structure for the expected recovery and variance in RiskFrontier. This can be particularly useful when modeling\nproject finance where recovery is typically lower at the initial phases of the project.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 10To arrive at the instrument value distribution in the non-default states, it is necessary to associate a value with each\nhorizon node, as well as a probability of arriving at that node. The probability of arriving at each horizon node is\ncomputed by concatenating the credit migration probability distribution (i.e. the migration matrix) at each time-\nstep before horizon. In Figure 6, there are two time steps before horizon. As such, the probability of arriving at any\nhorizon node is computed by considering the different possible paths that lead to this node. Of course, the default\nnode is an absorbing state. As discussed in Section 2.1, the probability of arriving at a node is determined by the\nchosen credit migration model (e.g., the Moody’s Analytics Empirical Credit Migration model).\nIt is important to stress that for calculating value/loss distribution, return, and risk at the investment horizon, the\nrelevant distribution of states at horizon is the distribution observed in the physical world (i.e., the distribution\nunder the physical measure). For example, for the purpose of risk management, it is relevant to focus on actual\nprobabilities of default and probabilities of the counterparty improving or deteriorating in credit quality. This\nphysical distribution is distinctly different from the distribution under the risk-neutral measure, which is relevant\nwhen valuing risky future cash flows. In other words, the relevant probability of defaulting or migrating to a credit\nstate at horizon is the physical probability. Once that credit state is realized, the value of the instrument can be\ncomputed using risk-neutral valuation techniques that combine future physical probabilities and the investors’ risk\naversion, as expressed in market prices.\nWith the horizon value distribution in the non-default and default states, and the analysis date value in hand, the\ncomputation of risk and return is straightforward. In particular, Unexpected Loss is computed as the standard\ndeviation of the return, and the expected spread, which measures compensation for risk, is computed as the\nexpected return less the credit-risk-free rate.\nHow an instrument’s value distribution at horizon is generated.\n3.2 Structured Instruments\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, “Single-name Credit Instruments,” valuation of a structured instrument is complex and time-\nconsuming. When compared with single-name instruments, the complexity associated with modeling the horizon value\ndistribution is much more for a structured instrument. One challenge is to keep track of the horizon credit states of all\nreference entities in the collateral pool, as they play a role in the horizon value of the structured instrument.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 11Another challenge is to associate a probability to each combination of reference entity credit states. This is coupled\nwith the desired property that the model properly account for credit events associated with reference entities,\nwhich overlap the collateral pool of the structured instrument and other parts of the portfolio.\nTo overcome these challenges, RiskFrontier uses a semi-analytic approach. This approach combines a Monte Carlo\nsimulation, which accurately represents cash losses prior to horizon, with the analytic valuation method (described\nin Section 2.2, “Structured Instruments”), which represents the horizon value of the structured instrument as a\ngoing concern. The analytic horizon value is pre-computed for each point of a two-dimensional grid: one dimension\nis the cumulative loss on the collateral pool to horizon; the other dimension is the average credit quality of the\nremaining principal (average forward 1-year default probability). The structured instrument’s horizon value\ndistribution is constructed by simulating each reference entity’s horizon credit state in accordance with other parts\nof the portfolio. The value from cash flows prior to horizon is then combined with the forward-analytic value from\nthe grid to arrive at a value at horizon.\nIt is important to stress that, within the context of the horizon value distribution, homogeneity is only assumed\nwhen computing the analytic value of the structured instrument as a going concern at each point on the grid.\nMeanwhile, the simulation accurately accounts for heterogeneity in default probability, the likelihood of multiple\ndefaults as implied from the specified correlation model, loss given default, time to maturity, and notional. Thus,\nrisk and return metrics incorporate the heterogeneous characteristics of the collateral pool. In addition, RiskFrontier\nis uniquely able to capture the risk concentration due to reference entities that are common to the collateral pool\nand other parts of the portfolio.\nThe last step of the analysis corrects for inconsistencies between assumptions (e.g., correlation) used in\nconstructing the horizon value distribution, and assumptions used in valuation at the analysis date. To rectify this\ndiscrepancy, the simulated horizon values are shifted by a constant. This constant is set to guarantee that the\ndiscounted expected value (using risk-neutral valuation techniques) is equal to the value at the analysis date.\nFinally, it is worth pointing out that stand-alone risk and return statistics for structured instruments are simulation-\nbased, unlike those for single-name instruments. Unexpected loss is computed as the standard deviation of the return,\nand the expected spread is computed as the expected return less the credit-risk-free rate.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 124. Correlation\nA credit portfolio or structured product is composed of multiple instruments. Clearly, the overall risk of a portfolio\ndepends not only on the risks of the individual instruments, but also on how the future values of these investments\nare correlated. Given the importance of correlation in determining the risk of a portfolio, Moody’s Analytics has\ndeveloped a rich global factor model (GCorr Corporate) that provides pairwise asset (not equity) correlations for\napproximately 33,000 publicly traded firms, the Private Firm R-squared Calculator that provides mid-market\ncorrelations, as well as correlation parameterizations for a wide range of asset classes, such as retail instruments, CRE,\nand asset-backed securities. In addition to the Moody’s Analytics models and data, RiskFrontier provides substantial\nflexibility by allowing specification of an arbitrary factor model or pairwise correlation matrix for reference entities in\nthe portfolio, where the joint distribution can be described through a Normal copula. To facilitate in\nparameterization, the following three structures are available:11, 12\n» Flexible Factor Model. It is an expansion of the Moody’s Analytics factor model (GCorr), in which\nadditional factors (e.g., retail, SME, or CRE factors) are included. This allows users to refine the\ncorrelation model associated with the extended asset classes, while leveraging the richness of\nGCorr in a single unified correlation framework.\n» General Factor Model. It allows users to specify an arbitrary linear factor model. The factors can be\neconomic in nature, or represent latent factors. The general factor model framework requires users\nto specify the covariance matrix between the factors.\n» Pairwise Correlation Model. It provides the most flexibility, because users specify the correlation\nbetween every pair of reference entities in the portfolio.\nRegardless of the specified correlation structure, RiskFrontier utilizes a bottom-up approach where asset\ncorrelations describe the co-movement in borrowers’ credit states, which, together with borrower’s PD and\ninstrument characteristics, impact the co-movement in instrument values that are part of the output.\nParameterized correlations can represent the correlation of credit states to be used to describe the co-movement in\nforward default probabilities as represented in the lattice structure and the Moody’s Analytics Empirical Credit\nMigration model, or, alternatively, the co-movement in credit curves. The details of how the joint movement of\ncredit states is combined with the instrument horizon value distributions to describe the joint distribution of\ninstrument values can be found in the Monte Carlo section that follows.\nThe remainder of this section provides an overview of the GCorr Corporate model, which uses a factor model rather\nthan direct historical observations to measure asset return correlations between firms. The factor model approach\nleverages information in areas where data are plentiful and allows for inference in areas where data are scarce and\nnoisy. Zeng and Zhang (2001) use extensive empirical data to show that historical correlations are subject to a large\namount of sampling error, thereby limiting their usefulness in predicting future correlations. The predictive power of\na factor model, in contrast, stems largely from its control over these errors. A good follow-up paper is Zhang, Zhu,\nand Lee (2008), which provides a link between the predicted default correlations from the GCorr Corporate model\nand correlations implied directly from realized corporate defaults.\nSome practitioners have expressed valid concerns about measuring default correlations since they are difficult to\nestimate; defaults are infrequent and typically occur once, at most, for any entity. The approach described below\ncleverly addresses this dynamic aspect of default correlations by decomposing default (and value) correlations into\ntwo component pieces: asset (business value) correlation, which is relatively less dynamic, and credit quality (PD),\nwhich is enormously dynamic and requires forward-looking measures and constant monitoring. The description\nbelow is about the estimation of firm-level asset correlations. The RiskFrontier user can then put these together with\nhighly predictive credit quality measures and get a useful, predictive, and actionable view of portfolio risk.\n11 For a detailed discussion of the correlation module, see “Modeling Credit Portfolios.”\n12 The Private Firm R-squared Calculator can be used to estimate asset correlation between private firms and between private firms and\nother assets in the credit portfolio.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 13A factor model approach imposes a structure on the correlation of asset returns. The correlation between the asset\nreturns of any pair of firms can be explained by the firms’ relationships to a set of common factors. In particular,\nGCorr Corporate can be thought of as having a factor model within a factor model. To begin, a firm’s credit risk can\nbe decomposed into a systematic component (i.e., the firm’s composite factor) and a firm-specific (i.e., idiosyncratic)\ncomponent; this can be thought of as the first factor model. The systematic component can be described by a\nsecond factor structure. In particular, a firm’s composite factor is defined by the firm’s industry and country\ncomposition. The dynamics are driven by industry- and country-specific loadings on a set of global, regional, and\nindustrial sector factors that are common to all countries and industries. Furthermore, each industry and country has\na specific (i.e. idiosyncratic) risk component that is unrelated to other industry- and country-specific risks. Thus, the\nGCorr Corporate asset correlation between two firms is defined by the covariance between the two respective\ncomposite factors, along with the correlation between each firm and its own composite factor. More formally, the\nvariables that define the GCorr Corporate correlation structure are the following:\n» The relation between a firm and its composite factor (this is referred to as R-squared or RSQ).\n» A firm’s industry and country composition.\n» The loadings on the common global, regional, and industrial sectors that define the correlation\nbetween industry-country combinations.\nFigure 7 provides a visual representation of the Moody’s Analytics GCorr Corporate factor structure. Starting from\nthe top, a firm’s risk is decomposed into systematic and firm-specific risk; this decomposition is determined by the\nfirm’s R- squared. The systematic risk is defined by the firm’s industry and country composition (i.e., a composite\nfactor). As demonstrated in the bottom row, dynamics for each industry and country are defined by loadings on the\nglobal, regional, and industrial sectors. The remaining industry and country risks are specific to the respective industry\nand country.\nThe GCorr Corporate Factor Structure.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 145. Bringing it All Together with Monte Carlo Simulation\nSo far, this document has provided an overview of valuation models, models describing horizon value distribution at\nthe instrument level, and the correlation module (along with GCorr). This section describes how these components\nare used in the Monte Carlo engine to construct the portfolio value distribution and to calculate portfolio-referent\nrisk statistics.\nAs discussed above, the problem of analytically computing the joint distribution of returns for a credit portfolio is a\ndaunting task. Instead of describing the joint distribution analytically, the Monte Carlo engine samples from the\njoint distribution of credit states as defined by the correlation model. The engine then utilizes the mapping between\ncredit state and instrument value (available through the instrument horizon value distribution) to sample from the\njoint distribution of instrument values. Said another way, the Monte Carlo engine simulates the credit states of the\nworld for the underlying reference entities in the portfolio, and then maps credit states to corresponding values for\neach instrument. By simulating a large number of trials, where each trial represents one combination of credit\nstates for all the reference entities, one can obtain a description of the joint distribution of instrument values, and,\nas a result, the portfolio value (or loss) distribution.\nFigure 8 provides a visual representation of the simulation for two firms. Focusing on the graph in the top right, the\nx-axis represents the credit state for reference entity X, and the y-axis represents the credit state for reference entity\nY. Ovals on the graph represent iso-probability curves for the joint distribution of credit states. Curves in the center\nhave a higher probability mass and those further out have less, indicating that extreme credit states are less likely.\nThe fact that the ovals are squeezed toward the top right and bottom left indicates that the credit states are\ncorrelated; reference entity X is more likely to realize a bad credit state if reference entity Y realizes a bad credit state\n(at horizon).\nTo aid with the visual representation, the marginal distribution of credit states for reference entities X and Y are\nplotted along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The shaded portion of the left x-axis and bottom y-axis represents\nthe default states for reference entities X and Y, respectively. Meanwhile, the value of each instrument, as a function\nof credit state, is depicted on the top left and bottom right. In each trial, the Monte Carlo engine samples from the\njoint distribution of credit states. This is done by simulating the underlying factors as defined by the correlation\nmodel, associating the factor loadings for each reference entity to arrive at the systematic portion of the reference\nentity’s risk. In addition, an idiosyncratic shock is simulated for each firm to arrive at a credit state for each firm. If the\nrealized credit state falls below the default threshold, a random recovery amount is simulated. If the reference entity\nis not in default, the credit state is mapped onto a going-concern instrument value.\nComputing portfolio and portfolio-referent risk statistics is straightforward after a large sample of instrument values\nis simulated. For portfolio-level statistics, instrument values can be aggregated for each trial to arrive at a sample of\nportfolio values. Unexpected Loss (i.e., standard deviation or UL) for the portfolio can be estimated by taking the\nstandard deviation of the sample. Similarly, portfolio capital can be computed by looking at the loss threshold\nassociated with a particular target probability. Meanwhile, portfolio-referent risk statistics, i.e. an instrument’s\nmarginal contribution to portfolio risk, can be computed by relating the instrument value with the portfolio value.\nThe covariance between the instrument value and the portfolio value can be estimated for the purpose of\ncomputing instrument-level risk contribution i.e., instrument’s marginal contribution to portfolio standard deviation\n(i.e. portfolio UL).\nMeanwhile, Tail-Risk Contribution (i.e., marginal contribution to tail or extreme portfolio loss) is computed by\nkeeping track of the loss on each instrument when the portfolio falls within the user-specified (tail) loss interval.\nHaving laid out the mechanics of how the portfolio and portfolio-referent risk statistics are computed, it is worth\nconsidering the economics of when it is relevant to focus on each of the measures. In particular, an institution’s\npreferences should determine which statistics are most relevant. For example, an institution whose primary focus is\nto minimize the year-to-year changes in portfolio value should probably focus on portfolio UL and each\ninstrument’s marginal contribution to portfolio UL (i.e., risk contribution). If, instead, an institution’s primary focus\nis to minimize the likelihood of incurring extreme losses (e.g., to protect their Aaa rating), then the focus should\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 15probably be on capital measured at a low target probability, and each instrument’s marginal contribution to those\nextreme outcomes (i.e., Tail- Risk Contribution). In some cases, multiple stakeholders may have different\npreferences. For example, an institution’s shareholders may care about portfolio volatility or UL, while regulators\nmay be concerned with the likelihood of extreme loss. One approach is for the institution to focus on a low target\nprobability capital measure at the portfolio level, and use risk contribution when allocating risk at the instrument\nlevel. Loosely speaking, this approach allows the institution to rank order instruments and optimize its portfolio\nbased on instruments’ marginal impact on portfolio volatility or UL, while assessing and ensuring capital adequacy\nbased on regulatory or economic capital requirements.\nThe Monte Carlo engine.\nThe following four features related to the Monte Carlo engine are worth highlighting:\n» Simulation Services distributes the Monte Carlo calculations across multiple processors and\nmachines. This allows for an improvement in computation speed, as well as an ability to analyze\nportfolios with a large number of instruments. The engine utilizes a Multi-Stream Monte Carlo\napproach that controls the sequence of pseudo-random numbers in such a way that ensures that\nresults are not affected by whether the calculations are performed in a distributed fashion.\n» An importance-sampling approach to simulation is available in RiskFrontier. The methodology\nimproves upon the simulation speed without loss of accuracy. The basic idea behind importance\nsampling is to change the distribution from which the random samples are taken in a way that\npreserves the statistic; asymptotically, as the number of trials approaches infinity, importance\nsampling will produce the same simulated statistics as standard Monte Carlo. A greater concentration\nof the sample is chosen from the region with the greatest impact on the calculation. For computing\nrisk statistics, this means sampling those scenarios that lead to large losses. Although performance is\nportfolio-dependent, the approach frequently reduces the number of simulations by a factor of ten or\nmore (i.e., one-tenth the number of trials are needed to achieve the same level of accuracy).\n» RiskFrontier facilitates the analysis of large homogeneous pools of instruments. The functionality\nallows for accurate analysis of a homogeneous pool of arbitrary size in a fraction of the time it\nwould otherwise take to analyze each instrument individually; it takes about as much time to\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 16analyze the pool as it does a stand-alone instrument. This functionality is useful when, for\nexample, modeling retail pools (e.g., a pool of credit card loans), where the benefits of granularly\nanalyzing characteristics of each borrower and loan may not be sufficient to offset the increased\ncomputation time and data requirements. When modeling instruments using the homogeneous\npool functionality, the model is designed to compute simulated statistics with approximately the\nsame level of accuracy as when the instruments were modeled individually.\n» DealAnalyzer is a calculation engine that brings portfolio analytics to the desktops of loan\noriginators and active managers. DealAnalyzer provides the ability to structure, value, and price\ntransactions accurately in light of existing credit portfolio risk. DealAnalyzer leverages the Multi-\nStream Monte Carlo methodology to analyze the return and portfolio-referent risk characteristics\nof a deal without re-analyzing (re-simulating) the entire portfolio. Intuitively, Multi-Stream Monte\nCarlo allows for the timely regeneration of random sequences simulated for the existing portfolio,\nso that simulated values from the deal can be appropriately associated with values from the\nexisting portfolio’s value distribution, allowing for the computation of risk statistics.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 176. Business Applications\nCredit portfolios, consisting of loans, bonds, and other credit assets, make up a large portion of all assets on most financial\ninstitutions’ balance sheets. Hence, credit portfolio value, return, and risk are key drivers of shareholder/stakeholder value, return,\nand risk. Institutions can increase stakeholder value by increasing portfolio return/risk while also ensuring capital adequacy and\nregulatory compliance. This process, for the most part, requires five key steps:\nKey Steps and Questions\n1. Measuring portfolio risk and ensuring capital adequacy\na. Loss distribution: How much capital is required to absorb possible portfolio losses?\nb. Stress testing: What are the expected losses and capital requirements under stress scenarios?\nc. Reverse stress testing: What scenarios, borrowers, sectors/regions contribute most to large\nlosses?\nd. Capital planning: What actions will be taken to maintain capital adequacy as stress scenarios\nunfold?\ne. Risk appetite: What are the target levels (risk appetite) and limits (risk tolerances) for risk-\ntaking?\n2. Quantifying each exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio risk\na. Risk Contribution: What is the increase in portfolio risk for a $1 increase in exposure value?\nb. Risk concentrations: Which borrowers, sectors, and regions impact portfolio risk the most?\n3. Setting limits to prevent excessive risk concentrations\na. Segment limits: What is the notional limit given a limit on each segment’s Risk Contribution?\nb. Borrower limits: What is the notional limit given a limit on borrower’s Risk Contribution?\n4. Increasing/reducing credit exposure to increase portfolio return/risk\na. Asset selection: Which exposures should be increased/decreased to increase portfolio\nreturn/risk?\nb. Asset selection and capital requirements: How should assets be selected given capital\nrequirements?\n5. Pricing and sizing new deals to increase portfolio return/risk\na. Risk-based pricing: What is the deal’s Risk Contribution and Sharpe Ratio, i.e., deal’s marginal\nimpact on portfolio return/risk, taking account of deal’s notional, standalone risk, and\ncorrelation with the portfolio?\nFinancial institutions can perform the five steps and their sub-steps and address questions listed above using\nRiskFrontier functionalities and outputs, as described next.\n6.1 Measuring Portfolio Risk and Ensuring Capital Adequacy\nLoss distribution: How much capital is required to absorb possible portfolio losses?\nRiskFrontier’s portfolio overview functionality outputs portfolio level risk metrics, including (i) loss quantile (aka Credit\nValue at Risk (CVaR) or Economic Capital (“EC”)), (ii) unexpected loss, i.e., standard deviation or volatility of portfolio\nlosses at a future horizon, and (iii) portfolio value and loss distributions — all of which inform and support an institution’s\ncapital adequacy assessment, capital planning and management, risk strategy, risk appetite, and risk tolerance, and are\nincreasingly being reported and communicated both internally and externally.\nStress testing: What are the expected losses and capital requirements under stress scenarios?\nRiskFrontier’s conditional distribution functionality uses a Monte Carlo simulation engine, together with the GCorr\nframework, to capture systematic factors’ (e.g. country and industry factors) and macroeconomic factors’ (e.g. GDP,\nunemployment rate, etc.) impacts on borrower credit quality and the resulting exposure and portfolio losses, and\nproduce outputs, including portfolio loss distribution, expected loss (EL), unexpected loss (UL), and economic capital (EC)\nconditional on user-specified stress scenarios. GCorr model coverage continues to expand and currently includes close to\n1,000 total factors, including about 250 national, regional, and international macroeconomic variables.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 18Reverse stress testing: What scenarios, borrowers, sectors/regions contribute most to large losses?\nIn RiskFrontier with GCorr Macro module, macroeconomic variables do not replace GCorr systematic credit risk factors\nduring simulation and in modeling portfolio risk, but are simulated in correlation and along with credit risk factors, thus\nfacilitating reverse stress testing. Specifically, RiskFrontier’s Monte Carlo simulation output file for an unconditional\nsimulation can be used to identify scenarios, factors, borrowers, sectors, or regions associated with any target level of\nportfolio loss.\nCapital planning: What actions will be taken to maintain capital adequacy as stress scenarios unfold?\nPreviously described loss distribution, stress testing, and reverse stress testing results from RiskFrontier can be used to:\n» Project capital demand and capital supply and assess capital adequacy under stress scenarios\n» Plan and determine management actions (e.g. capital increase or risk/exposure reduction) that will\nbe taken to prevent and to recover from possible capital deficiencies, if and as stress scenarios\nunfold\n» Use such capital planning as part of internal capital adequacy assessment process and discussion\nwith regulators, supervisors, and stakeholders\nRisk appetite: What are the target levels (risk appetite) and limits (risk tolerances) for risk-taking?\nPreviously described portfolio risk and capital adequacy assessment results and metrics from RiskFrontier can be used to\nestimate capital demand and supply and compare them with market opportunity and institution’s risk strategy to inform\nand determine:\n» Risk capacity, i.e., the maximum amount of risk an institution can support in pursuit of its business\nobjectives.\n» Risk appetite13, i.e., the target amount or range of risk an institution is willing to accept in pursuit of\nits business objectives; risk appetite is lower than risk capacity to allow for a safety margin.\n» Risk tolerance and risk limits, i.e., boundaries of risk-taking within which an institution is willing to\noperate; risk appetite is articulated more qualitatively and at aggregate level, while risk tolerances\nand limits are more quantitative and granular, e.g. borrower and segment limits.\n6.2 Quantifying Each Exposure’s Marginal Impact on Portfolio Risk\nRisk contribution: What is the increase in portfolio risk for a $1 increase in exposure value?\nExposure’s Risk Contribution (“RC”), defined as the increase in portfolio risk (i.e., standard deviation of portfolio value at\ni\nhorizon) for a $1 increase in exposure’s value, can be shown to equal the exposure’s standalone risk per unit exposure\nvalue, i.e., standard deviation of exposure value at horizon per unit exposure value (aka “unexpected loss” or “UL”),\ni\nmultiplied by the correlation between exposure value and portfolio value at horizon (“CORR ”).\ni,p\n∗\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖)=𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝐼𝐼 $1 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶 𝐼𝐼𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼 𝑣𝑣𝐼𝐼𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼=𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑝𝑝 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖\nRisk concentrations: Which borrowers, sectors, and regions impact portfolio risk the most?\nRiskFrontier calculates Risk Contribution, taking into account each exposure’s notional, standalone risk per unit exposure\nvalue (driven mostly by PD, LGD, and maturity), as well as correlation with other exposures in the portfolio, regardless of\nthe source of correlation or risk concentration, e.g. borrower, sector, or region, thus eliminating the need for any\nconcentration add-on (relative to an assumed benchmark for a supposedly well-diversified portfolio). While there is no\nconsensus on a definition of concentration, RiskFrontier’s Risk Contribution output can be used to identify risk\nconcentrations and exposures (or sectors) that could cause large losses to the portfolio, and decide where to add/reduce\nexposure to increase diversification and reduce risk concentration and portfolio risk.\n13 For more information, see “Quantifying Risk Appetite in Limit Setting” by Kaplin, Levy, Meng, and Pospisil (2015).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 196.3 Setting Segment or Borrower Limits to Prevent Excessive Risk Concentrations\nRiskFrontier’s portfolio-referent instrument-level marginal return/risk measures, calculated as expected return\ndivided by Risk Contribution (RC), can be used not only to increase portfolio return/risk via asset selection, as\ndescribed in the next section, but also to monitor instrument-level marginal return/risk and prevent excessive risk\nconcentrations by rejecting deals or reducing exposures that have high RC and low marginal return/risk and that\nwould decrease portfolio return/risk. Doing so requires reliable tools and metrics and unflinching discipline.\nAs a practical, conservative alternative and/or supplementary approach, and as a backstop to the aforementioned\nmarginal return/risk-based monitoring and limit setting, most institutions also calculate and enforce absolute\nnotional limits in order to prevent excessive risk concentrations and to keep risk levels consistent with risk appetite\nand risk strategy. Limits based on notional exposure are a good start, but they have significant limitations:\n» They do not account for borrower- or segment-specific risk.\n» They do not account for the impact of borrower’s or segment’s correlation and concentration\nrelative to the portfolio.\n» They are more qualitative and subjective, and thus prone to subjective bias, and not easily\ndefendable.\n» They involve a manual process and are difficult to update frequently.\n» They are not dynamic; they generally remain fixed despite changes to portfolio holdings and profile.\nRiskFrontier users can overcome these limitations by using a quantitative and risk-sensitive approach. Specifically,\nRiskFrontier’s limit setting utility uses analytic formulas, together with Monte Carlo simulation results, to calculate\nthe relationship (“Risk vs. Notional Curve”) between a borrower’s or segment’s “Notional Weight” and the\ncorresponding “Risk Contribution Weight” for varying levels of borrower’s or segment’s Notional Weight, assuming\nno change to the rest of portfolio. Risk Contribution Weight is defined as the borrower’s or segment’s (analysis\ndate) value-weighted Risk Contribution as a fraction of the sum of (analysis date) the value-weighted Risk\nContribution of all exposures in the portfolio. Given a set of user-specified sector or borrower Risk Contribution\nWeight limits and using the aforementioned Risk vs. Notional Curve, RiskFrontier limit setting utility calculates the\ncorresponding set of risk-adjusted notional limits for each segment or borrower, assuming no change to the rest of\nthe portfolio. Users can specify the sector Risk Contribution Weight limits to be the same or different across\nsegments.\n6.4 Increasing/Reducing Credit Exposure to Increase Portfolio Return/Risk\nAsset selection: Which exposures should be increased/decreased to increase portfolio return/risk?\nIt can be shown that an exposure’s (standalone) expected return equals that exposure’s marginal contribution to\nportfolio expected return, regardless of exposure notional and portfolio characteristics. Thus, an exposure’s Sharpe Ratio,\ndefined as “expected return / Risk Contribution,” is a marginal measure quantifying exposure’s marginal impact on\nportfolio return/risk and can be used to decide which exposures to increase/decrease in order to increase portfolio\nreturn/risk. Portfolio return/risk can be increased by increasing exposures with Sharpe Ratios higher than the portfolio\nSharpe Ratio and decreasing exposures with Sharpe Ratios lower than portfolio Sharpe Ratio.\nPortfolio Sharpe Ratio changes with the portfolio and can be used as a dynamic hurdle rate, without the need to compare\nexposure’s Sharpe Ratio with an exogenously imposed hurdle rate, which often is static and not portfolio-sensitive,\ndespite changes in the portfolio. Furthermore, using an exogenously imposed hurdle rate is superfluous (relative to using\nportfolio Sharpe Ratio as the hurdle rate) and may lead to asset selection that can actually decrease portfolio Sharpe\nRatio. RiskFrontier calculates and reports each exposure’s expected return and Sharpe Ratio, together with Risk\nContribution, correlation with portfolio, and other risk measures discussed previously, and which can be used to\nselectively increase/decrease exposures and increase portfolio return/risk.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 20Asset selection and capital requirements: How should assets be selected given capital requirements?\nIf the financial institution’s regulatory or economic capital requirements appear to constrain the aforesaid asset selection,\nthe institution can overcome such apparent constraints by reducing portfolio size by scaling down (decreasing) all current\nexposures in the portfolio, or by raising additional capital at market rates. In either case and to the extent there is no\ngain/loss relative to market price, the institution can continue to increase portfolio return/risk by rebalancing portfolio\nusing the previously marginal return/risk contributions, while simultaneously and independently meeting regulatory\nand/or economic capital requirements.\n6.5 Pricing and Sizing New Deals to Increase Portfolio Return/Risk\nRisk-based pricing: What is the deal’s Risk Contribution and Sharpe Ratio, i.e., deal’s impact on portfolio return/risk,\ntaking account of deal’s notional, standalone risk, and correlation with portfolio?\nThe prior section focused on how RiskFrontier outputs can be used to decide what to buy, sell, or hold to increase\nportfolio return/risk. What is equally important is to do so at the right price and with the correct size and terms. Sizing\nand structuring deals appropriately become even more important when the institution is a price-taker rather than a\nprice-setter. RiskFrontier’s Trade and DealAnalyzer modules enable institutions to quickly calculate return and risk\nmeasures for a new deal or a basket of new deals, considering the deal’s standalone risk (driven mostly by PD, LGD, and\nmaturity), as well as portfolio correlation and risk concentrations. Leveraging key metrics from the original portfolio\nanalysis, RiskFrontier can quickly (within seconds and at the point of origination) calculate marginal return and risk\nstatistics, including expected return (or credit earnings), Risk Contribution (RC), Sharpe Ratio, and incremental portfolio\neconomic capital for new deals. Alternately, given RC for a deal, one can calculate the pricing required to meet or exceed\nportfolio Sharpe Ratio or any user-specified hurdle rate. Users can also calculate return/risk measures by substituting\nRiskFrontier’s expected return (numerator) with a user-specified expected return, which should be a marginal measure, in\norder to remain consistent with Risk Contribution (denominator), which is marginal.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 21References\nBlack, Fischer, and Myron Scholes, “The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities.” Journal of Political Economy, Vol 81, No 3,\n637– 659, 1973.\nDwyer, Douglas and Shisheng Qu, “EDF 8.0 Model Enhancements.” Moody’s KMV White Paper, 2007.\nGibbon, John, “RiskFrontier and Basel II, Pillar 2.” Moody’s KMV Whitepaper, 2007.\nHuang, Jimmy, et al. “Modeling Credit Portfolios.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, 2015.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS AN OVERVIEW OF MODELING CREDIT PORTFOLIOS 22© 2021 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
