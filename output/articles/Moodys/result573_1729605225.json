However, in recent months, Moody’s Analytics has noted a significant shift in\nactivity from P&C insurers towards incorporating ESG-C into their decision-making processes. While P&C companies can benefit\nfrom the work done by life insurers in developing ESG-C metrics and frameworks for their investment operations (through\nadoption of best practices), a lot of work still needs to be done to understand how to incorporate ESG-C into underwriting\nactivities.\nThus far, strategies to incorporate ESG-C into underwriting have varied considerably between insurers. Some focused purely on\ncertain business lines and sectors (For example, excluding new coal power plant developments), others have looked to create\nbalanced scorecards to measure ESG-C risks. The scores are then used to guide risk selection and pricing as well as providing\nmechanisms for referral to underwriting committees for risks that fall outside of ESG-C tolerances.\nDue to these variations in strategy, insurers, particularly large European insurers, have sought to find common ground and\ncollaborate to send consistent messages to the marketplace. It has resulted in a number of partnerships and alliances, of which the\nmost visible is the UN-convened Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA). The NZIA brings together 24 of the world’s leading insurers\nand reinsurers to play their part in accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions economies. They are committing to individually\ntransition their underwriting portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum\ntemperature rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nAs strategies evolve and converge, best practice will too. Given the varying benchmarks and taxonomies for ESG-C, insurers have\nsought to align with international standards. Particularly when it comes to communicating with external stakeholders. The most\nfrequently referenced standards are the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many insurers, both life and P&C, have found\nthe SDGs useful in defining their targets and ambitions. Consequently, insurers have sought to acquire ESG-C data and metrics\nthat use the SDGs as reference points, allowing them to align with these standards.\nThinking beyond downside risks\nHistorically, insurers have focused their attention on the downside risks associated with ESG-C, in particular risks related to\nreputational, and regulatory concerns. In addition, there has been a focus on transition risk2 in recent months, driven by increased\nenvironmental regulation, including carbon taxes, incentives for sustainable activities, technological, and consumer demand\nchanges. Such measures to support the transition to a low carbon economy, could potentially create loss of premium revenue for\nthose insurers who continue to focus on these sectors and don’t adapt their products for a carbon-efficient economy. In\nparticular, those carriers who maintain large underwriting exposures to hydrocarbon industries will find fewer opportunities as the\neconomy pivots to greener energy sources.\nThe focus has shifted from looking at ESG-C purely from a downside/defensive point of view to a forward looking, revenue\ngenerating point of view. Many P&C insurers, particularly those involved in corporate specialty P&C insurance are becoming more\nvocal of the revenue opportunities that ESG-C brings to the marketplace. Green infrastructure and renewable energy projects which\nsupport the transition from a high carbon to low-carbon economy should present new risks and premium opportunities for P&C\ninsurers. As such, those insurers who are better able to adapt their business models for these new risks are most likely to capture\nthese growth opportunities. This requires obtaining data on transition risks for sectors and insurers, and then deploying capacity and\nexpertise into sectors that are likely to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nDeveloping an ‘own view’ of ESG-C risk\nIncorporating ESG-C into underwriting requires insurers to redefine their underwriting risk appetites. Insurers are accustomed to\nchanging their risk appetites based on pricing dynamics, capital requirements, and growth targets. Incorporating ESG-C into\nunderwriting decisions will provide another lens to view risk selection and appetite. At the same time, insurers should ensure that\nthere are, at least initially, no ‘red lines’. Instead a balanced approach should be developed, that considers ESG-C holistically. For\nexample, it may seem convenient to cease coverage for coal-powered energy producers, who would score poorly on the ”E” part\nof ESG-C. However, these insureds may provide electricity to communities in developing countries. Leaving such assets\nunprotected would be damaging to communities who rely on these assets.\n2 Transition risks are business-related risks that follow societal and economic shifts toward a low-carbon and more climate-friendly\nfuture.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITING BX10625In addition, whilst ESG-C scores and metrics can provide a view of an insured’s position at a point of time, this would often ignore\nforward looking measures. Many companies might not have strong ESG-C scores today, but senior management would have plans\nto transition their companies to more sustainable business models. Drawing ‘red lines’ based purely on today’s ESG-C metrics of\nan insured may inhibit the insureds ability to execute its own transition plan. Insurers would be abdicating their responsibilities as\nrisk partners and advisors should they take a simple go/no go approach that doesn’t engage meaningfully in transition. It is\nessential that insurers collect and incorporate appropriate forward-looking data into their ESG-C score cards, and engage with\ntheir insureds to understand their future plans.\nHowever, in order to appropriately re-define risk appetites, it is also critical that insurers develop their own view of ESG-C, that is\nconsistent with other business functions at the company such as, investments, risk, operations, and also consistent with the ethos\nof the company and its objectives. Some insurers have sought to buy vendor-developed ESG scores, others have sought to\npurchase vendor-gathered raw ESG-C metrics to incorporate into their own balanced scorecards, that better reflect their own\nview of ESG-C risk. It also allows companies to take ownership and accountability of the decisions they take based on the\nbalanced scorecards. Furthermore, it aligns with one of the key principles of the NZIA, namely independently setting their\nunderwriting criteria with regards to emissions and ESG.\nChallenges\nInsurers have been more successful at measuring ESG-C risk for their investment portfolios than underwriting operations. One\nreason is, the better quality of data to identify the correct counterparty in investment portfolios relative to underwriting\nportfolios. P&C insurers, particularly those with significant corporate specialty operations, have poor data on the actual names of\ntheir insureds. Additionally, ESG-C scores and metrics are provided at a group level, rather than subsidiary level. Consequently,\ninsurers struggle to match ESG-C scores to insureds. Obtaining good quality and consistent corporate entity information is key in\nensuring not appropriate ESG-C scores are obtained, and accurate heatmaps are generated.\nFurthermore, the investment portfolios of insurers tend to be focused around well rated, public corporates and sovereigns, for\nwhich ESG-C scores are readily available. Conversely, insurance portfolios of P&C insurers are mostly focused on non-public\nentities and, in the case of retail insurers, on private individuals. ESG-C scores for private entities are not as readily available as\nthey are for public companies. To ensure a level of completeness for understanding the ESG-C exposure of an underwriting\nportfolio, insurers must obtain ESG-C data on private companies as well as public.\nThere is likely to be considerable resistance to change, particularly from those underwriters who’s lines of business benefit from\nhydrocarbon extraction and refining. Underwriters for these lines of business may see ESG-C risk assessment as a threat to their\ndivisions as well as their own careers within the insurance market. Additionally, other underwriters may feel concerned that they\nmay have to stop providing coverage to long-standing clients. To counter this, it is again essential to underscore the importance of\nengagement with insureds, rather than ‘walking away’.\nConclusion\nIncorporating ESG-C into underwriting is part of the larger challenge of incorporating ESG-C across an insurance company’s\ninvestments, risk management and supplier management operations. It is critical to develop consistency in the metrics and\ntolerances used across the business to assess and understand ESG-C risk. Failure to do this could result in siloed decisions being\nmade in different functions that are inconsistent with each other.\nAs P&C insurers continue their ESG-C initiatives, the door is open to build competitive advantages by imposing their own view of\nESG-C risks, redefining risk appetites, incorporating it into the decision-making process, and critically engaging with insureds. It\nwill, however, require insurers to fully appreciate that ESG-C does not only represent a threat, but a growth opportunity. The right\ndata, particularly on private companies, is required to make consistent decisions across different underwriting lines of business.\nThis is part of a series of papers on climate risk topics for insurers.
