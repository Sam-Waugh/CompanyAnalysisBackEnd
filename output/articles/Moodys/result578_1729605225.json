Basic\nfacts such as the climate sensitivity (how much warming we will see for a doubling of\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere), and economic sensitivity (how much damage we see\ngiven a level of warming) are both uncertain within a wide range. Technology costs and fiscal\nresponses to climate shocks and carbon prices can further impact the overall results. While\nthe NGFS scenarios may appear to have only a limited number of narratives, the total\nuniverse of possible outcomes is much larger when each of these assumptions is considered.\nAnalyzing just one or two scenarios will not be enough to grasp the sensitivity to these\nunderlying assumptions, and to assess the full range of plausible outcomes.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CONSTRU CTING CLIMATE PATHWAY SCENARIOS TO ASSESS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE RISK 1Setting Transparent Macroeconomic Assumptions\nThe first step in expanding a climate scenario is to consider the macroeconomic impacts. Macroeconomic modeling of climate\nchange often concentrates principally on the impact on GDP, but this focus can obscure the real magnitude of the costs1. Acute\nphysical risks like flooding or storm damage can produce significant damages, but reconstruction provides a rebound boost to\nGDP. Similarly, investments in new transport stock or retrofitting buildings will show as a contribution to overall output. In both\ncases, however, these are more correctly viewed as opportunity costs, reducing investment available elsewhere or consumption.\nTo reflect the climate risks in financial markets, we calculate the total impact of these opportunity costs on consumption within a\ngiven region. These costs can be classified as adaption costs/physical damages (caused by or in response to physical risks),\nabatement costs (spending on decarbonization), and allowance costs (carbon taxes, permits, or prices). This “three A” approach to\naccounting for climate costs aims to quantify the primary impact on economic activity of different climate pathways.\nIn the phase 2 release the NGFS have expanded the range of macroeconomic modeling they provide. Partnering with the National\nInstitute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) and using their econometric model NiGEM to produce a range of expanded\nmacro and financial variables. A key assumption in the NiGEM results is the choice of fiscal response. As the NGFS phase two\ndocumentation attests, whether carbon tax revenues are used to pay down debt, to offset taxes elsewhere, or are directly\nreinvested by governments, can even change whether a given scenario is positive or negative for overall output. Given how\nimportant the choice of response, and the implicit assumptions about fiscal multipliers are, it is unfortunate that the NGFS\nscenarios do not offer a range of NiGEM outcomes, making it hard to disentangle the effects of the climate shocks from the fiscal\nresponse and to analyze the sensitivity to these assumptions.\nIn addition to the fiscal rules applied to a given scenario, the technology costs, and availability of different technologies are also\ncritical inputs. The NGFS runs three different integrated assessment models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, GCAM, and MESSAGE-\nGLOBIOM. These models differ on a range of modeling inputs, from regional granularity, to land use policies, the potential for\ncarbon capture and storage (CCS), energy system capital costs and their optimization methods. As a result, the energy mix can\nvary significantly between models, for the same narrative, as can the carbon price, and hence the abatement costs. For example,\ncarbon prices in the Below 2C scenario reach a level of $420 per ton of CO2 to achieve net zero in the REMIND-MaGPIE model,\nbut surpass $850 per ton in GCAM for the same target.\nComparing results across IAMs can help to examine the impact of these variations on overall transition costs and financial returns.\nIn future releases, there will hopefully be a greater range of scenarios focused on different technology pathways: For example\nscenarios without any significant CCS, or with a more substantial role for hydrogen could produce different results than the\ncurrent narratives.\nThe High-Level View\nGiven the range of uncertainties and layers of modeling used in climate risk analysis it is important to take time to understand the\nscenarios and the materiality of each assumption before diving too deeply into detailed modeling of the results.\nTraditionally, investors have managed their exposure to risk through allocations at the asset class level, and it is a good place to\nstart with climate risk as well. Shocks to consumption can be formally linked to interest rates and to risk premia through a\ncombination of the Ramsey rule and the consumption capital asset pricing model. These shocks will cascade into individual asset\nclasses, providing specific impacts to returns on each class; these impacts will vary across classes and geographic regions.\n1 Focusing on growth in economic output is often critiqued by environmentalists and economists on the basis that many of the economic costs associated with\nclimate change are non-monetary. Further, they argue that focusing on output as a measure of welfare is overly narrow, and that perpetual growth in output\ncannot be sustainable given finite resources. Our critique is more narrowly applied to the monetary impacts, focusing just on growth in output misses\nimportant opportunity costs and investment requirements arising from climate change.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CONSTRUCTING CLIMATE PATHWAY SCENARIOS TO ASSESS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE RISK 2In addition to the impacts from changes to consumption, another channel which can provide a more immediate effect, is inflation.\nEnergy prices increase significantly in transition scenarios, in some cases more than doubling, as carbon prices are passed through\nto consumers. Energy prices are a direct component of inflation, but also produce secondary effects as higher energy prices are\nthemselves passed along the production chain. While impacts on consumption from abatement spending, or physical damages\ncan take time to accumulate, inflationary effects are often immediate. The drag on consumption, lowering real returns, while\nenergy inflation rises, can create a wedge between nominal and real returns, causing them to move in different directions.\nDrilling Down to Individual Sectors\nAfter we have understood the impact of our climate pathways at the asset class level, and determined which scenarios will be of\nmost concern, the next step is to consider how to respond. At this stage, it’s natural to drill down into individual sectors. Even in a\ntransition scenario which looks relatively benign at the macro level, there will be winners and losers in different industries.\nThere are four principal channels through which sector costs are impacted in a climate transition scenario:\n» Demand: Changes in the structure of the economy can alter demand across sectors. Cost pass-through can also impact\noverall demand depending on the level of elasticity in different markets. Input-output tables and national accounts of value\nadded by sector can provide a starting point for demand.\n» Energy Costs: Final energy demand and energy prices are a crucial output from Integrated Assessment Models. Energy costs\ncan increase significantly in early years of a transition scenario.\n» Carbon Taxes: Carbon taxes are the key driver of policy effects within climate models. Carbon taxes here represent the total\ndirect costs of emitting carbon, and in practice could be implemented as tradeable permits, direct taxes, or regulations such as\nemissions standards which imply a shadow price. Tax rates can vary by sector and region, reflecting the degree of coordination\nand how orderly a transition is.\n» Investment: Significant investment will be required to restructure the economy in a transition scenario. In some sectors\ninvestment may be needed just to maintain current demand. As at the whole economy level for each sector and firm there\nwill be trade-offs between paying direct taxes, or higher energy costs and making investments to reduce emissions.\nUnderstanding all of these channels, and their interactions, is essential to provide an accurate assessment of transition costs. Some\nsectors, such as electricity supply, may currently have high emissions, and hence expect to pay large direct taxes, but they may\nalso be able to decarbonize more easily than other sectors. Renewables are likely to experience significant growth in demand, but\nthis growth does not come for free: debt will have to be raised, or earnings retained, to provide investment in new capital stock.\nTo maximize value, management and investors need to consider both the expected growth (or fall) in earnings for a given sectors,\nalongside the costs of capital.\nThe rate of reinvestment should depend on expected growth, and whether the return on invested capital (ROIC) is higher or lower\nthan the weighted cost of capital (WACC). Growth adds value for existing owners when ROIC > WACC, but when costs of capital\nare greater than returns it may make more sense to carefully run down a business and return cash to owners. In a scenario where\nfirms attempt to continue investment beyond the point where they can generate sufficient returns, they could end up with\nstranded assets which ultimately have to be written off.\nMaking Sense of NGFS Scenarios\nIncorporating climate risk into business planning, risk management, and investment decisions poses a significant challenge for\ninsurers and pension firms, but one which is of increasing importance for both internal and regulatory purposes. Scenario analysis\nbuilt on the NGFS projections can be an invaluable tool in this process, but care must be taken to understand the range of\nunderlying risks and uncertainties.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS CONSTRUCTING CLIMATE PATHWAY SCENARIOS TO ASSESS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE RISK 3This is part of a series of papers on climate risk topics for insurers.
