Insurers\nwith participating business will need to place a market-consistent value on the options and\nguarantees, most likely using a scenario generator. For most insurers, this is not a new concept.\nHowever, for some insurers, particularly outside of Europe and North America, this will be\na new requirement. Regardless of whether an insurer is implementing a scenario generator\nfor the first time or is an established user, insurers should review their choice of models and\ncalibrations in their scenario generator and validate that they are appropriate for IFRS 17.\nThere are multiple challenges insurers must address for market-consistent valuation across all\nlines of business:\n» The assessment whether there is a need for a scenario generator within the IFRS 17 valuation.\n» The development of a methodology for setting the discount curve and a process to produce\nthe yield curve at each valuation date.\n» The choice of stressed yield curves and stressed scenario sets if needed for disclosures.\nImplementing a scenario generator\nInsurers implementing market-consistent valuation for the first time must assess if a scenario\ngenerator is required. The valuation of participating business, which has options and guarantees,\nmay require the use of stochastic methods. Although the IFRS 17 standard does mention\nthat replicating portfolios can be used to determine the fair value of selected cash flows, it is\nunlikely that such assets are readily found. Therefore, a scenario generator is usually adopted\nfor this purpose. The most common stochastic modeling technique applied is based on thetechnique of risk-neutral pricing. Risk-neutral methods have been widely applied in both the\nbanking and insurance industry to price contingent claims. A scenario generator is calibrated to\nobservable market prices and then used to simulate risk neutral scenarios. (See the appendix for\nan overview of risk neutral pricing.) The scenarios are fed into the insurer’s cash flow projection\nmodel and Monte Carlo valuation is then applied to value the insurance liability.\nModel selection\nWhen implementing a scenario generator, the user must first select the appropriate model for\neach asset class, and consider the nature of their liabilities and desired level of sophistication.\nMore complex models are better able to capture market dynamics (for example, skewness\nin option markets) and dependencies across risk factors. Models should be arbitrage-free\nand produce prices consistent with markets. Quantitative expertise is required to design\nand calibrate the models in the scenario generator. Since the launch of the first version of\nMoody’s Analytics Scenario Generator in 2002, we have continually refined the models to\nincorporate new features, reflect developments in financial markets, and meet the evolving\ndemands of the insurance sector. Taking interest rate modeling as an example, there have\nbeen several notable advances over the past 20 years (Figure 1), including the enhancement\nof the models to achieve a more accurate fit to the full swaption surface and their adaptation\nfor the negative rate environment.\nFigure 1: Developments in Interest Rate Models\nModel calibration\nTo achieve the objective of market-consistent valuation of the options and guarantees\nwithin insurance liabilities, the scenario generator must be calibrated to the observed price\nof relevant market instruments. This means parameterizing the models such that when the\nsimulated scenarios are used to value financial instruments, the resulting value aligns with\nmarket prices.\nThe first task in model calibration is sourcing the relevant data and, where there is insufficient\ndata, developing a justifiable and documented approach to setting assumptions. IFRS 17\ndoes not give explicit instruction but does state that an entity should maximize the use of\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS | SCENARIO MODELING FOR IFRS 17 - ECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND YIELD CURVES 2observable market inputs. A common challenge when calibrating the models is that the term\nof the liabilities often extends beyond the availability of market instruments. For example, an\ninsurance contract may contain long-term minimum interest rate guarantees, with the term\nof the liability exceeding the maturity of the swaptions and/or equity options available in the\nmarket. An approach must be developed to extrapolate beyond the observable market data,\nwhich inevitably involves expert judgment.\nAutomation\nNaturally, insurers should aim to calibrate models and generate scenarios based on an\nefficient process that uses technology such as cloud computing to minimize run times when\nthe reporting window is compressed. Calibration and production should be performed in an\nautomated framework with limited manual intervention to reduce operational risk and key\nman dependency. The calibration process should be tested for stability of calibrations and its\nability to cope with extreme market movements.\nDefining the discount curve\nThe discount curve is a key element of IFRS 17. Calculating the fulfillment cash flows under\nIFRS 17 requires insurers to discount their cash flows to reflect the time value of money and\nthe financial risks related to those cash flows. Discount rates also feature in the calculation\nof the contractual service margin. Thus, the choice of curve will have a direct impact on the\nliabilities established at contract recognition and the timing of subsequent profit.\nAnother consideration is that the standard is principles-based rather than prescribed. As a\nresult, it is up to insurers to define a suitable methodology for the discount curve that aligns\nwith these principles. In Europe, this presents a marked difference from the regulatory regime,\nSolvency II, where the reference curve is prescribed and published by the European Insurance\nand Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).\nIFRS 17 allows two different approaches for yield curve construction and discounting which,\nin theory, but not necessarily in practice, produce equivalent results. The two approaches\nare known as the top-down and bottom-up approach. However, defining the discount curve\nmethodology involves more than selecting between top-down and bottom-up. IFRS 17\nintroduces the requirement for insurers to use a discount rate that is consistent with market\nprices and reflects the characteristics of their liabilities, particularly the cash flow, and\nliquidity characteristics. The first requirement—to reflect market prices—will be familiar to\nany European insurer, as it is necessary for regulatory reporting under Solvency II. However,\nthis still presents challenges in terms of what instruments to use and the availability of\nappropriate market data. To satisfy the second requirement—to reflect the characteristics of\nliabilities—a two-step approach may be adopted in practice:\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS | SCENARIO MODELING FOR IFRS 17 - ECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND YIELD CURVES 3» First, assess and quantify the degree of liability illiquidity in a contract or group of contracts,\nbased on an analysis of the surrender characteristics of the contracts. The output may be\nreminiscent of the Solvency II QIS5 bucketing approach, which proposed a sliding scale whereby\nonly the most illiquid contracts qualified for 100% of the illiquidity premium. There are multiple\nchallenges insurers must address for market-consistent valuation across all lines of business:\n» Second, calibrate the illiquidity premia to a market estimate of liquidity premia. There are\nvarious methods for deriving an illiquidity premium estimate. One approach, adopted by\nMoody’s Analytics, is to apply a structural model to estimate the fair value spread that\naccounts for the credit risk, and then attribute the excess of the market spread over the fair\nvalue spread to illiquidity premium (Figure 2). This approach uses Moody’s Analytics EDF™\n(Expected Default Frequency) software and the CreditEdge™ tool that financial institutions\nuse to estimate the expected credit loss under IFRS 9.\nFigure 2: Decomposition of historical credit spreads for USD corporate bonds\nHere are other challenges in deriving the discount curve:\n» Insurers must decide whether it is justifiable to derive the discount rate from their actual\nasset portfolio or whether to use a reference portfolio. European insurers (primarily in the\nUnited Kingdom and Spain) who currently apply the matching adjustment are familiar with\napplying a discount rate that is directly linked to the (risk-adjusted) yield on the backing\nassets. IFRS 17 does not refer to actual assets held except for the measurement of contracts\nwhere the features are linked to the performance of a pool of underlying assets. Indeed, as\nemphasized previously, the standard states that the discount rate should be determined with\nreference to the characteristics of the liabilities. Therefore, a reference portfolio could be used\nto match those characteristics.\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS | SCENARIO MODELING FOR IFRS 17 - ECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND YIELD CURVES 4» Insurers will need to extrapolate the discount curve beyond the market data. This was a\nkey topic for Solvency II, where Smith Wilson was chosen as the extrapolation method and\nEIOPA specified a last liquid point (LLP) and ultimate forward rate (UFR). IFRS 17 is principles-\nbased, so insurers have more flexibility to choose an extrapolation method. Smith Wilson is\none option, but there are others such as Nelson Siegel. Moody’s Analytics enables clients to\ncustomize the extrapolation of the curve using their calibration tools.\nSensitivities\nIFRS 17 requires the entity to disclose information that enables a clear understanding of the\nentity’s exposure to market risk, including a sensitivity analysis that shows how profit or loss\nis affected by changes in risk exposure. Insurers must assess the implications of changes in risk\nexposure for stress scenario production. Also, they must determine appropriate stresses to apply\nto each market risk, produce the relevant output (for example, stressed discount curve) and, where\napplicable, produce market-consistent scenarios to value their liabilities under the sensitivity.\nThere will likely be a further requirement to produce historical discount curves to support the\ncalculation of the contractual service margin (CSM) if entities choose to look back to the date\nof initial recognition to determine the discount rate and calculate the CSM. These historical\ndiscount curves would then also be used to accrete interest on the CSM in future years.\nConclusion\nIFRS 17 is principles-based; thus, there are many methodology decisions that insurers will have\nto make. This paper outlined the challenges related to deriving the liability discount curve and\nimplementing a scenario generator. Moody’s Analytics is at the forefront of yield curve and\nscenario modeling for insurers. Moody’s Analytics Scenario Generator helps insurers meet\nthe requirements of the new accounting regime.

Bonds, currencies, and equity shares are fundamental\nassets - ‘underlying’ direct claims on capital. Derivatives (such as forward contracts and\noptions) are indirect financial claims which are contingent on the behavior of the underlying\nasset. The understanding of financial economists is that – subject to some important\nassumptions – the value of a contingent claim depends only on what is possible for future\nasset prices rather than the specific set of probabilities assigned to possible events. The\nreal probability of an event does not enter into the pricing calculation. The pricing methods\ndeveloped also reveal replicating portfolios for contingent claims – portfolios which (if\nnecessary, adjusted over time) exactly match the payoffs from a derivative.\nThis surprising analysis tells us that, so long as we work with a set of probabilities that are\nconsistent with market prices and possible outcomes, any set of probabilities could be used\nfor pricing contingent claims.\nHowever, for a given set of probabilities, a special set of discount rates must be used to\ncorrectly value contingent claims. Generally, these discount rates are difficult to calculate,\nsince they are state-specific. However, it turns out that there is one set of probabilities that\nis much easier to work with than any other. The best set of probabilities to work with is the\n‘risk-neutral’ set of probabilities, so-called because they are consistent with asset prices and\npossibilities in a world in which investors are neutral towards risk, and therefore demand the\nsame risk-free return from all assets. If we choose to work with risk-neutral probabilities,\nit is possible to discount all expected payoffs at the risk-free rate, which simplifies the\nimplementation of pricing calculations enormously. One should note that risk-neutral pricing\ngives no information on real-world expected returns (except that they are not required for\npricing contingent claims). It is a clever computational short-cut for valuation calculations.\nThe technique also brings understanding into the drivers of contingent claims valuation.\nIt will be no surprise that the assumptions used to develop risk-neutral models (like any\nmodel) do not hold in the real world. In practice, prices do deviate from their model-predicted\nvalues. In applying option pricing models, practitioners recognize this and frequently choose\nto modify the inputs to the model rather than build more complex models under a more\ngeneral set of assumptions.\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS | SCENARIO MODELING FOR IFRS 17 - ECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND YIELD CURVES 7CONTACT US\nFind out more information about Moody’s Analytics\naward winning solutions for IFRS 17.\nwww.moodysanalytics.com/IFRS17\nCONTACT DETAILS\nVisit us at moodysanalytics.com or contact us at a location below.\nAMERICAS EMEA ASIA (EXCLUDING JAPAN) JAPAN\n+1.212.553.1653 +44.20.7772.5454 +852.3551.3077 +81.3.5408.4100\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com clientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\n© 2020 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
