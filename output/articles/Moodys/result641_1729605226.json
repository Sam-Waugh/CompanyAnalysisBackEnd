Required in more than 100 countries, all financial entities\nmust incorporate a new expected credit loss model and adhere to new accounting standards within\nContributor\nthe next few years. Some institutions might face challenges to implement improvements, including\nYanping Pan,\nincorporation of a logical model for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, and\nDirector-Research\nincorporating a forward-looking expected credit loss impairment model. The new accounting standards\nContact Us aim to simplify and strengthen risk measurement and the reporting of financial instruments in an\nAmericas +1.212.553.1653 efficient and forward-looking manner. They also have far-reaching impacts on global institutions’\nEurope +44.20.7772.5454 accounting practices and performance results, with a shift in how both the risk and finance departments\nwork together.\nAsia-Pacific +852.3551.3077\nJapan +81.3.5408.4100\nTo address the “too little, too late” problem arising from the incurred loss model, the new accounting\nstandards evoke a “forward-looking” impairment model. This forward-looking approach requires firms\nto update and recognize expected credit loss (ECL) for financial assets from the initial acquisition\nor origination date. It is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before impairment\nlosses are recognized. Expected credit loss provides an estimate of the losses based on credit risk of\nthe borrower and can be calculated using various methods. One of the approaches defines the ECL\nas a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses, or the present value of all cash shortfalls, over the\nexpected life of the financial instrument. A cash shortfall is the difference between cash flows as stated\nin the contract, and expected cash flows, which incorporate the probability of default. ECL estimation\nis required to consider the time value of money. Most importantly, the estimation must rely upon\nthe reasonable and supportable information available, including historical, current, and forecasted\ninformation.\nThis paper focuses specifically on the impairment model for the new accounting standards. We discuss\nthe new requirements for measuring the expected loss impairment of financial assets, highlight\nchallenges faced by institutions in interpreting the impairment guidance, and offer advice on how to\nmeet data and modeling requirements for adhering to the impairment standards.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nCONTENTS\nABSTRACT ..........................................................................................................................................................1\nREGULATION OVERVIEW - MEASUREMENT OF LOSS ALLOWANCE ......................................................3\nCOMPARISON OF BASEL EXPECTED LOSS MODELS AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ..........4\nA FORWARD-LOOKING IMPAIRMENT MODEL ...........................................................................................4\nCONCLUSION ...................................................................................................................................................8\nREFERENCES .....................................................................................................................................................9\n2 MARCH 2017 FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE ON IMPAIRMENTS USING EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nRegulation Overview - Measurement of Loss Allowance\nOVERVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) 9\nIFRS 9 requires firms to recognize loss allowance for expected credit losses at each reporting date, and\nto update the amount of expected credit loss recognized to reflect changes in the credit risk of financial\ninstruments in scope. This new approach represents a significant change from the International Accounting\nStandard (IAS) 39 incurred loss models, as impairment loss allowance will be recognized for all loans without\nthe “object of impairment evidence.”\nIFRS 9 provides three approaches for recognizing financial asset impairment:\n» A “three-bucket” approach for regular financial instruments\n» A simplified approach for lease receivables, trade receivables, and contract assets without a significant\nfinancing component\n» A special, “credit-adjusted EIR” method for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial instruments\nUnder the “three-bucket” approach, 12-month expected credit losses are recognized as the loss allowance\nfor all relevant financial instruments which are originated or newly acquired. In future reporting periods,\nthis approach requires assessing credit deterioration of the financial instrument by comparing the credit\nrisk of the financial instrument at the reporting date with the credit risk at the date of initial recognition. To\nperform this assessment, entities must use the change in lifetime default risk, considering quantitative and/\nor qualitative information. If there has been a significant increase in the credit risk of a financial instrument,\nlifetime expected credit losses would then be recognized.\nINTRODUCTION TO CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS (CECL)\nIn June 2016, FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) for a current expected credit loss (CECL)\nmodel covering recognition and measurement of credit losses for financial assets. The CECL model applies to\nall entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases.\nThe new accounting standards focus on improving the measurement and reporting of credit losses, and\nmoving to the measurement of expected credit losses over a financial instrument’s lifetime. Unlike the\nIFRS 9 credit loss model, the CECL model does not determine credit deterioration of the instrument for the\nrecognition of an impairment allowance.\nCECL model requirements consider information regarding:\n» Past events, including historical experience\n» Current conditions\n» Reasonable and supportable forecasts\n» Life of loan or life of portfolio loss experience\n» Forecast of future economic conditions and different loans might differ over time based on an institution’s\nforecast of economic conditions\nWhile both IFRS 9 and CECL guidance does not directly prescribe any specific method for calculating\nexpected credit loss, the guidance states the ECL model must use reasonable and supportable forecasts for\nestimating expected credit losses.\nFinancial institutions must consider a more robust and sophisticated “expected loss approach” for most\nportfolios. The expected loss approach breaks the total loss amount modeling into four parts: probability\n3 MARCH 2017 FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE ON IMPAIRMENTS USING EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nof default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD), and expected life estimation (for\nthe lifetime expected credit loss calculation). Many institutions are considering relying on their existing\ninternal credit risk management systems and expected loss calculation processes used for Basel regulatory\nrequirements, but must modify them to comply with the new accounting standards. These modifications\ninclude adjustments to Through-the-Cycle vs. Point-in-Time PD estimates and extending the Basel one-\nyear PD, LGD, and EAD term structures to capture the entire lifetime of the financial instruments. Other\ninstitutions might use in-house models and processes for stress testing, and adjust the forecast for the\nforward-looking scenario rather than stressed scenarios. Estimating “forward-looking,” future economic\nconditions is only the first step of the adjustment process; institutions must develop single or multiple\neconomic scenarios to calculate expected credit loss.\nComparison of Basel Expected Loss Models and New Accounting Standards\nThe new impairment accounting treatment has increased convergence between accounting, regulatory\nstandards, and credit risk management practices. When managing regulatory capital standards, the primary\ninput parameters for identifying credit risk are PD, LGD, and EAD models. By making significant adjustments\nto Basel PD and LGD, these factors can be used in impairment modeling.\nThe following risk parameters require adjustment under the IFRS 9 guidelines:\nFactors Requiring Adjustment Basel Framework New Impairment Requirements\nProbability of default Through-the-cycle Point-in-time based on macroeconomic cycle\nLoss given default Downturn LGD Point-in-time based on macroeconomic cycle\nOne year PD Lifetime PD estimate with extended term\nTime horizon\nstructure\n- 30-days past due rebuttal assumption for Stage\nDays past due\n2 classification\nThe impairment estimation requires models that incorporate current macroeconomic information and\nforward-looking parameters. Financial institutions are required to develop or enhance their current set of\nrisk-rating models with sufficient granularity to meet audit and regulatory requirements. Additionally, they\nmust demonstrate forecasting capabilities beyond two to three years to be used for calculation of lifetime\nlosses. Unreliable forecasts will result in higher volatility of provisions. Increased expected losses due to\nthe calculation of lifetime losses can place a strain on earnings, resulting in an impact to capital. The new\nstandards of impairment accounting would adversely affect Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio,\ncapital planning, and regulatory capital.\nA Forward-Looking Impairment Model\nDuring the financial crisis, the delayed recognition of credit losses on loans and financial instruments was\nidentified as a weakness in existing accounting standards. The existing incurred loss model recognizes a credit\nloss in the profit and loss (P&L) account. This approach to recognize losses after they have been incurred on\na financial asset has been criticized for being ‘too little, too late.’ The main objective of the new impairment\nmodel is to provide a better understanding of an entity’s expected credit losses on financial assets. The\nexpected loss of a financial asset is estimated as the present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the\nexpected life of the asset, and is recognized in the P&L statement. The new impairment model is expected to\nbe implemented for all financial assets, including newly acquired assets.\n4 MARCH 2017 FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE ON IMPAIRMENTS USING EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nInstitutions must model different segments of their portfolio and apply estimation techniques consistent\nwith the accounting standards. For example, modeling revolving credit loans with prepayments requires\nmodeling additional parameters. The modeling framework requires a consistent approach of applying\nimpairment analysis and forecasting across the entire portfolio.\nLifetime ECL is defined as a “credit loss” estimate of the present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected\nlife of the financial instrument. The cash shortfall is the difference between the present value of the cash\nflows due to an entity, in accordance with the contract, and the present value of the cash flows that the\nentity expects to receive. Lifetime expected credit losses result from all possible default events over the\nexpected life of a financial instrument. The “one-year expected credit loss” is the portion of lifetime ECL that\nresults from default events within the year following the reporting date. Hence, the estimate must reflect\nan unbiased and probability-weighted number of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible\noutcomes. This method follows best practices based on IFRS 9 ECL modeling, and satisfies the criteria for a\nCECL-compliant impairment model.\nThe following summarizes the opinions of the IFRS Transition Resource Group for Impairment of Financial\nInstruments (ITG) on the implementation of the IFRS 9 impairment model:\n“To measure expected credit loss, using a single scenario is not sufficient (even the most likely one), one\nmust consider multiple scenarios. The probability of default (PD) and credit loss for a range of different\nforward-looking scenarios is non-linear. The expected credit losses derived from using a single scenario\nare not the same as the expected credit losses determined by a range of different, forward-looking\nscenarios.\nTo determine significant increase in credit risk (when considering economic scenarios), the PD for each\nscenario is calculated and weighted by the likelihood of that scenario occurring. To assess whether there\nhas been a significant increase in credit risk for the portfolio, the weighted PD is compared to the PD at\ninitial recognition (similarly probability-weighted if relevant).\nAlso to consider, a single, weighted scenario can underestimate the expected credit loss due to the non-\nlinear nature of credit losses.”\nIFRS 9 standards (Transition Resource Group for Impairment of Financial Instruments, Dec 2015).\nFor impairment models, there is a need for robust modeling methodology using an institution’s internal\ndata or benchmark data or both. It requires data aggregation for modeling and leveraging existing risk-rating\nmodels (for example, stress testing models). There is also a need to have a framework to apply qualitative\noverlay adjustments.\nThe following details two of the techniques used to address the modeling-related challenges for the\nimpairment module.\n5 MARCH 2017 FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE ON IMPAIRMENTS USING EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n1.

However, the rating must be adjusted to reflect a point-in-time\nPD term structure to represent the current macroeconomic conditions. A borrower moves up or down in\nrating grades through the economic cycle. Point-in-time PD models incorporate information from a current\ncredit cycle and assess risk at a point-in-time. The point-in-time PD term structure can be used to measure\ncredit deterioration and starting PD when performing the allowance calculations. Also, when calculating\nlifetime expected credit losses, the point-in-time PD term structure must be extrapolated through the loan’s\nmaturity. After the inputs are correctly converted, you can project the cash flows and calculate the gross\ncarrying amount, loss allowance, and amortized cost for the financial instrument.\n2. INCORPORATE SCENARIO-BASED ANALYSIS\ntluafeD\nfo\nytilibaborP\nScenarios\nW\n1\nW\n2\n......\nW\nn\nYear T=Maturity\nMacroeconomic Scenario-based Expected Credit Loss (ECL) analysis\nIncluding macroeconomic scenario-based analysis gives a forward-looking view due to its range of possible\nscenarios. The purpose of estimating expected credit losses is not to estimate a worst-case or best-case\nscenario, but to estimate the possibility that a credit loss occurs with the realization of the most likely\nscenario. Understanding the risk or probability of a credit loss when incorporating the possibility that a\nscenario uses weighted probability, even if the possibility of a credit loss occurring is low, can help inform the\nlikelihood of incurring loss. The scenario-based analysis incorporates forward-looking information into the\nimpairment estimation using multiple forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nThe estimate of expected credit losses must reflect an unbiased probability-weighted amount that is\ndetermined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. For example, when assessing the impact of credit\nlosses in a portfolio against shocks on major macroeconomic indicators (for example, unemployment and\nGDP), each scenario implies a different path for credit losses. These losses can then be aggregated using the\nprobability of a scenario occurring.\nFigure 1: Impairment calculations workflow under multiple scenarios.\nw1\n1\nMacro Scenario 1\nw2\n2\nMacro Scenario 2\nCalculate PD for each\nCalculate a weighted\nscenario and then\nPortfolio and Model average lifetime ECL\nweighted average PD\nInputs based on the likelihood\nbased on the likelihood\nof the scenarios\nof the scenarios\nw3\n3\nMacro Scenario 3\n.\n.\n.\nwn\n.\nn\nMacro Scenario n\n7 MARCH 2017 FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE ON IMPAIRMENTS USING EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nConclusion\nThe new impairment accounting standard based on the expected credit loss of a financial asset is a welcome\nconvergence between credit risk management practices and the new accounting standards. The current\nincurred loss (IL) approach to impairment accounting was reactive in recognizing credit losses. Although the\nexpected credit loss model under the new accounting standards has its share of implementation challenges,\nthe new guideline is a step toward a more proactive and effective loss recognition method.\nThe core benefits of the impairment model include:\n» Early recognition of expected credit losses and consistency with standardized pricing or valuation of\nfinancial instruments\n» Economically relevant and forward-looking approach is closer to the future value concept in determining\nthe initial carrying value of a financial asset\n» Increased transparency and reduced uncertainty over loan valuations enables financial institutions to\nacquire easy and economical funding\n» Greater convergence with regulatory capital models when considering a few adjustments to existing risk-\nrating models\nBecause this convergence comes with certain challenges in terms of pressure on capital ratios due to\nincreased impairment provisioning, financial institutions must assess the degree of impact on their capital\nand actively create a plan to implement the prescribed models.\n8 MARCH 2017 FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE ON IMPAIRMENTS USING EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nReferences\n» IFRS 9 guidance on accounting for expected losses issued by the Basel Committee (Feb 2015) BCBS\n» IFRS 9 standards (Transition Resource Group for Impairment of Financial Instruments, Dec 2015).\n» “IFRS 9 Impairment Regulations: Implementation Challenges and Potential Solutions”, Moody’s Analytics\nDec 2015\n9 MARCH 2017 FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE ON IMPAIRMENTS USING EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSMMOOOODDYY’’SS AANNAALLYYTTIICCS\n© 2017 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
