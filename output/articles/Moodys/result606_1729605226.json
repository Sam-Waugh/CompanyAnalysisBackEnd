With this additional economic support, real GDP\ngrowth would be robust at nearly 8% this year and almost 4% next, bringing the economy back almost to\nfull employment by fall 2022. Given the complicated politics of what Biden is proposing, it would likely have to\nbe passed under budget reconciliation rules requiring only a majority vote in the Senate. Even then, we expect the\nlegislation that ultimately gets through Congress to be no more than half the size proposed, setting the stage for\nanother fiscal policy proposal later this year along the lines of Biden’s “Build Back Better” campaign agenda. One\nway or another, through this step or over several steps, we ultimately expect fiscal support to the economy under\nthe new Biden administration that totals close to what was proposed Thursday.
