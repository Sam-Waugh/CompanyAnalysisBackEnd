WURM AND BERNARD YAROS\nT\nhe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank precipitated a sudden loss of confidence in the banking\nsystem, prompting bank runs, and forcing the U.S. government to provide extraordinary support to\nthe system. Unlike the global financial crisis over a decade ago, in which banks and other financial\ninstitutions suffered massive credit losses, the recent crisis was caused by surging interest rates, resulting\nin large declines in the market value of U.S. Treasury and government-backed mortgage securities held\nby the banking system. The crisis seems to have abated with the government’s aggressive response, and\nthe broader banking system remains well capitalized. But the system remains under significant pressure\nas interest rates continue to rise and the economy’s growth slows. In our baseline economic outlook,\nwe assume the worst of the crisis is over, and while the fallout on credit and economic growth will be\nmeaningful, it will not be enough to tip the economy into a recession.\nBut what if the banking crisis is not over? We consider two alternative scenarios, the first assumes that the\ncurrent calm in the financial system is brief. There are more bank failures, and depositors quickly lose faith\nthat they will be made whole by the government and the deposit runs restart. The banking system signifi-\ncantly tightens its underwriting standards and restricts credit to households and businesses. In the second\nscenario, we assume that the crisis abates for a while, but inflation remains persistent, forcing the Federal\nreserve to continue raising interest rates, resulting in more losses on banks’ security holdings, prompting\nmore failures and bank runs late this year and early next. Both scenarios depend on policymakers mistak-\nenly failing to immediately fully backstop the banking system.\nHow we got here\nWhile the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank happened suddenly, the bank’s balance sheet had been under\nsignificant pressure for the past year as rapidly rising interest rates led to a sharp decline in the value of the\nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities it owned (see Chart 1). These losses continued to grow as rates\nrose through early March at the same time that depositors were actively drawing down their accounts. A\nfailed attempt to raise additional capital along with a series of social media posts questioning the viability\nof the institution triggered a bank run that precipitated SVB’s collapse.\nSVB differed from other financial institutions in critical ways that made it particularly vulnerable to failure.\nparticularly important, its portfolio was concentrated in long-term Treasury and government-backed mort-\ngage securities. While these investments had no credit risk, they were fully exposed to interest rate risk. As\ninterest rates rose rapidly last year, the marked-to-market value of the securities declined along with SVB’s\ncapital cushion (see Chart 2). Although global systemically important or G-SIB banks tend to have a higher\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 2Chart 1: Rapidly Rising Interest Rates\nTreasury yields and fed funds rate, ppt\n5.0 1\n4.5 0.9\n4.0 0.8\n3.5 0.7\n3.0 0.6\n2.5 0.5\n2.0 0.4\n1.5 0.3\n1.0 0.2\n0.5 0.1\n0.0 0\n19 20 21 22 23\n10-yr Treasury rate 2-yr Treasury rate 3-mo Treasury rate Fed funds rate\nSources:Federal Reserve Board, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 1\nChart 2: SVB Is an Outlier…\n2022Q4, %\n14 13.1\n12.1\n12\n10.9\n9.9\n10\n8 7.1\n6\n4\n2\n0.1\n0\nG-SIB Large regional SVB\nTier 1 capital ratio Marked-to-market Tier 1\nSources: Goldman Sachs, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 2\nmarked-to-market Tier 1 capital ratio and less risk of suffering catastrophic losses due to their globally\ndiversified holdings and active interest rate hedging programs than regional banks, SVB’s position was an\noutlier even among large regional banks.\nIn addition, the mix of SVB’s liabilities differed significantly from its peers with a disproportionately small\nshare of retail deposits and a large share of uninsured deposits that exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation’s $250,000 deposit insurance threshold (see Chart 3). The average size of a deposit account at\nSVB when it failed is estimated at close to $1.25 million, compared with $177,000 at large regional banks.\nSVB’s large commercial depositors had a strong incentive to move their deposits to higher yielding money\nmarket accounts when interest rates rose. Given the threat that they would lose their uninsured deposits,\nthe depositors were especially sensitive when rumors of the bank’s collapse started to circulate.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 3Chart 3: …A Big Outlier…\n2022Q4, %\n60\nAvg deposit account at SVB is\n49\n50 $1.25 mil compared to $177k at\ntypical regional bank.\n40\n35\n30\n20\n10 7\n3\n0\nShare of deposits that are retail Share of FDIC-insured deposits\nRegional bank SVB\nSources: Goldman Sachs, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 3\nThe risk of additional bank failures due to similar asset liability mismatches remains but has been reduced\nby the recent actions of bank managers and regulators. Investors are scouring bank balance sheets for signs\nof weakness, while government agencies such as the FDIC, the Fed, and Federal Home Loan Banks are step-\nping in to identify and resolve risks and provide additional liquidity (see Chart 4).\nChart 4: …But the System Is Struggling to Find Liquidity\nFHLB advances, $ bil\n1,100\n1,000 Federal Home Loan Bank advances are SVB\nFinancial crisis\n900 loans to banks, collateralized by the bank’s failure\nmortgage securities to help meet depositor Pandemic\n800\ndemands and other liquidity needs.\n700\n600\n500\nFHLB\n400 membership\nS&L\n300 expansion\ncrisis\n200\n100\n0\n85 90 95 00 05 10 15 20\nSources: FHFA, BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 4\nWhile the risk of bank runs and failures cannot be discounted, the financial system as a whole remains well\ncapitalized. The system’s Tier 1 capital ratio is as high as it has ever been (see Chart 5). Interest rate hedging\nalong with held-to-maturity accounting also reduces the risk that institutions are deemed insolvent. Bank\nearnings and profitability may suffer as positions in securities are unwound, but this will be realized over\nyears with little immediate consequence. And the banking system continues to be comfortably profitable,\nwith a return-on-assets across the system of more than 1%.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 4Chart 5: Financial System on Firm Financial Ground\nTier 1 capital ratio, commercial banks, %\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\nSources: FDIC, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 5\nBaseline scenario\nThe Moody’s Analytics March 2023 baseline (most likely) scenario assumes that scrutiny of bank portfolios\nand confidence-building measures undertaken by the U.S. Treasury, FDIC, and the Fed will limit contagion\nand the number of bank failures. Specifically, we assume that all bank deposits of failed banks will be guar-\nanteed by the U.S. government, regardless of whether the deposits are below or above the FDIC’s $250,000\ninsurance limit. The government’s full commitment to provide additional insurance appears to have calmed\ndepositors’ nerves and stemmed the outflow of deposits from small and midsize regional banks.\nIn addition, the Fed’s discount window and newly established Bank Term Funding program will provide suf-\nficient funding available to eligible depository institutions to help ensure banks can meet the demands of all\ntheir depositors. The BTFp allows banks to borrow from the Fed using their Treasury and mortgage securi-\nties valued at par, not at their lower marked-to-market value. Banks are also able to shore up their balance\nsheets and ensure they have sufficient capital to meet withdrawal requests through the FHLB’s advances\nprogram and intra-bank deposits. Business-as-usual operations from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the\nFederal Housing Administration along with somewhat lower fixed mortgage rates will lead to only modest\ndisruptions to the flow of single- and multifamily mortgage loans.\nAlthough the banking crisis is short-lived in the baseline scenario, small and midsize banks become mean-\ningfully more cautious in their underwriting standards, significantly curtailing lending to households and\nbusinesses. This is in addition to the tightening of lending standards that began a year ago (see Chart 6).\nInflation-adjusted GDp in 2023 will be reduced by 0.3% relative to Moody’s Analytics February 2023 base-\nline forecast, to 1.3%, as a result of lower consumption and investment.\nThe Fed continues to tighten monetary policy to bring down inflation in the near term but is assumed to be\nnear the end of its tightening cycle as pressure on energy and other prices wanes and as tightening bank lending\nstandards acts as a further brake on consumption and investment, equivalent to a 50- to 75-basis point increase\nin the federal funds rate. The terminal federal funds rate of 5%-5.25% is assumed to be reached by midyear and\nis expected to remain unchanged through early 2024, when inflation is closing in on the Fed’s target.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 5Chart 6: Banks Batten Down the Hatches\nNet % of banks tightening lending standards on…\n100 1\n0.9\n80\n0.8\n60 0.7\n0.6\n40\n0.5\n20\n0.4\n0 0.3\n0.2\n-20\n0.1\n-40 0\n90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nC&I to large firms C&I to small firms Credit cards CRE construction\nSources:FRB Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 6\nThe labor market will be negatively impacted by the tightening in monetary policy and bank lending but\nremains relatively resilient given the strong demand for workers. Employers will reduce the pace of hiring\nand allow positions to go unfilled but will keep layoffs to a minimum out of fear that they will be unable\nto hire quickly when the economy begins to reengage. The unemployment rate is expected to modestly\nincrease to just over 4% by this time next year as a result.\nAlternative scenario 1: Crisis continues\nIn our first alternative downside scenario, we assume that despite recent calm in the financial system, there\nis another rash of small-bank failures as they struggle with continued deposit outflows. Depositors remain\nunconvinced that the U.S. government will step in and guarantee their deposits. Even though the failed\ninstitutions are small, their failure spooks depositors more broadly, further exacerbating deposit outflows. A\nbroad-based bank run is ignited.\nDespite the unraveling banking system and economy, the Fed delays cutting interest rates given ongoing\nconcerns about persistently high inflation. The Treasury and FDIC also fail to convince depositors that they\nwill guarantee all deposits, small and big, as they continue to provide the guarantee on a bank-by-bank\nbasis and do not provide a blanket guarantee. These are significant policy errors, certainly in hindsight.\nFortunately, lawmakers agree to raise the Treasury debt ceiling, avoiding the additional financial carnage a\ndefault on Treasury debt would bring. However, congressional gridlock and partisan infighting result in no\nadditional fiscal measures to support the eroding economy.\nThe dramatic tightening in financial conditions and the collapse in confidence cause consumer spending\nand business investment to plunge, leading to a sharp decline in GDp, the loss of millions of jobs, and\nsurging unemployment (see Charts 7 and 8). A severe recession begins by the third quarter of this year.\nIn this scenario, the stock market plummets along with oil prices and the prices of other commodities.\nThere is a global flight to quality, which lifts the value of the U.S. dollar and pushes long-term interest\nrates lower.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 6Chart 7: Real GDP Falls Sharply in Alternative Scenarios…\nReal GDP, % change yrago\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nBaseline Crisis Continues On Inflation Trumps Financial Stability\nSources:BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 7\nChart 8: …And Unemployment Surges\nUnemployment rate, %\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nBaseline Crisis Continues On Inflation Trumps Financial Stability\nSources:BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 8\nrising loan defaults and weakening credit conditions further threaten bank capital and solvency, and banks\nrespond by further tightening lending standards. Only borrowers with pristine credit characteristics can get\ncredit, and those who do pay higher rates. Commercial real estate lending is disproportionately adversely\nimpacted by the bank tightening as weaker rents and higher vacancy rates lead to big declines in com-\nmercial real estate prices (see Chart 9). A wave of CrE mortgage defaults further depresses prices, causing\nbanks to book higher losses, further weakening their capital positions. House prices also drop nearly 20%\npeak to trough, hitting bottom in 2024 (see Chart 10).\npolicymakers ultimately reverse themselves in the face of these rapidly deteriorating conditions. By the\nfourth quarter of 2023, they commit to guarantee all bank deposits to calm depositors’ nerves and stem\nthe outflow of deposits from regional to large money center banks.

By the end of 2024, the Fed has cut the fed funds rate to as low as 1% to revive the\nstruggling economy.\nThe lower interest rates ultimately support the value of bank holdings of Treasuries and mortgage secu-\nrities, improving their liquidity positions and lowering the threat of additional bank runs. The Treasury\nyield curve remains inverted—with long-term rates below short-term rates—through much of 2024 but\nshifts to an upward slope by 2025, helping to stabilize bank balance sheets and earnings (see Chart 11).\nThe reopening of the credit spigot that results supports the economic recovery led by home sales and\nnew construction.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 8Chart 11: Treasury Yield Curve Remains Inverted for Longer\nDifference between 10-yr and 2-yr Treasury yields, %\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nBaseline Crisis Continues On Inflation Trumps Financial Stability\nSources:Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 11\nThe economy’s long-run performance is diminished in this scenario as weaker business investment perma-\nnently weighs on productivity growth and lower labor force participation weighs on labor force growth. The\nlevel of real GDp is permanently lower, and the economy does not return to full employment until late in\nthe decade. The full-employment unemployment rate is somewhat higher given the hysteresis created by\nthe severity of the economic downturn.\nAlternative scenario 2: Inflation trumps financial stability\nIn our second, somewhat more pessimistic alternative scenario, the banking crisis briefly goes dormant.\nregulators forestall any bank failures for a while. However, inflation does not moderate as expected (see\nChart 12), prompting the Fed to aggressively hike interest rates through this fall. The federal funds rate rises\nto well over 6% (see Chart 13). The Fed prioritizes bringing down inflation over concern about the stability\nChart 12: Higher and More Persistent Inflation…\nConsumer price index, % change yrago\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nBaseline Crisis Continues On Inflation Trumps Financial Stability\nSources:BLS, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 12\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 9of the financial system. Long-term rates also rise due to the higher inflation and the monetary tightening\n(see Chart 14). The Treasury yield curve remains inverted through summer 2024, as the federal funds rate\nrises more than the 10-year Treasury yield.\nChart 13: …Prompting Federal Reserve to Slam the Brakes\nFed funds rate, %\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nBaseline Crisis Continues On Inflation Trumps Financial Stability\nSources:Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 13\nChart 14: Long-Term Treasury Yields Rise…\n10-yr Treasury rate, %\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nBaseline Crisis Continues On Inflation Trumps Financial Stability\nSources:Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 14\nThe higher interest rates further undermine the value of bank holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Despite government efforts to shore up bank balance sheets and reassure depositors, a string of\nbanks become insolvent and fail under the weight of their marked-to-market portfolio losses. Depositors at\nsmall and midsize banks shift more of their funds to large money center banks under the belief that larger\nbanks are too big to fail, and big-bank deposits will be fully backstopped by the government.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 10Fanning these fears, policymakers make the mistake of providing deposit guarantees and addressing bank\nresolutions on a one-off basis. Depositors panic, including many small-business owners, threatening trans-\nactional accounts and payroll deposits. Confidence is shattered as banks fail. Contagion triggers a series of\nbank runs. The Fed’s discount window and BTFp are expanded to make additional funding available to eli-\ngible depository institutions, but this is insufficient to restore confidence. Banks that take advantage of the\nfacilities are viewed with increased suspicion, accelerating deposit transfers to larger banks, money market\naccounts, and short-term Treasury securities.\nLending to households and businesses dries up as banks focus on shoring up their liquidity. Flush with new\ndeposits, large banks have the capacity to originate loans but tighten their lending standards as the reces-\nsion intensifies and credit losses grow. CrE lending is hurt disproportionately since regional banks account\nfor two-thirds of all CrE lending. Many property owners are unable to refinance their mortgages, triggering\na wave of defaults, and price declines further erode the value of banks’ loan portfolios. The multifamily\nmarket holds up somewhat better as government-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to provide\nfinancing to property owners.\nA sharp contraction in consumption and business investment due to the credit crunch pushes the economy\ninto a severe recession. GDp falls more than 4% in 2024, and the unemployment rate rises to a peak of over\n8%. The rising unemployment rate leads to a sharp increase in the number of missed mortgage payments,\ntriggering a wave of foreclosures. House prices drop due to additional defaults as millions of homeowners\nexperience job losses and negative equity in their homes. Stock prices crater (see Chart 15).\nChart 15: …And Stock Prices Crater\nS&P 500 index\n6,000\n5,500\n5,000\n4,500\n4,000\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nBaseline Crisis Continues On Inflation Trumps Financial Stability\nSources:S&P, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics 15\nThe banking system and economy eventually stabilize, but only when the Fed and policymakers firmly\nreverse course and provide a blanket backstop to the financial system at the end of 2024. Not only do they\nguarantee all depositors, but much as they did during the global financial crisis, they also guarantee the\ndebt issued by the banking system. This stabilizes confidence, the bank runs end, and banks begin to issue\ndebt again at lower rates. The economy slowly recovers.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 11Conclusion\nAngst over the banking crisis has receded significantly in recent days, consistent with our baseline scenario\nthat the worst of the crisis is behind us, and the economic fallout will be modest. However, interest rates\nremain high, and odds are the Fed will feel compelled to raise rates further to fully rein in inflation. The\nbanking system will thus remain under pressure given considerable unrealized losses on its security hold-\nings. More bank failures are a clear threat as are failures in the nonbank or so-called shadow part of the\nfinancial system. ruling out alternative, darker scenarios for the financial system and economy would thus\nbe a mistake.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS What if the Banking Crisis is not over? 12About the Authors\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
