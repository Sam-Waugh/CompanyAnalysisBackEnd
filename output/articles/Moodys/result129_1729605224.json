Recession is\na serious threat. But the Moody’s Analytics baseline forecast—the most-likely outlook—holds that\nthe economy will avoid a downturn. Call it a slowcession.1\nThe U.S. economy is sure to have a difficult 2023 as the Federal Reserve continues to aggressively push up\ninterest rates to quell the painfully high inflation (see Table 1). The federal funds rate, which was at the zero\nlower bound a year ago, has surged to near 4.5%, and strong signals from the Fed say it will soon go higher.\nInvestors anticipate a funds rate close to 5% in the next few months.\nRecession pessimism\nExpectations are strong that high and quickly rising interest rates will push the economy into recession at\nsome point in 2023. This includes everyone from CEOs—J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon has proclaimed a coming\neconomic “hurricane”—to a meaningful majority of economists in various consensus surveys. Most recently,\neconomists put the probability of a recession starting in 2023 at close to two-thirds (see Chart 1).\nChart 1: Consensus Is Convinced Recession Is Dead Ahead\nProbability of recession starting in 2023, %, survey taken Dec 15, 2022\n25 100\n90\n20 80\n70\n15 60\n50\n10 40\n30\n5 20\n10\n0 0\n<10 10-<20 20-<30 30-<40 40-<50 50-<60 60-<70 70-<80 80-90 >90\nProbability (L) Cumulative probability (R)\nSource: Moody's Analytics\n1 M oTodhyi’ss Adneaslyctricisption of the economic outlook was coined by Moody’s Analytics Deputy Chief Economist Cristian deRitis. December 2022\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 2Given how deep this recession pessimism runs there is reason to worry that it could be self-fulfilling.\nRecessions are ultimately a loss of faith—a loss of faith by consumers that they will hold on to their jobs, causing\nthem to curtail their spending, and a loss of faith by businesses that they will be able to sell what they produce,\ncausing them to lay off workers. A self-reinforcing vicious cycle—a recession—takes hold.\nTo be sure, a recession in the coming year would be consistent with many past business cycles in which the\neconomy overheated. That is, undesirably high inflation was ignited by a fast-growing economy operating\nbeyond full employment, forcing the Fed to quickly raise interest rates, which ultimately undermined the\neconomy and ended in recession. More often than not when the Fed has battled high inflation, its effort\nultimately has precipitated a downturn.\nA coming downturn would also be consistent with many tried-and-true leading indicators of recession.\nMost notable is the deep inversion of the Treasury yield curve. When the two-year Treasury yield rises above\nthe 10-year Treasury yield a recession invariably happens more than a year later. The two-year rose firmly\nabove the 10-year in July. The long lag between inversion and recession likely reflects how long it takes for a\ntightening in monetary policy to fully impact the economy.\nThe Conference Board’s leading economic index presages a similarly dark economic outlook. The index is a\ncompilation of 10 indicators that have historically led recessions. They include the shape of the yield curve,\nmeasures of interest rate-sensitive manufacturing and housing activity, and labor market indicators. When\nthe index falls sharply on a year-over-year basis and most of the indicators are down, as is now the case,\nrecession follows six to 12 months later (see Chart 2).\nChart 2: Leading Indicators Sound the Recession Alarm\n% change yrago\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n-4\n-8\n-12\nLeading economic indicatorslead recessions by 8 mo.\n-16\n-20\n76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nSources: The Conference Board, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics December 2022\nReining in inflation\nThere is no doubt the economy will struggle in the coming year as the Fed works to rein in the high infla-\ntion, but the baseline outlook holds that the Fed will be able to accomplish this without precipitating a\nrecession. That is, it will be able to raise rates high enough, fast enough to sufficiently quell the wage and\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 3price pressures, but not so high and fast that it knocks the wind out of the economy. This is a scenario that\nwe might well call a slowcession—growth that comes to a near standstill but that never slips into reverse.\nRecent developments are consistent with our more sanguine baseline view. Particularly important are lower oil\nprices. The price of West Texas Intermediate has dropped to near $80 per barrel and is back near where it was\nprior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is down from a peak of more than $120 per barrel in June, and not\nmuch higher than our estimate of the equilibrium price of oil—the price of producing and transporting the last\nbarrel of oil to the global markets. Gasoline prices are quickly falling in response. The cost of a gallon of regular\nunleaded is closing in on $3, down from this summer’s record high of $5.\nWeighing on oil prices are the weak Chinese economy, which is crimping the demand for oil, and the so-far suc-\ncessful implementation of the European Union’s sanctions on Russian oil and a price cap on Russian oil imposed\nby Western governments. This, despite OPEC’s recent production cuts. Although oil prices are not likely to remain\nthis low for long, since the Chinese economy will revive and Russia may yet respond more forcefully to the sanc-\ntions, the global oil market is adjusting admirably to the severe disruption caused by the Russian invasion.\nThe inflationary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also set to finally fade away. Freight rates are already\ndown, and purchasing managers are reporting an easing in supply-chain bottlenecks. Also, China’s recent deci-\nsion to end its zero-COVID policy means that country will no longer impose debilitating lockdowns to contain\nthe virus. It will take time for China’s economy to get back to full speed, in part because it is now being hit by a\nwave of infections. But once that wave passes, likely by summer, global supply chains should fully settle.\nBack to target\nInflation will have taken another big step back by this time next year. By then, the recent sudden stop in rent\nincreases on new apartment leases will show up as much slower growth in the cost of housing services. Weak\nnew rents reflect soft demand for rental units. A surge in rents last year after the pandemic lockdowns made\nrenting unaffordable for many. There is also more supply of rental units as a record number head to com-\npletion. Supply-chain problems, which limited the delivery of necessary building materials and appliances,\nare easing, as are labor shortages with the pandemic no longer significantly obstructing the number of foreign\nimmigrants working in the construction trades (see Chart 3).\nGetting inflation all the way back to the Fed’s inflation target will require a significant moderation in wage\ngrowth, allowing labor-intensive healthcare and other service providers to throttle their price increases.\nMuch of this script is still to be written, but recent job-market data show this is already beginning to happen.\nMonthly job gains have slowed to near 250,000, which is not too different from the growth in labor force sup-\nply, and traditional measures of slack in the job market have eased, such as unemployment and the employ-\nment-to-population ratio. Wage gains also appear to have topped out and are slowing quickly in industries\nsuch as leisure and hospitality and retailing, where until now they have been strong. To ensure inflation returns\nto the Fed’s target, job and wage growth will need to slow much more. But we are well on our way.\nHealthy finances\nAdding to optimism that a recession is avoidable are the economy’s generally solid fundamentals. Typically,\nprior to recessions, the economy is plagued by significant imbalances such as overleveraged households and\nbusinesses, speculative asset markets, an undercapitalized financial system that has extended too much\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 4Chart 3: Rent Growth Rolls Over\n% change yrago\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n19 20 21 22\nTotal rental Lifestyle rental Rent by necessity\nSources: Yardi, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics December 2022\ncredit, overbuilt real estate markets, or financially stretched state and local governments. For the most part\nnone of these imbalances exist today.\nFirst are the healthy finances of the typical American household. Despite everything from the pandemic to\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are plenty of jobs, unemployment remains low, and layoffs are about\nas low as ever. Tech, housing-related and financial services companies are cutting payrolls, but those losing\ntheir jobs are quickly finding new ones.\nMany households saved a lot more than usual during the pandemic; stuck-at-home families were not able\nto spend like they normally would. Middle-income and especially high-income households are flush, and\nwhile they are now drawing down their checking accounts, they still have plenty of cash to supplement\ntheir purchasing power—an estimated $1.7 trillion as of November. Most households have also done a good\njob managing their debts. The share of their incomes going toward principal and interest payments is near\na record low, and for the most part these payments will not increase with the higher interest rates. Through\nthe various mortgage refinancing waves of recent years, households paid off higher-cost and variable-rate\ncredit card debt with long-term, fixed-rate mortgages (see Chart 4).\nIn our consumer-oriented economy, shoppers are the firewall between an economy in recession and an\neconomy that skirts a downturn. While the firewall is sure to come under pressure, particularly as financially\nhard-pressed low-income households struggle, it should continue to hold.\nAmerican businesses are also in good financial shape. They are making lots of money, with close to record profit\nmargins. They have been careful, for the most part, not to take on too much debt, and they were good at locking\nin record-low interest rates when those were available. Businesses are also investing in labor-saving technologies\nand improving the resilience of their supply chains, as they adjust admirably to pandemic-related disruptions.\nSome businesses are sure to run into trouble as the economy slows. They will be forced to cut jobs and invest-\nments, but most of these will be companies levered up by private equity firms that were looking to juice their\nreturns. There are not enough of these companies for their cuts to become an economywide problem.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 5Chart 4: Excess Saving Is Drawn Down, but There’s Plenty Left\nExcess household saving, $ tril, 2020\n2.8\nExcess savings is the extra saving\n2.4 households did during the pandemic\ndue largely to sheltering in place and\n2.0 significant government support.\n1.6\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n0.0\nJan-20 Apr-20 Jul-20 Oct-20 Jan-21 Apr-21 Jul-21 Oct-21 Jan-22 Apr-22 Jul-22 Oct-22\nSources: BEA, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics December 2022 4\nWell-capitalized banks\nThe nation’s banking system is on about as strong financial ground as it has ever been. In the wake of the\nfinancial crisis more than a decade ago, regulators have required banks to hold substantial amounts of capital—the\nfinancial cushion to absorb losses on loans and other investments. They must also engage in stress tests to deter-\nmine how they would perform in the most difficult conditions, like a pandemic, and make appropriate changes. It is\nworking. There is neither too much credit (like before the financial crisis when lenders gave loans to households and\nbusinesses that could not reasonably pay them back) nor too little credit (like after the crisis when even credit-\nworthy borrowers could not get loans in that credit crunch). Credit growth is just right (see Chart 5).\nChart 5: Banking System Rock Solid\n%\n1.50 15\n1.25\n14\n1.00\n13\n0.75\n0.50 12\n0.25\n11\n0.00\n10\n-0.25\n-0.50 9\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21\nTier 1 capital ratio (R) Return on assets (L)\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics December 2022 5\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 6Low vacancy, flush governments\nPrior to recessions, overly optimistic developers typically build way too many homes. Vacancy rates are\nhigh and rising. Homebuilding thus collapses when conditions turn unfavorable, exacerbating the economic\ndownturn. Not so this time. Homebuilding has consistently lagged housing demand since the financial crisis,\nresulting in record-low vacancy rates and a severe shortage especially of affordable housing. We estimate\nthe shortfall at near 1.6 million homes, about the number of homes built in a typical year. While housing is\nunder pressure from the recent surge in mortgage rates and decline in affordability, the shortage of housing\nshould put a floor under the market.\nState and local governments are also in tip-top financial shape with overflowing rainy-day funds. Tax revenues\nhave been strong until recently, and the American Rescue Plan, the massive federal fiscal support package passed\nearly in the Biden administration, set aside hundreds of billions for local jurisdictions. In most recessions, state\nand local governments are in precarious financial straits and given their balanced budget requirements have no\nchoice but to make cuts in jobs and programs, further hurting the economy. There is little prospect of this\nhappening this time around.\nFed misstep\nDespite the improving inflation outlook and sturdy fundamentals, the economy faces a number of serious\nthreats that could quickly push it into recession. Most significant is the prospect of the Fed making an error\nin setting monetary policy, sparking a recession that would have been unnecessary to achieve its inflation\ntarget. Getting policy right is never easy, but it has been particularly difficult given the wild swings in growth\nand inflation caused by the pandemic and Russian invasion.\nThis is evident from the mistake the Fed was making a year ago; it had waited too long to begin normalizing\npolicy from the extraordinary measures it took at the height of the pandemic. A year ago, the federal funds\nrate was still at the zero lower bound and the Fed was continuing its quantitative easing—purchasing Treasury\nand mortgage-backed securities—to push down long-term rates. This was inconsistent with economic and\nfinancial market conditions at the time. Indeed, the Fed’s reaction function used in our macroeconometric model\nof the economy, which is based on various factors including inflation, inflation expectations, unemployment, the\nfull-employment unemployment rate, financial conditions, and the value of the U.S. dollar, suggests the funds\nrate should have already been at 2.5%. This is in line with most estimates of the so-called equilibrium rate, or\nr-star—the rate that is neither supporting nor restraining economic growth. It is unfair to be overly critical of the\nFed. It was impossible at the time to know how serious the fallout from the pandemic and Russian invasion would\nbe. In hindsight, though, the Fed’s inaction was a mistake that helped to entrench inflation (see Chart 6).\nMonetary policy since then has nearly caught up with current economic and financial market conditions.\nThe reaction function suggests the funds rate should be close to 5%, consistent with investors’ current\nexpectations of the terminal funds rate—the highest the funds rate will go during this rate cycle. But it is\nreasonable to worry that the Fed will make another misstep given the highly uncertain environment and the\nFed’s clear difficulty navigating through it. This time the most likely error would be for the central bank to\ncontinue raising rates well above 5%, precipitating a recession in an unnecessary effort to ensure inflation is\nnot a problem. A less likely Fed error would be to end the rate hikes prematurely, perhaps on a thought that\ninflation is set to moderate. But instead, inflation becomes more endemic. The Fed would not be able to let\nthat stand and would ultimately hike rates more aggressively than before, causing a recession, albeit not\nuntil 2024.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 7Chart 6: Federal Reserve Scrambles to Catch Up\n%\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\nAs of early 2022, QE added $5 trilto the Fed’s\n-2 balance sheet, equal to 20% of GDP and the\n-3 The target funds rate is based on equivalent of an additional approximately 50\nan estimated reaction function. bps on the federal funds rate.\n-4\n-5\n19 20 21 22\nEffective funds rate Target funds rate\nSources: Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics December 2022\nFinancial fault lines\nThere is also the threat that something in the financial system breaks under the weight of the high and\nquickly rising rates. This has not happened so far. Asset prices have corrected, but the retreat has been more\nor less orderly. Households are less wealthy given the last year’s decline in stock, bond and crypto prices,\nand house prices seem set to fall substantially. Nevertheless, households remain wealthier than they were\neven before the pandemic, and the impact on household spending has been hard to see.\nThings could quickly change, of course. The decline in stock prices to date has been largely caused by the surge\nin interest rates, as investors have yet to discount a meaningful decline in corporate profits. As a reminder, stock\nprices equal the discounted present value of expected future profit growth. Stock prices fall if the discount rate\nrises and/or investors anticipate a tough economy and weaker profits. Rates are up a lot over the past year, but\ninvestors’ profit expectations have held up. This is different from bear markets in the lead-up to past recessions.\nHowever, earnings are sure to weaken, and if investors then meaningfully mark down their earnings forecasts,\nstock prices could take another big leg down. The loss of wealth may be too much for households to shrug off,\nand they will pull back on spending—the consumer firewall burns down.\nThe decline in house prices could also be more severe than expected. We project a close to double-digit\npeak-to-trough decline in house prices through mid-decade as the market adjusts to the last year’s doubling\nin fixed mortgage rates. House prices soared throughout much of the pandemic, and combined with higher\nborrowing costs, housing affordability and demand have been hit hard. While the coming house price declines\nwill be significant, they should be limited by the severe shortage of homes—the homeowner vacancy rate\nis at a record low—and only a modest increase in foreclosures and distress sales. The latter is because of the\nstrong mortgage underwriting and the widespread adoption of plain vanilla 30-year fixed-rate mortgages\nsince the financial crisis.\nHowever, when house prices decline meaningfully and more homeowners become upside down on their\nmortgages (the value of their homes falls below the mortgage debt they owe) and incomes are disrupted\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 8in the weakening job market, there could be more defaults and distress sales than anticipated. House price\ndeclines could become self-reinforcing and the fallout on household wealth and spending more serious.\nOther fault lines in the financial system may exist but remain hidden. These could reveal themselves as the\nFed pushes interest rates higher and for longer. Possible problems include the rapidly growing market for leveraged\nloans to already highly indebted businesses, a lengthening list of emerging markets that appear to be on\nthe financial edge, and fintech and other nonbank financial institutions operating in the less regulated and\nopaque so-called shadow financial system. The collapsing crypto market is also worth a mention, although\nto date it appears too small and disconnected from the financial system to be a macroeconomic issue.\nKnown unknowns\nThe economy is also especially vulnerable to another shock. It would not take a big one to undermine\nalready-fragile sentiment (see Chart 7). There are the known unknowns, most notably the Russian invasion\nof Ukraine. It is impossible to fathom what Russian President Putin has in mind, but it is not difficult to\nconstruct many dark scenarios. He has yet to significantly curtail the Russian oil and natural gas exports\nthat provide critical revenue to finance his war, but cutoffs cannot be ruled out. There is also the pandemic,\nwhich appears to be receding with China as the last severely disrupted major economy. But there is no tell-\ning if the virus will prove more persistent and once again disrupt the global economy.\nChart 7: Known Unknowns Threaten the Economy\nHigh\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nMoody’s Analytics December 2022\nAlso worrisome is a likely partisan showdown over the Treasury debt limit, which will need to be raised\nagain by fall 2023. The debt limit sets a legal maximum on the nation’s outstanding debt. Once the limit\nis reached, the government can spend only what it receives in revenues. If the government has a deficit, as\nit consistently does, then someone is not going to get paid, at least not on time. That someone could be a\nsoldier, a Social Security recipient, a global investor who has previously lent money to the government, or\na long list of others who expect checks from the U.S. Treasury. Not being able to pay its bills on time means\nthe government would default.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 9\nksir\nfo\ndoohilekiL\nForbearance cliff\nHouse prices\nChina Heightened\nCrypto crash correct\nslowdown Russian aggression\nStock market crash Financial system\ninstability Federal Reserve\nBig OPEC+ cuts\nmissteps\nMajor cyberattack Sovereign U.S.-China\ndebt crisis tensions boil over\nSocial and\npolitical unrest Geopolitical Pandemic re-\nconflict intensifies Federal debt limit\nClimate breach\nchange\nLow\nLow Economic severity of risk HighThe debt limit was intended to force lawmakers into fiscal responsibility. If they reached the limit and faced\na default, so the thinking went, they would have to raise taxes or restrain government spending. That is not\nhow it has worked. Instead, often after much Sturm und Drang, lawmakers raise the limit in the nick of time\nto avoid a default but without making difficult policy choices. The drama intensifies at each debt-limit battle\nwith some lawmakers contemplating just how bad a breach of the limit would be for financial markets and\nthe economy. It would be bad. That the government pays what it owes in a timely way is a bedrock of our\neconomy and global financial system. It is why we pay the lowest interest rates in the world, and why the\nU.S. dollar is the global economy’s reserve currency. The economic benefits of this over the generations\nare incalculable.\nThere are also plenty of unknown unknowns, inherently unpredictable shocks most likely to emanate from\ngeopolitical flashpoints. Most notable of these are the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China over\na range of issues from trade practices and intellectual property to the independence of Taiwan, the uneasy\ntransition for the European economy precipitated by the U.K.’s Brexit, and ongoing struggles with Iran and\nNorth Korea. If anything veers even a bit off script, skittish consumers and businesses will quickly pull back,\nand the economy will sink into recession.\nAWOL fiscal policy\nThis may be more problematic in the new year with a new Congress and a divided federal government. For\neconomic policy, if history is a guide, the next two years will be frustrating, punctuated by legislative log-\njams and fiscal brinkmanship. Moreover, the economy will also be on its own. That is, if the economy suffers\na recession, no help will come from lawmakers. This may not be a big deal in a modest downturn precipitated\nby the Federal Reserve working to rein in the high inflation. Fiscal stimulus from deficit-financed tax cuts or\nspending increases would be working at cross-purposes with the Fed. However, recessions can take on a life\nof their own, and if one turns out to be more severe and long-lasting than expected, lawmakers will not be\nthere to save the day. The government will not have the economy’s back.\nConclusion\nCalls for a recession in the coming year are loud and widespread. To be sure, recession risks are uncomfortably\nhigh given runaway inflation and the Federal Reserve’s effort to rein it in through aggressive interest rate hikes.\nAnd under almost any scenario, the economy is set to have a difficult 2023. But inflation is quickly moderating,\nand the economy’s fundamentals are sound. With a bit of luck and some reasonably deft policymaking by the\nFed, the economy should avoid an outright downturn. If so, we may dub it a slowcession. It is important not to\nbe Pollyannish, but it is also important not to convince ourselves that a recession is inevitable. It is not.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 10Table 1: Moody’s Analytics December 2022 Baseline Economic Outlook\n2020Q1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020Q4 2021Q1 2021Q2 2021Q3 2021Q4 2022Q1 2022Q2 2022Q3 2022Q4\nReal GDP, 2012$ bil 18,990 17,379 18,744 18,924 19,216 19,544 19,673 20,006 19,924 19,895 20,039 20,082\nAnnualized % change -4.6 -29.9 35.3 3.9 6.3 7.0 2.7 7.0 -1.6 -0.6 2.9 0.8\n% change yr ago 0.8 -8.4 -2.0 -1.5 1.2 12.5 5.0 5.7 3.7 1.8 1.9 0.4\nNonfarm employment, mil 151.9 133.8 140.5 142.5 143.7 145.2 146.9 148.6 150.4 151.6 152.7 153.5\nAvg monthly change, ths 102.6 -6034.4 2229.4 666.1 420.8 484.2 565.1 586.4 573.4 408.8 381.8 258.2\nUnemployment rate, % 3.8 13.0 8.8 6.8 6.2 5.9 5.1 4.2 3.8 3.6 3.6 3.7\nChange yr ago, bps -7 937 520 317 240 -707 -373 -253 -240 -230 -153 -55\nConsumer prices, 1982-84=100 258.6 256.4 259.4 260.9 263.5 268.8 273.2 278.4 284.6 291.8 295.9 298.8\n% change yr ago 2.1 0.4 1.3 1.2 1.9 4.8 5.3 6.7 8.0 8.6 8.3 7.3\nFederal funds rate, % 1.23 0.06 0.09 0.09 0.08 0.07 0.09 0.08 0.12 0.76 2.20 3.68\n10-yr Treasury yield, % 1.37 0.69 0.65 0.86 1.34 1.59 1.32 1.53 1.95 2.93 3.10 3.81\nS&P 500 Index 3,069 2,929 3,322 3,554 3,863 4,183 4,421 4,601 4,467 4,110 3,974 3,793\n% change yr ago 12.8 1.6 12.3 15.2 25.8 42.8 33.1 29.4 15.6 -1.7 -10.1 -17.6\nFHFA House Price Index 451.93 453.89 460.62 473.44 486.05 510.22 537.27 558.94 581.14 617.42 626.28 624.33\nAnnualized % change 5.7 1.7 6.1 11.6 11.1 21.4 23.0 17.1 16.9 27.4 5.9 -1.2\n% change yr ago 5.1 4.4 4.9 6.2 7.5 12.4 16.6 18.1 19.6 21.0 16.6 11.7\nSources: BEA, BLS, FHFA, S&P, Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics\nTable 1: Moody's Analytics December 2022 Baseline Economic Outlook\n2023Q12023Q22023Q32023Q4 2024Q12024Q22024Q32024Q4 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nReal GDP, 2012$ bil 20,088 20,122 20,196 20,275 20,380 20,503 20,642 20,792 19,036 18,509 19,610 19,985 20,170 20,579\nAnnualized % change 0.1 0.7 1.5 1.6 2.1 2.4 2.7 2.9 2.3 -2.8 5.9 1.9 0.9 2.0\n% change yr ago 0.8 1.1 0.8 1.0 1.5 1.9 2.2 2.6\nNonfarm employment, mil 153.8 154.0 154.2 154.4 154.7 155.0 155.3 155.7 150.9 142.1 146.1 152.0 154.1 155.2\nAvg monthly change, ths 101.9 73.9 59.8 67.7 82.9 107.9 121.4 110.1 166.3 (729.0) 329.7 494.7 172.7 87.8\nUnemployment rate, % 3.8 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.2 4.1 4.0 3.9 3.7 8.1 5.4 3.7 4.0 4.1\nChange yr ago, bps 0 36 50 48 39 15 -5 -24 -22 442 -273 -170 34 6\nConsumer prices, 1982-84=100 301.4 303.8 305.7 307.7 309.5 311.2 312.9 314.5 255.6 258.8 271.0 292.8 304.6 312.0\n% change yr ago 5.9 4.1 3.3 3.0 2.7 2.4 2.4 2.2 1.8 1.2 4.7 8.0 4.1 2.4\nFederal funds rate, % 4.53 4.83 4.83 4.78 4.55 4.30 4.05 3.77 2.16 0.37 0.08 1.69 4.74 4.17\n10-yr Treasury yield, % 4.03 4.22 4.29 4.23 4.18 4.05 3.84 3.78 2.15 0.89 1.45 2.95 4.19 3.96\nS&P 500 Index 3,846 3,976 4,093 4,093 4,082 4,078 4,080 4,105 2,913 3,219 4,267 4,086 4,002 4,086\n% change yr ago -13.9 -3.3 3.0 7.9 6.1 2.6 -0.3 0.3 6.1 10.5 32.6 -4.2 -2.1 2.1\nFHFA House Price Index 620.67 615.67 609.96 604.08 598.32 593.04 588.48 585.20 437.5 460.0 523.1 612.3 612.6 591.3\nAnnualized % change -2.3 -3.2 -3.7 -3.8 -3.8 -3.5 -3.0 -2.2 4.6 5.1 13.7 17.0 0.0 -3.5\n% change yr ago 6.8 -0.3 -2.6 -3.2 -3.6 -3.7 -3.5 -3.1\nSources: BEA, BLS, FHFA, S&P, Federal Reserve, Moody's Analytics\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS SlowceSSion 11About the Author\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
