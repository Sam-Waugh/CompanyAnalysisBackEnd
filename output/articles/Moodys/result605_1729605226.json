Introduction\nCredit portfolios, consisting of loans, bonds, and other credit assets, make up a large portion of all assets on most financial\ninstitutions’ balance sheets. Hence, credit portfolio value, return, and risk are key drivers of shareholder/stakeholder value, return,\nand risk. Institutions can increase stakeholder value by increasing portfolio return/risk while also ensuring capital adequacy and\nregulatory compliance. This process, for the most part, requires five key steps:\n1. Measuring portfolio risk and ensuring capital adequacy\n2. Quantifying each exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio risk\n(An exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio risk is defined as the increase in portfolio risk for a dollar more of that exposure\nand is used to perform Steps 3−5)\n3. Setting limits to prevent excessive risk concentrations\n4. Increasing/decreasing credit exposure to increase portfolio return/risk\n5. Pricing and sizing new deals to increase portfolio return/risk\nWhile Steps 4 and 5, ultimately, and most directly, increase stakeholder value, they cannot be effectively performed without first\nsecuring regulatory approval, favorable credit rating, and stakeholder confidence by performing Step 1, i.e., measuring portfolio risk\nand ensuring capital adequacy, then performing Step 2 to quantify each exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio risk, and then\nusing the marginal measures to effectively perform Steps 3, 4, and 5. (Using marginal return/risk measures to perform Steps 4 and\n5 leads to a portfolio with optimal (maximum) return/risk, where marginal return/risk impact is equal across all exposures in the\noptimal portfolio). Each of the five steps involves key questions and sub-steps that must be addressed and performed in order to\nincrease portfolio return/risk and, thereby, increase stakeholder value.\nKey Steps and Questions\n1.

Section 7 describes additional functionalities of PortfolioStudio.\nSection 8 concludes.\n3 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK2. Measuring Portfolio Risk and Ensuring Capital Adequacy\nWhile regulatory requirements and expectations differ based on jurisdiction and institution type, most financial institutions\nunderstand the need to assess and ensure capital adequacy from regulatory, accounting, and economic perspectives, together with\nactual use of the capital adequacy assessment results and metrics. PortfolioStudio’s outputs inform, support, and enable\nregulatory, accounting, and economic decision-making by facilitating stress testing and calculating risk and return using CECL- or\nIFRS 9-based credit earnings, as well as economic or fair value methods.\nLoss Distribution: How much capital is required to absorb possible portfolio losses?\nPortfolioStudio uses the extensively validated Moody’s Analytics Global Correlation (“GCorr™”) framework, together with\nbottom-up Monte Carlo simulation, to simulate credit losses (due to credit migration and default) at a future horizon (typically\none year) for each exposure in the portfolio, taking into account standalone risk, as well as portfolio correlations and risk\nconcentrations.1 Exposure losses for all exposures and simulation trials are used to calculate the probability distribution of portfolio\nlosses at the specified future horizon, and to calculate crucial portfolio2 risk metrics, including:\n» Loss quantile (aka Credit Value at Risk (CVaR) or Economic Capital (“EC”))\nExample: 99.9 percentile loss corresponds to the capital required to absorb all but the worst 0.1% of portfolio losses and\ncan be compared with available capital (e.g. CET1) to assess capital adequacy. The quantile or confidence level (e.g. 99.9\npercentile) can be specified in PortfolioStudio to match regulatory or economic requirements or the survival probability\ncorresponding to the institution’s target credit rating.\n» Unexpected loss, i.e., standard deviation or volatility of portfolio losses at a future horizon\nNote: Expected return and expected loss measures are also calculated and reported by PortfolioStudio. Institutions can\nchoose whether PortfolioStudio calculates return and risk measures using loss based on economic or fair value or\n(optionally) loss based on CECL- or IFRS 9-based credit earnings.\n» List of macroeconomic variables ranked by their correlation with portfolio loss\nPortfolioStudio’s portfolio overview functionality outputs the above risk metrics, together with portfolio loss distribution and other\nrelevant metrics — all of which inform and support an institution’s capital adequacy assessment, capital planning and\nmanagement, risk strategy, risk appetite, and risk tolerance, and are increasingly being reported and communicated both internally\nand externally.\n1 PortfolioStudio is designed to explicitly analyze a broad range of asset classes (public and private firms, CRE, retail, sovereign, and project finance) and credit\ninstruments (term loans, revolving lines of credit, bonds, CDS, and structured products). GCorr is a multi-factor correlation model — consisting of close to\n1,000 geographical, sectoral, and national and regional macroeconomic factors — is updated and validated annually and is based on a long time series of\nempirical and granular data capturing intra- and inter-asset class correlations. For more information, see “An Overview of Modeling Credit Portfolios” by Levy\n(2013); “Modeling Credit Correlations: An Overview of the Moody’s Analytics GCorr Model” by Huang, Lanfranconi, Patel, and Pospisil (2012); and “Portfolio\nManagement of Default Risk” by Kealhofer and Bohn (2001).\n2 The same simulation is also used to calculate exposure and segment-level risk metrics, including marginal risk contributions and correlation with portfolio,\ndescribed later in this document.\n4 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKFigure 1 Distribution of portfolio value at horizon.\nNote: PortfolioStudio calculates return and risk measures and loss distribution using loss based on economic or fair value, or (optionally) loss based\non CECL- or IFRS 9-based credit earnings.\nStress Testing: What are the expected losses and capital requirements under stress scenarios?\nPortfolioStudio’s stress testing module uses a Monte Carlo simulation engine, together with the GCorr framework, to capture and\ncalculate systematic factors’ (e.g. country and industry factors) and macroeconomic factors’ (e.g. GDP, unemployment rate, etc.)\nimpacts on borrower credit quality and the resulting exposure and portfolio losses and credit earnings under user-specified or pre-\nloaded stress scenarios (e.g. CCAR scenarios). GCorr model coverage continues to expand and currently includes close to 1,000\ntotal factors, including about 250 national, regional, and international macroeconomic variables.\nPortfolioStudio’s single-period stress testing simulates portfolio loss and credit earnings to calculate, conditional upon a set of\nmacrovariables at horizon, portfolio expected loss (or expected credit earnings) and loss quantile (or credit earnings at risk), which\ncapture the uncertainty in loss (or credit earnings) due to uncertainty in factors other than those specified in the single-period\nstress scenario.\nPortfolioStudio’s multi-period stress testing is used to calculate expected losses, loss distribution, and capital requirements for\nfuture quarters, given a user-specified multi-quarter macroeconomic scenario. PortfolioStudio first calculates stressed PDs for each\nborrower, at each period of the scenario, and then, using the stressed PDs as inputs, performs risk analysis and calculates results for\neach period during the multi-period scenario, thus yielding a term structure of expected loss (or credit earnings), loss quantiles\n(credit earnings at risk), and capital requirements.\nSingle-period and multi-period stress testing results from PortfolioStudio can be used to:\n» Calculate expected loss, loss volatility, and capital requirements under stress scenarios\n» Benchmark similar results from alternative models or estimates\n» Assess capital adequacy, e.g. estimate the probability of exhausting the capital surplus by comparing distribution of\nportfolio loss and credit earnings and capital demand and supply under stress scenarios\n» Meet regulatory and internal requirements for stress testing, communication, and disclosures\n» Hedge assets, rebalance portfolio, set risk limits, and price risk based on sensitivity to stress\n5 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKFigure 2 Stress testing using PortfolioStudio.\nReverse Stress Testing: What scenarios, borrowers, sectors/regions contribute most to large losses?\nPortfolioStudio’s reverse stress testing module utilizes simulation results (including portfolio loss, tail risk contributions, and GCorr\nsystematic and macroeconomic factor realizations) to:\n» Identify macroeconomic scenarios corresponding to a given level of portfolio loss or credit earnings\n» Identify sectors and borrowers contributing most to such portfolio loss or credit earnings\n» Reveal and plan for hidden vulnerabilities in the portfolio\n» Benchmark against regulatory or other internal stressed scenarios\n» Select macroeconomic variables for stress testing\n6 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKFigure 3 Reverse stress testing approach using Monte Carlo simulation results.\nCapital Planning: What actions will be taken to maintain capital adequacy as stress scenarios unfold?\nPreviously described loss distribution, stress testing, and reverse stress testing results from PortfolioStudio can be used to:\n» Project capital demand and capital supply and assess capital adequacy under stress scenarios\n» Plan and determine management actions (e.g. capital increase or risk/exposure reduction) that will be taken to prevent\nand to recover from possible capital deficiencies, if and as stress scenarios unfold\n» Use such capital planning as part of internal capital adequacy assessment process and discussion with regulators,\nsupervisors, and stakeholders.\nRisk Appetite: What are the target levels (risk appetite) and limits (risk tolerances) for risk taking?\nPrior sections describe how PortfolioStudio can be used to measure portfolio risk (loss distribution, volatility, quantile, etc.) and\nperform stress testing and reverse stress testing to assess and ensure capital adequacy. Portfolio risk and capital adequacy\nassessment results and metrics from PortfolioStudio can then be used to estimate capital demand and supply and compare them\nwith market opportunity and risk strategy to inform and determine:\n» Risk capacity, i.e., the maximum amount of risk an institution can support in pursuit of its business objectives\n» Risk appetite, i.e., the target amount or range of risk an institution is willing to accept in pursuit of its business\nobjectives; risk appetite is lower than risk capacity to allow for a safety margin\nexample: risk appetite to have AA S&P rating and CET1/EC of 250%\no\n» Risk tolerance and risk limits, i.e., boundaries of risk taking within which an institution is willing to operate; risk appetite\nis articulated more qualitatively and at aggregate level, while risk tolerances and limits are more quantitative and\ngranular, e.g. borrower and segment limits\nexample of segment risk limit: automotive segment expected loss under CCAR adverse scenario shall not\no\nexceed 20% of total portfolio’s expected loss under CCAR adverse scenario\nThis section describes how PortfolioStudio can be used to measure portfolio risk, assess and ensure capital adequacy, and thereby\nsecure regulatory approval, favorable credit rating, and stakeholder confidence — not just from the normative (i.e., regulatory or\naccounting) perspective but also from internal economic perspective. In the next section, we describe the next key step in\nincreasing portfolio return/risk.\n7 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK3. Quantifying Each Exposure’s Incremental Impact on Portfolio Risk\nHaving measured portfolio risk and assessed and ensured capital adequacy, as described in Section 2, the institution can then focus\non increasing portfolio return/risk, which naturally and practically can only be done by taking incremental (marginal) actions on a\nselect few exposures or borrowers at a time. Selecting which exposures to increase or decrease requires calculating each exposure’s\nmarginal impact on portfolio return/risk (defined as the increase in portfolio return/risk for a dollar more of that exposure), and\nthen increasing those with the most favorable marginal impact on portfolio return/risk and decreasing those with the least\nfavorable marginal impact on portfolio return/risk.\nAn exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio return/risk:\n» Enables continual improvement of the portfolio from current state towards the optimal state (maximum return/risk),\neven as the optimal state changes in time as portfolio characteristics change;\n» Transcends limitations and conflicts of siloed measures, e.g. a return/risk measure calculated based on exposure’s impact\non a business line (sub-portfolio) may increase return/risk for that business line, but actually decrease return/risk for the\noverall institution (portfolio);\n» Is the most practical, actionable, and optimal measure for selecting which exposures to increase or decrease in order to\ncontinually increase portfolio return/risk.\nWhile a tail measure of portfolio risk such as 99.9 percentile loss (i.e., EC or CVaR) focuses on extremely large but rare losses and is\nused to assess capital adequacy, shareholders are more focused on measuring and minimizing loss volatility (i.e., standard\ndeviation of losses at future horizon), accounting for the full range of losses (small, medium, large, and extremely large) together\nwith their respective probabilities. In this document, an exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio tail risk (e.g. EC or a user-specified\nprobability interval (e.g. 99.9 +/- 0.1 percentile) of the loss distribution) is termed “Tail Risk Contribution,” whereas, an exposure’s\nmarginal impact on portfolio standard deviation (volatility) is termed “Risk Contribution”. PortfolioStudio calculates and reports\nboth: Risk Contributions and Tail Risk Contributions.\nRisk Contribution: What is the increase in portfolio risk for a $1 increase in exposure (notional)?\nExposure’s Risk Contribution (“RC”), defined as the increase in portfolio risk (i.e., standard deviation of portfolio value at horizon)\ni\nfor a $1 increase in that exposure (notional), can be shown to equal the exposure’s standalone risk per unit notional, i.e., standard\ndeviation of exposure value at horizon per unit notional (aka “unexpected loss” or “UL”), multiplied by the correlation between\ni\nexposure value and portfolio value at horizon (“CORR ”).\ni,p\nFigure 4 Risk contribution equation.\n∗\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖)=𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝐼𝐼 $1 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶 𝐼𝐼𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼 (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶E𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶x𝐶𝐶p𝐼𝐼o𝑡𝑡s)ur=e's𝐶𝐶 𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑝𝑝 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖\nExposure's Risk Unexpected Loss\nCorrelation between\nContribution (RC) = (UL), i.e. Standard\ni Exposure Value and i\nIncrease in Portfolio Deviation of\nPortfolio Value at\nRisk for $1 increase in Exposure Value at\nHorizon (CORR )\nExposure Notional i,p Horizon per unit\nNotional\nOnly the correlated portion of the exposure’s standalone risk (UL) contributes to and impacts the portfolio risk; the remaining\ni\nportion of UL, being uncorrelated with the portfolio, is diversified away.

Exposure-level Risk Contributions can then be appropriately weighted and\naveraged across borrowers or sub-portfolios (or segments) to calculate borrower- or segment-level Risk Contributions.\nRisk Concentrations: Which borrowers, sectors, and regions impact portfolio risk the most?\nRisk Contribution (RC), the increase in portfolio risk impact for a $1 increase in current exposure (notional), can be used to decide\nwhere to add/reduce the next $ of exposure, identify risk concentrations and exposures (or sectors) that could cause large losses in\na portfolio, and decide where to add/reduce exposure to increase diversification and reduce risk concentration and portfolio risk.\nPortfolioStudio outputs RC together with PD, LGD, maturity, standalone risk (UL), R-squared, notional, weight (notional as % of\ni\nportfolio notional), and correlation with portfolio (CORR ) (collectively “risk drivers”) for each exposure and segment and can be\ni,p\nused to measure, manage, and price risk and take incremental (marginal) actions to reduce risk concentrations and increase\nportfolio return/risk, as discussed in later sections. The following figures list RC and risk drivers for the top15 borrowers and sectors\nranked by RC. PortfolioStudio generates them in order to facilitate monitoring and analysis of risk concentrations, including\nborrower (name) and sector concentration, as shown below via illustrative examples for an example portfolio.\nFigure 5 Sources of borrower concentration.\n9 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKFigure 6 Sources of sector concentration.\nRisk Attribution: Which factors cause and explain exposure’s Risk Contribution level?\nUsers often want to understand why an exposure’s Risk Contribution (RC) is higher or lower and what drives the changes. Users\ncan use PortfolioStudio outputs to better understand, communicate, and act upon the reported risk measures for any exposure via:\ni. An annotated flowchart (see Figure 7) relating the inputs and risk drivers to intermediate and final risk outputs and\nshowing their levels.\nii. A table (see Figure 8) comparing the risk drivers and outputs of the chosen exposure with those of the relevant sector,\ngeography, segment, and portfolio.\niii.

We now turn to the next key step in increasing portfolio return/risk.\n11 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK4. Setting Limits to Prevent Excessive Risk Concentrations\nExposure- and segment-level marginal return/risk measures, calculated as expected return divided by Risk Contribution (RC), can\nbe used not only to increase portfolio return/risk via asset selection, as described in Section 5, but also to monitor marginal\nreturn/risk and prevent excessive risk concentrations by rejecting deals or reducing exposures that have high RC and low marginal\nreturn/risk and that would decrease portfolio return/risk. Doing so requires reliable tools and metrics and unflinching discipline.\nAs a practical, conservative alternative and/or supplementary approach, and as a backstop to the aforementioned marginal\nreturn/risk-based monitoring and limit setting, most institutions also calculate and enforce absolute notional limits in order to\nprevent excessive risk concentrations and to keep risk levels consistent with risk appetite and risk strategy. Limits based on\nnotional exposure are a good start, but they have significant limitations:\n» They do not account for borrower- or segment-specific risk.\n» They do not account for the impact of borrower’s or segment’s correlation and concentration relative to the portfolio.\n» They are more qualitative and subjective, and thus prone to subjective bias, and not easily defendable.\n» They involve a manual process and are difficult to update frequently.\n» They are not dynamic; they generally remain fixed despite changes to portfolio holdings and profile.\nPortfolioStudio overcomes these limitations by using a quantitative and risk-sensitive approach. It uses analytic formulas, together\nwith Monte Carlo simulation results, to calculate the relationship (“Risk vs. Notional Curve”) between a borrower’s or segment’s\n“Notional Weight” and the corresponding “Risk Contribution Weight” for varying levels of borrower’s or segment’s Notional Weight,\nassuming no change to the rest of portfolio. Risk Contribution Weight is defined as a borrower’s or segment’s notional-weighted\nRisk Contribution, as a fraction of the sum of notional-weighted Risk Contribution of all exposures in the portfolio.\nSegment Limits: What is the notional limit given a limit on each segment’s Risk Contribution?\nGiven a set of user-specified Segment Risk Contribution Weight Limits and using the aforementioned Risk vs. Notional Curve,\nPortfolioStudio calculates the corresponding set of “Risk-Adjusted Notional Limits” for each segment, assuming no change to the\nrest of the portfolio. Users can specify the Segment Risk Contribution Weight Limits to be the same or different across segments.\nIn addition to the GCorr industry and country segmentations, PortfolioStudio allows for up to four user-defined segmentations for\nsegment-level reporting, what-if analysis, stress testing, optimization, and limit setting.\nFigure 9 Limit setting using Risk vs. Notional Curves for segments in an example portfolio.\n12 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKFigure 10 Limit setting via PortfolioStudio.\nBorrower Limits: What is the notional limit given a limit on each borrower’s Risk Contribution?\nUsing a similar approach as that for limit setting for segments described above, PortfolioStudio can also calculate Risk-Adjusted\nNotional Limits for the top-20 borrowers ranked by notional-weighted Risk Contribution.\nTo review, this section describes how PortfolioStudio can be used to set Risk-Adjusted Notional Limits given a user-specified limit\non segment’s or borrower’s Risk Contribution Weight. This quantitative risk-sensitive limit setting can be performed periodically\nusing PortfolioStudio to reflect changes to portfolio holdings and their risk characteristics, as well as changes to risk appetite. In\nthe next section, we describe the next key step in increasing portfolio return/risk.\n13 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK5. Increasing/Decreasing Credit Exposure to Increase Portfolio Return/Risk\nPrior sections focused on risk, i.e., the denominator of return/risk ratio. In this section and the next, we describe how\nPortfolioStudio can be used to calculate and increase portfolio return/risk and stakeholder value. We also discuss relevant best\npractices and ways to overcome implementation challenges.\nAsset Selection: Which exposures should be increased/decreased to increase portfolio return/risk?\nWe can show that exposure’s (standalone) expected return equals that exposure’s marginal contribution to portfolio expected\nreturn, regardless of exposure notional and portfolio characteristics. Thus, an exposure’s Sharpe Ratio, defined as “expected return\n/ Risk Contribution,” is a marginal measure quantifying exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio return/risk and can be used to\ndecide which exposures to increase/decrease in order to increase portfolio return/risk. Portfolio return/risk can be increased by\nincreasing exposures with Sharpe Ratios higher than the portfolio Sharpe Ratio and decreasing exposures with Sharpe Ratios lower\nthan portfolio Sharpe Ratio. Portfolio Sharpe Ratio changes with the portfolio, and it can be used as a dynamic hurdle rate, without\nthe need to compare exposure’s Sharpe Ratio with an exogenously imposed hurdle rate, which often is static and not portfolio-\nsensitive, despite changes in the portfolio. Furthermore, using an exogenously imposed hurdle rate is superfluous (relative to using\nportfolio Sharpe Ratio as the hurdle rate) and may lead to asset selection that can actually decrease the portfolio’s Sharpe Ratio.3\nPortfolioStudio calculates and reports each exposure’s and segment’s expected return (or credit earnings based on CECL or IFRS 9)\nand Sharpe Ratio, together with Risk Contribution, correlation with portfolio, and other risk measures discussed previously, and\nwhich can be used to selectively increase/decrease exposures and increase portfolio return/risk. If regulatory or capital structure\nrequirements appear to constrain the said asset selection, the institution can overcome such apparent constraints by scaling down\n(decreasing) all current exposures in the portfolio, or by raising additional capital at market rates. In either case, and to the extent\nthere is no gain/loss relative to market price, the institution can continue to increase portfolio return/risk by rebalancing portfolio\nusing aforesaid marginal return/risk contributions, while simultaneously and independently meeting regulatory and/or economic\ncapital requirements.\nOptimal Allocation to Segments: Which segments should be grown/reduced and by how much, in order to maximize\nportfolio return/risk (Sharpe Ratio)?\nConsistent with the Sharpe Ratio-based asset selection discussed previously, and utilizing segment level results from Monte Carlo\nsimulation, PortfolioStudio’s Deal Allocation application quickly calculates segment level optimal investment amounts that\nmaximize portfolio return/risk, given user-specified investment budget and segment level buy/sell limits. Users can choose to\noptimize the portfolio via any of the four strategies:\n» Mean-Variance: minimize portfolio return volatility while meeting a target expected return\n» Minimum Volatility: minimize portfolio return volatility across all expected return levels\n» Maximum Sharpe Ratio: maximize portfolio Sharpe Ratio, i.e., expected return/return volatility\n» Risk Parity: to the extent possible, equalize each segment’s notional-weighted Risk Contribution\nEach of these optimization strategies can be performed on the portfolio with or without new deals. Each strategy can also be\nperformed under user-specified stress scenarios. If regulatory or capital structure requirements appear to constrain the said\noptimization, the institution can overcome such apparent constraints by scaling down (decreasing) all current exposures in a\nportfolio, or by raising additional capital at market rates. In either case, and to the extent there is no gain/loss relative to market\nprice, the institution can continue to increase portfolio return/risk by rebalancing portfolio using aforesaid marginal return/risk\ncontributions, while simultaneously and independently meeting regulatory and/or economic capital requirements.\n3 For example, an exposure “i” with Sharpe Ratio (SR) greater than an exogenously imposed hurdle rate (HR) but less than portfolio Sharpe Ratio (SR), i.e. HR\ni p\n< SR < SR, will pass the hurdle but will actually decrease portfolio Sharpe Ratio. Similarly, an exposure “i” with Sharpe Ratio (SR) less than an exogenously\ni p i\nimposed hurdle rate (HR) but greater than portfolio Sharpe Ratio (SR), i.e. HR > SR > SR, will fail the hurdle but will actually increase portfolio Sharpe Ratio.\np i p\n14 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKFigure 11 Segment-level optimization and deal allocation via PortfolioStudio.\nFigure 12 Increase in portfolio return/risk after performing deal allocation and portfolio optimization via PortfolioStudio.\nBefore Optimization After Optimization Change\nHolding Amount (Billion) $50.434 $60.435 19.83%\nExpected Return (ER) 1.73% 1.90% 9.58%\nUnexpected Loss (UL) 1.90% 1.80% -5.26%\nEconomic Capital (EC) 7.89% 8.21% 4.08%\nSharpe Ratio (ER/UL) 0.91 1.05 15.67%\nPortfolioStudio also calculates and plots the efficient frontier, showing the full range of possible return and risk levels for the\nportfolio, including the point (shown as a red cross in Figure 16) corresponding to the maximum Sharpe Ratio.\nFigure 13 Efficient frontier output from PortfolioStudio.\nTo review, this section describes how PortfolioStudio can be used to increase portfolio return/risk by Sharpe Ratio-based asset\nselection and segment-level portfolio optimization. The following section describes the next key step in increasing portfolio\nreturn/risk.\n15 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK6. Pricing and Sizing New Deals to Increase Portfolio Return/Risk\nThe prior section focused on how PortfolioStudio can be used to decide what to buy, sell, or hold to increase portfolio return/risk.\nWhat is equally important is to do so at the right price and with the correct size and terms. Sizing and structuring deals\nappropriately become even more important when the institution is a price-taker rather than a price-setter. PortfolioStudio’s deal\npricing module enables institutions to quickly calculate return and risk measures for a new deal or a basket of new deals,\nconsidering the deal’s standalone risk (driven mostly by PD, LGD, and maturity), as well as portfolio correlation and risk\nconcentrations. The module has an intuitive user interface that enables deal makers to conveniently specify borrower\ncharacteristics (e.g. notional, PD, LGD, etc.) and deal terms and conditions (e.g. coupon, maturity, etc.). Users can also choose to\nincorporate the impact of CECL and IFRS 9 provisions or macroeconomic/stress scenarios into deal pricing.\nRisk-Based Pricing: What is the deal’s Risk Contribution and Sharpe Ratio, i.e., deal’s impact on portfolio return/risk, taking\naccount of deal’s notional, standalone risk, and correlation with the portfolio?\nLeveraging key metrics from the original portfolio analysis, PortfolioStudio can quickly (within seconds and at the point of\norigination) calculate marginal return and risk statistics, including expected return (or credit earnings), Risk Contribution (RC),\nSharpe Ratio, and incremental portfolio economic capital for new deals. Alternately, given RC for a deal, one can calculate the\npricing required to meet or exceed portfolio Sharpe Ratio or any user-specified hurdle rate. Users can also calculate return/risk\nmeasures by substituting PortfolioStudio’s expected return (numerator) with a user-specified expected return, which should be a\nmarginal measure, in order to remain consistent with Risk Contribution (denominator), which is marginal.\nFigure 14 Risk-based deal pricing via PortfolioStudio.\nSections 2−6 describe how PortfolioStudio can be used to efficiently perform the five key steps to increasing portfolio return/risk.\nSection 7 describes additional PortfolioStudio functionality.\n16 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK7. PortfolioStudio: Additional Functionality\nWhat-If Analysis\nPortfolioStudio’s what-if analysis application allows users to modify inputs, e.g. by scaling or shifting PDs, for certain or all\nsegments in a portfolio and examine the impact on portfolio risk statistics. It provides a convenient way for users to perform\nsensitivity analysis without creating and loading new portfolios.\nFigure 15 What-If analysis inputs.\nFigure 16 What-If analysis results.\nRisk Dashboard\nPortfolioStudio’s Risk Dashboard provides an executive view of all relevant risk measures on one screen. Users can choose from\npre-defined templates with the ability to move, select, or remove items. Clicking any item on the Risk Dashboard launches a\ndetailed view or corresponding module, most of which have been described previously in this document.\n17 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKFigure 17 Risk dashboard.\n18 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKRisk Dashboard (continued)\n19 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKRisk Dashboard (continued)\n20 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKRisk Dashboard (continued)\n21 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKSpread Risk\nPortfolioStudio’s spread-risk module allows for simultaneously modeling of credit risk and spread risk and facilitates spread-risk\ndecomposition.\nFigure 18 Benefits of joint modeling credit risk and spread risk.\nFigure 19 Spread risk decomposition.\n22 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK8. Summary\nInstitutions holding credit portfolios can increase stakeholder value by increasing return/risk, while also ensuring capital adequacy\nand regulatory compliance. This process, for the most part, requires five key steps:\n1. Measuring portfolio risk and ensuring capital adequacy\n2. Quantifying each exposure’s marginal impact on portfolio risk\n3. Setting limits to prevent excessive risk concentrations\n4. Increasing/decreasing credit exposure to increase portfolio return/risk\n5. Pricing and sizing new deals to increase portfolio return/risk\nDesigned with the business user in mind, and as described in this document, Moody’s Analytics PortfolioStudio is an agile efficient\nsolution that helps institutions perform these five key steps and increase portfolio return/risk.\n23 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISKReferences\nBohn, Jeffery and Stephen Kealhofer, “Portfolio Management of Default Risk.” Moody’s KMV Whitepaper, 2001.\nHuang, Jimmy, Mariano Lanfranconi, Nihil Patel, and Libor Pospisil, “Modeling Credit Correlations: An Overview of the Moody’s\nAnalytics GCorr Model.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, 2012.\nKaplin, Andrew, Amnon Levy, Nihil Patel, and Libor Pospisil “Applications of GCorr™ Macro: Risk Integration, Stress Testing, and\nReverse Stress Testing.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, 2014.\nKaplin, Andrew, Amnon Levy, Qiang Meng, and Libor Pospisil “Quantifying Risk Appetite in Limit Setting.” Moody’s Analytics\nWhitepaper, 2015.\nLevy, Amnon, “An Overview of Modeling Credit Portfolios.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, 2013.\nLevy, Amnon, “Nonbank players are ready for CECL — are banks?” American Banker, August 15, 2019.\nLevy, Amnon and Jing Zhang, “Measuring and Managing the Impact of IFRS 9 and CECL Requirements on Dynamics in Allowance,\nEarnings, and Bank Capital.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, 2018.\nLevy, Amnon, Xuan Liang, and Pierre Xu, “Earnings Volatility, Share Price Performance, and Credit Portfolio Management Under\nCECL and IFRS 9.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, 2019.\n24 FEBRUARY 2021 KEY STEPS TO INCREASING CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETURN/RISK© 2021 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
