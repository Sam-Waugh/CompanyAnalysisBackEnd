It is higher when the economy is operating below full employment.\n3 This differs from the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate that the average rate of return on private sector investment is about 10% and that the average return on\nfederal investment is about half that. The difference is largely because the CBO assumes that a significant part of the increased federal spending on infrastructure will\nbe offset by less infrastructure spending by state and local governments. We do not expect this offset to be nearly as large with this infrastructure deal.\n4 A more detailed description of the programs and tax changes in the reconciliation package is available on request.\n5 For more information on the labor force participation rate impacts, a literature review is available in L. J. Bettendorf, E. L. Jongen, and P. Muller, Child Care Subsidies\nand Labour Supply—Evidence From a Large Dutch Reform, Labour Economics (2015).\n6 A description of the Moody’s Analytics model of the U.S. economy is available here. More detailed validation documentation is available on request. The Moody’s Ana-\nlytics model is similar in theory and empirics to those used by the Federal Reserve Board and Congressional Budget Office for forecasting, budgeting and policy analy-\nsis. The model has been used to evaluate the plethora of fiscal and monetary policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n7 The Gini index is a statistical measure of economic inequality. A value of zero represents perfect economic equality, and a value of one represents perfect economic\ninequality. The 2019 Gini index for income in the U.S. was 0.465 and has been steadily rising since the late 1970s, indicating that there has been steady skewing of the\nincome distribution.\n8 Of all the tax increases since World War II, this would rank 24th largest as a percent of GDP.About the Authors\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
