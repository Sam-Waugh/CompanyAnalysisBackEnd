However, a well conducted exercise will add value to your\norganization and provide critical information that helps you identify risks, assess vulnerabilities, design mitigation strategies, and\ndefine realistic capital contingency plans.\n• Identify risks.

Most institu-\ntions go down this path, given the complexity of developing sce-\nnario narratives and projecting multiple dimensions of economic\nvariables. Finally, layer in idiosyncratic loss events and risks to busi-\nness plans to complete your scenario design.\n• Assess vulnerabilities. Well-executed stress testing will expose the institution’s vulnerability to factors that are the direct result\nof the stress and from second-order or knock-on effects. It is not uncommon that loss events that pose stress to capital also evolve\ninto liquidity or credit stress events. This should not be a surprise, given the strong relationship between capital, liquidity and cred-\nit risks. For example, large losses may prevent an affiliate from paying dividends to a parent company that relies on subsidiary divi-\ndends as a key source of funding, and a deteriorating credit environment may prevent the parent from accessing the capital markets.\n2 MAY 2023 Capital Stress Testing: More Than Just a Regulatory Exercise• Define mitigation strategies. Well-executed stress testing informs decision-making. As you review your post-stress capital results\nand consider the range of actions you would take to strengthen your capital position, pull your capital contingency plan. Does the\nplan identify capital triggers? Is the list of actions comprehensive? Are the plans feasible? Is it aligned with capital risk appetite state-\nments approved by your Board? It the answer to any of the questions is “no”, then it is time to revisit your capital contingency plan.\n• Assess capital adequacy. Capital stress testing will help your institution establish internal capital thresholds consistent with\nyour risk appetite. It is also the tool leveraged by regulators in their supervisory stress tests to set capital levels for larger\ninstitutions. Capital requirements effectively impact the level of capital distributions in the form of shareholder dividends or\nshare repurchases.\nHOW CAPITAL STRESS TESTING IS PERFORMED TODAY AND CHALLENGES AHEAD\nCapital stress testing is a complex and highly collaborative process that involves steps, models and business units.\nTypical steps include:\n1.Planning/project management.\n2. Scenario design (macro variables and risk events).\n3. Modeling.\n4. Review and approvals.\n5. Reporting, and if required, regulatory submission.\nThe actual modeling and generating results typically take a third\nof the time allotted to capital stress testing, with one third each\nspent on planning/project management/governance activities,\nand on reporting/reviews/ approvals.\n• Capital stress testing models can be grouped into PPNR and\nloss models, which along with non-model processes, pro-\nduce outputs that are consumed by the next model or pro-\ncess. These models and processes are usually disconnected,\nand data needs to be passed between systems and reconciled.\nCapital projections are the result of balance and income aggre-\ngation processes and are often built in Excel.\n• Business units involved include product lines and corporate functions such as FP&A, Risk, Treasury, ALM, and Regulatory Re-\nporting. Various levels of management committees review and provide effective challenge of assumptions and results.\nTODAY’S CHALLENGES: DISCONNECTED MODELS\nMost institutions deploy their heavy artillery to perform capital stress testing once a year, while they rely on overly simplistic,\nexcel-based approaches for managing capital the rest of the year. For these institutions, capital stress testing is hardly a repeatable\nprocess given the amount of time and effort required from their teams. What makes the process so complicated? The main reason\nis disconnected models.\nDisconnected models presents many challenges, including inconsistencies and process inefficiencies, leading to elevated opera-\ntional risk:\n• Inconsistent assumptions and results. When credit, ALM, and capital models are disconnected, there is a risk that model outputs\nbe inconsistent with each other and with scenario assumptions, requiring additional efforts to reconcile data and results. For\nexample, credit losses may be modeled outside ALM and fed as static loss forecasts that affect the income statement but not\nthe cash-flows, leading to overstated balances and interest income.\n3 MAY 2023 Capital Stress Testing: More Than Just a Regulatory Exercise• Inefficient processes. When models are disconnected, workflows are overly complicated and time is spent in operational tasks,\ninstead of evaluating risks and designing strategies. Making any adjustments require re-performing the process in the various\nsolutions. Reporting can also be challenging when you are pulling capital, balances and income from different systems to find\nthat they do not tie at the end.\n• Model and operational risk. Model governance activities consume an important amount of time in capital stress testing. Insti-\ntutions need to demonstrate to regulators and model risk teams that they maintain effective controls, integrity of the data,\nand sound modeling approaches. Disconnected models may result in control breakdowns and model inconsistencies that may\nimpair the results.\n• High employee turnover. Not frequently mentioned, institutions have traditionally experienced high levels of attrition in their\ncapital stress testing teams. The timeframe to produce stress testing results is compressed between when scenarios are avail-\nable and when results need to be submitted. Inefficient processes take more time and add on to the planning, ALCO and other\nresponsibilities in the teams’ day-to-day jobs, leading to staff attrition.\nAN INTEGRATED ALM MODEL APPROACH TO CST\nMoody’s Analytics offers an integrated, yet flexible capital stress testing MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nECONOMIC SCENARIOS\nsolution that relies on the ALM solution a single interface, where the vari-\nMoody’s Analytics’ economic scenarios\nous components are designed to work together to produce dynamic pro-\nhave become a standard in capital stress\njections of balance sheet, income, and capital that are scenario dependent.\ntesting.

Choose Moody’s Analytics’ off-the-\nshelf economic, growth and credit loss models, for on-de-\nmand capital stress testing.\n• Use as champion model with overlays. Use Moody’s Analyt-\nics’ models as the starting point, and layer in firm-specific or\nidio- syncratic assumptions to account for your unique risks.\n• Use as challenger model. Confirm or challenge your own as-\nsumptions.\nThere are just a few simple steps to execute this integrated approach in Moody’s Analytics ALM:\n1. Configure solution. One-time configuration to assign credit models to portfolios, call report categories to accounts if the\nMoody’s Analytics Call Report Forecast model is used, and report codes and risk weights for capital reporting. Moody’s An-\nalytics onboarding team will help you with this initial configuration step.\n2. Retrieve Moody’s Analytics economic scenarios. This step allows you to import the economic scenario projections directly\ninto the Moody’s Analytics ALM system to create a “forward rate matrix.” No need to store, transfer, and reconcile rate\nforecasts.\n3. Import credit loss assumptions. Choose between Moody’s Analytics bottom-up or top down credit models by instrument\ntype, or import your own credit loss assumptions, as needed. Regardless of the method you select, your cash-flows projec-\ntions are credit-affected and the projected losses flow into income, balance sheet, and capital.\n5 MAY 2023 Capital Stress Testing: More Than Just a Regulatory Exercise4. Import balance sheet growth rate assumptions. Moody’s Analytics’ balance sheet growth rates are from the Call Report Fore-\ncast model and are applied to your base case to generate balance sheet projections for the Moody’s Analytics’ economic\nscenarios. If desired, you can import the assumptions developed by your risk and planning groups instead.\n5. Define and run scenario. Simply select the forward rate matrix corresponding to the economic scenarios you would like to\nrun in your scenario settings.6. Review and report. Run standard reports of balance sheet, income, losses, and capital by scenario.\nBENEFITS OF INTEGRATION\nRegardless of your particular use case, Moody’s Analytics’ integrated framework presents multiple benefits, including model\nconsistency, process efficiencies, and reduced model and operational risk, so you can focus on assessing risks and developing\nmitigation strategies:\n• Consistent assumptions and results. The single framework across ALM, credit loss and capital leverages the same source of data\nand ensures consistency in cash flows, revenue, balances and capital. Reporting becomes greatly simplified because you are\npulling your results from the same framework.\n• Operational efficiencies. Moody’s Analytics’ integrated capital stress testing framework is flexible and smart because you can\nleverage Moody’s Analytics’ comprehensive set of scenarios and assumptions or can select your own, all inside ALM. Run pe-\nriodically on when economic conditions warrant it. Only one interface to learn, fewer dependencies from other model owners\nand a simplified workflow. Time to ditch data transfer and reconciliation processes from disconnected models.\n• Enhanced model governance. With an integrated model and fewer data handoffs you can more easily maintain model docu-\nmentation, demonstrate data lineage and effective controls. Easy to audit, reconcile, validate, and interpret.\n• Engaged teams. Integration means you have a staff that can dedicate more time to assess risks, evaluate and recommend\nstrategies rather than operating the model and reconciling data.\nCONCLUSION\nAs you debrief on this year’s annual capital plan and stress testing, consider that a more efficient process is possible. An integrated\ncapital stress testing framework that is easier on your organization and that can be executed on demand, and not just annually for\nregulatory purposes. Think integrated ALM, credit and capital stress testing with the power of Moody’s Analytics’ macroeconomic\nscenarios: run faster, run smarter, make better decisions.\n7 MAY 2023 Capital Stress Testing: More Than Just a Regulatory Exercise"
