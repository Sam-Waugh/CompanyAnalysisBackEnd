This emphasizes the role of integrating climate scenario analysis in to asset allocation.\nSource: IGCC Navigating climate scenario analysis – a guide for institutional investors1\nClimate-aware Strategic Asset Allocation\nAsset allocation must evolve to incorporate climate-related risks and the impact from any constraints imposed as insurers\ntarget their climate. A top down approach which looks at how climate change related drivers affect returns of asset classes.\nThe analysis should ideally combine a top-down mapping at the macroeconomic level and a bottom-up analysis at the sector\nand company level. Creating an understanding of the risks and opportunities within the existing asset allocation structure and\nthrough evolving the asset mix over time. In a top-down-only analysis, some regional and sectoral impacts might be netted\nout, especially in a diversified portfolio. A combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, although data- and resource-\nintensive, will achieve broad coverage. In addition, the depth of analysis required to make key investment decisions in sectors\nwhere these risks are most material.\n1 Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INCORPORATING CLIMATE RISK IN TO STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION 31. Target Setting\nAs with traditional asset allocation, the process starts with assumption setting. This takes place at both the portfolio level and\nthe asset class level. At the portfolio level, the insurer must set emissions targets, based on science-based pathways such as,\ntemperature-growth target trajectories, aligned to their net zero commitment. Following COP26 we have seen a wave of net\nzero announcements from financial institutions. These company-wide objectives now need to be translated in to more\ngranular metrics for example,% of assets under management (AUM) in net zero assets. In their recent paper2, the UK\nPrudential Regulatory Authority states that “their analysis found significant variation between firms in translating climate\nscience in to targets and scenarios, on modeling climate-related market risk and capital modeling”.\nFor insight in to the types of metric which an insurer may establish, we can look to the regulation in the pensions world, where\nnew climate risk reporting requirements came in to effect for large schemes on 1 October 2021. Trustees must select and\nreport on at least three metrics, including an absolute emissions metric, an emissions intensity metric and one additional\nclimate related metric3. The additional climate change metrics includes a portfolio alignment metric and climate value at risk\n(VaR). The temperature alignment metric compares the implied warming potential of the portfolio to established indices and\nindicates how the portfolio is positioned compared to a particular climate pathway or global warming outcome. The Moody’s\ntemperature alignment data4 assesses the forward-looking trajectory of companies’ emissions. Based on their greenhouse gas\nemissions reduction targets and covers approximately 4,400 large publicly listed companies. The climate VaR provides a\nforward-looking valuation assessment to quantify climate risks and may provide a metric to help adjust the investment\nportfolio to limit exposure to climated-related risks.\n2. Asset Universe\nTo impose Economic Social Governance (ESG) criteria as constraints in the optimization, it is necessary to have ESG\nclassification data, ideally at individual security level. It may be sourced from the external asset manager and the insurer may\nwish to incorporate their own views on top of this. Ideally the ESG classification should explicitly categorize the E, S, and G\nconsiderations. Vigeo Eiris, part of the Moody’s ESG solutions, evaluates the efforts of corporates to pursue a sustainable\nbusiness and attributes a score relative to 38 environmental, social, and governance criteria.\n3. Scenario Analysis\nScenario modeling is an essential component of the framework and the scenarios should consider both the chronic physical\nand transition effects of climate change:\n» Physical risks arise from increasing severity and frequency of climate and weather-related events, such as sea-level rises\nand floods.\n» Transition risks arise from the adjustment towards net-zero emissions, which will require significant structural changes to\nthe economy and technologic advancements.\nScenario analysis is a key feature of insurer’s risk management and, unsurprisingly, features heavily in an insurer’s approach to\nmodeling climate risk. The financial risks posed by climate change are also high on the regulator’s agenda.For example, in the\nUK the Bank of England carries out a biennial stress testing exercise, launched in June 2021. These scenarios built on the\nreference scenarios developed by the Network For Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the set includes three scenarios:\n» Orderly: early, ambitious action to a net zero CO emissions economy\n2\n» Disorderly: action that is late, disruptive, sudden and/or unanticipated\n» Hot house: limited action leads to a hot house world with significant global warming and, as a result, strongly increased\nexposure to physical risks\n2 Climate-related financial risk management and the role of capital requirements, PRA, October 2021\n3 Governance and reporting of climate change risk: guidance for trustees of occupational schemes, DWP, June 2021\n4 For more details, please refer to esg.moodys.io/climate-solutions\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INCORPORATING CLIMATE RISK IN TO STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION 4The Moody’s Analytics Climate Pathway Scenario Service, built on our award-winning scenario generation software, can\ntranslate climate pathways into an insurer’s financial risk variables to help them assess their climate-related risks and\nanticipate the future impact of climate change on asset and liability projections. Climate pathways can be specific to the\nNGFS criteria, Moody’s Analytics economic climate assumptions, or the client’s own input. The climate pathways explore the\nimpact of carbon tax and how these costs get passed through in to different industry sectors. As an example, the chart below\nshows the model’s projection of nominal and real rates under the disorderly transition scenario:\n4. Optimization\nThe investment portfolio optimization will incorporate a third climate dimension, which may be specified as an additional\nobjective or there may be additional constraints introduced. The optimization will aim to satisfy the targets specified in the\nfirst step such as meeting the climate glidepath and targets specified for the allocation to green asset classes and /or ESG\ntilted funds.\n5. Metric analysis\nAfter reviewing the output from the SAA process, the insurer will consider the practicalities of implementation including the\ntransaction costs involved. For example, if significant changes in the sector split of the portfolio are required, then fund\nmandates need to be updated. Where assets are allocated to funds with a specific ESG tilt then benchmark indices will need to\nbe established to monitor performance. If the output proposes investment in new asset classes, then approval for the new\nasset classes will likely be required and the time horizon should allow for the necessary governance.\nIn addition to analyzing the metrics, it is important to understand the narrative such as, why the climate the pathways have\nimpacted the existing portfolio and how the proposed investment strategy meets the objective while still satisfying the\ninsurer’s internal hurdle rate.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INCORPORATING CLIMATE RISK IN TO STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION 5Conclusion\nThe insurance industry has an important role to play in the transition to net zero. Towards the end of 2021, there was\nsignificant momentum behind the transition to a low carbon economy, with many financial institutions announcing their\nplans to become a net zero emissions company. To achieve these plans insurers, now have to align their investment strategy\nwith these targets. Climate scenario analysis is likely to feature heavily in the insurer’s approach to strategic asset allocation,\nand to guide their decision around asset class and sector preferences.\nThis is part of a series of papers on climate risk topics for insurers.
