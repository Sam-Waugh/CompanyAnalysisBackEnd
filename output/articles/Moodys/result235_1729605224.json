    "content": "Liquidity Risk: Elevated Stakeholder Expectations Here to Stay?\nIndustry Challenges\nIn today’s environment, financial institutions are looking for their ALM software to go beyond traditional interest\nrate risk analysis and reporting. Because the ALM model incorporates sophisticated instrument-level cash flow\nmodeling, it is increasingly being relied upon as a critical source of balance sheet management strategy.\nFinancial institutions have been operating under the assumption that non-maturity deposit balances would\nserve as a reliable source of funding. However, unexpected deposit balance outflows contributed to the failure\nof several regional banks in early 2023. Because of this, liquidity management has become an area of renewed\nregulatory focus.\nMany financial institutions utilize Excel for liquidity stress testing. Given the complexity of cash flows associated\nwith loans and deposits, which presents several challenges to forecasting a sufficiently granular and dynamic range\nof scenarios, especially given the renewed regulatory scrutiny around this topic. Performing this function in Excel\nmakes developing and modifying stress scenarios and liquidity waterfall planning tedious and labor-intensive, and\nomits entirely the required level of model governance for a process this significant.\nLeveraging Technology is Critical\nIt is crucial for banks to utilize robust analytical software in their balance sheet management process for many\nreasons:\n1. Accuracy and Efficiency: By harnessing software, banks can swiftly and accurately analyze vast amounts\nof data, enabling them to generate more precise and reliable results for contingency planning and liquidity\nstress testing. Unlike manual processes, software can automate calculations, reducing human error and saving\nvaluable time.\n2. Compliance with Regulatory Requirements: Regulatory authorities mandate that banks have robust\ncontingency funding plans and regularly conduct liquidity stress tests. Utilizing software empowers banks to\nmeet these regulatory requirements effectively and efficiently. It enables them to generate comprehensive\nreports and documentation, providing tangible evidence of compliance.\n3. Scenario Analysis: Software allows banks to simulate various liquidity stress scenarios and assess the impacton their funding sources and liquidity positions. This facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities and\nevaluation of the effectiveness of existing contingency plans. By modeling different scenarios, banks can gain a\ndeeper understanding of potential risks and develop appropriate strategies to mitigate them.\n4. Sensitivity Analysis: Software empowers banks to conduct sensitivity analysis by altering key variables and\nassumptions. This aids in understanding how different factors can influence liquidity positions and funding\nneeds. By analyzing various scenarios and sensitivities, banks can make informed decisions and develop\nstrategies to effectively manage liquidity risks.\n5. Real-time Monitoring: Utilizing software enables banks to monitor their liquidity positions and funding\nsources in real time. This facilitates the prompt identification of any liquidity gaps or potential funding\nshortfalls. Real-time monitoring empowers banks to take proactive measures to address liquidity issues and\nmaintain adequate funding levels.\nMoody’s Analytics ALM Liquidity Stress Testing Module\nMoody’s ALM model offers users a comprehensive liquidity risk management solution that allows users to create\ncustomized liquidity stress scenarios, incorporating both systemic and idiosyncratic risks. Users can also replicate\ntheir contingent funding plan (CFP) using rules, making it easier to modify scenarios and CFPs, and even assess its\neffectiveness across a range of scenarios. The solution generates instrument-level cash flow calculations, providing\na reliable assessment of liquidity gap and enhancing the overall robustness of liquidity risk analysis. Users can\ndevelop custom liquidity stress scenarios based on Moody’s Analytics macroeconomic scenarios or custom\nidiosyncratic scenarios, which can be combined with behavioral assumptions to simulate various liquidity events,\nsuch as increased loan origination, changes in credit line utilization, deposit runoff, loss of funding sources, and\nNIB deposit remixing. Finally, the powerful calculation engine in Moody’s ALM produces granular cash flow results,\nenabling users to evaluate and compare sources and uses of cash under both baseline and stress scenarios.\nApplication\nUse Case: Setting up liquidity stress\ntesting in the ALM US Solution:\n» Step 1: Define scenarios and\nassumptions\nUsers may choose from the built-in Moody’s\nmacroeconomic scenarios, or may develop\ncustom, idiosyncratic scenarios. Additional\nassumptions that may impact liquidity such\nas loan prepayments and funding or deposit\nrunoff may be adjusted at a high level\nhere. Users may also make more targeted\nassumption changes at the account level in\nthe user interface or via Excel\ntemplate upload.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIQUIDITY RISK: ELEVATED STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS HERE TO STAY?» Step 2: Set up balance sheet growth assumptions for each scenario\nGrowth targets can be provided as balances or percentages. The growth scenarios can be input directly into the UI\nor uploaded using Excel templates available within the system.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIQUIDITY RISK: ELEVATED STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS HERE TO STAY?» Step 3: Define the Contingency Funding Plan (CFP)\nThe liquidity module comes with a standard pre-defined contingent funding plan. This can be customized to the\nclient’s individual needs.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS LIQUIDITY RISK: ELEVATED STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS HERE TO STAY?» Step 4: Run and report\nOnce the liquidity run is complete, users can access several pre-defined reports that let them see detailed and\nsummarized views of sources and uses of cash, liquidity gap, and more. These reports can be output as .pdf, .csv,\nor MS Excel files for further customization.\nMoody’s ALM liquidity tools feature a customizable, preset CFP. The liquidity scenarios and other assumptions are\neasily customizable from within the user interface or using simple Excel templates that can be uploaded into the\nsystem. Liquidity runs have a quick turnaround time that allow users to run multiple iterations as needed. Pre-\ndefined reports can be output in multiple formats, including MS Excel.\nConclusion\nToday’s banking environment requires financial institutions to monitor liquidity risk more closely. Moody’s ALM\nprovides a set of tools that allows users to develop a variety of liquidity scenarios to help identify sources of\nliquidity exposure and to develop and test contingency funding plans. Liquidity tools are available in the Moody’s\nALM solution, or as a standalone application.\nwww.\nFor more information about Moody’s Analytics ALM US Solution and related tools, please visit\nhttps://moodysanalytics.com/alm-us\n© 2023 Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates.
