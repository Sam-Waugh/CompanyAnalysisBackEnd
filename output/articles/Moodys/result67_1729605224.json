Unemployment is about as low as it has ever been. The economy is\ncurrently struggling with high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes in\nresponse, but inflation is moderating and should continue to do so as the economic fallout from the\npandemic and Russian War in Ukraine abate. Recent legislation increasing infrastructure investment,\nincenting semiconductor development here at home, and addressing climate change will also support\nthe economy’s long-term growth.\nLawmakers’ most immediate challenge is to increase the federal debt limit. The U.S. Treasury will\nrun out of cash to pay all of the government’s bills on time sometime this summer. The longer it takes\nfor lawmakers to act, the more damage it will do to financial markets and the economy. If they fail to act\nbefore someone is not paid on time, the blow to the economy will be devastating. Lawmakers must also\naddress the nation’s considerable long-term fiscal challenges. Under current law, the nation’s budget\ndeficits and debt load will significantly increase and ultimately become unsustainable. Lawmakers must\nquickly change this outlook through additional revenues and government spending restraint.\nFiscal policy in the pandemic\nThe U.S. economy has recovered quickly from the debilitating COVID-19 pandemic. Three years since\nthe pandemic struck, the U.S. has recovered the GDP lost in the severe recession and the economy has\nreturned to full employment. This strong performance is due in significant part to the quick and massive\nmonetary and fiscal policy response. No other nation responded more aggressively to the pandemic than\nthe U.S. In total, the fiscal support was well over $5 trillion, equal to nearly 25% of GDP (see Table 1).\nThis compares to less than 18% of GDP in the U.K., the country that provided the next most fiscal\nsupport, and the approximately 10% of GDP provided on average by all countries across the globe.Table 1: U.S. Federal Fiscal Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nLegislation Actions $ bil\nCoronavirus Preparedness\nFunding for healthcare agencies and testing, funding for vaccine and other therapies\nand Response Supplemental 8.3\nacross various agencies, subsidized SME loans\nAppropriations Act\nTax credits to firms for COVID-19-related paid sick leave and paid family medical\nleave, food assistance via Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and\nFamilies First Coronavirus\nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, federal 192.0\nResponse Act\nassistance for increased state unemployment insurance benefits, expand Medicare\nand Medicaid coverage to COVID-19 tests\nHousehold cash transfers, federal assistance to expand state unemployment\ninsurance benefits, grant-convertible loans to SMEs under the Paycheck Protection\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nProgram, grants to states and municipalities via $150 bil Coronavirus Relief Fund, 1,756.0\nEconomic Security Act\nstudent loan deferrals, expand Medicaid coverage to telehealth services, various tax\ndeferrals and credits\nPaycheck Protection Addition of $320 bil to Paycheck Protection Program; loans to smaller financial\nProgram and Health Care institutions; grants for hospitals; additional funding for states/municipalities for 484.0\nEnhancement Act COVID-19 testing\nExtension of plus-up to federal unemployment insurance benefits amounting to $300\nper week, with an additional $100 to be provided by states.

André (2005), “Measuring Cyclically-Adjusted Budget Balances for OECD Countries,” OECD\nEconomics Department Working Papers, No. 434, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/787626008442.\nM. Dolls, C. Fuest and A. Peichl (2012), “Automatic stabilizers and economic crisis: U.S. vs. Europe,” Journal of\nPublic Economics, Elsevier, vol. 96(3),\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272711001642.decade ago, when the policy response was slower in coming and much smaller, contributing to what was\na painfully slow economic recovery.2 3\nThe U.S. economy’s rapid recovery was not just due to the scale of the fiscal support by\npolicymakers, but also to how quickly they responded to the pandemic. The pandemic slammed the U.S.\nin February 2020, the massive CARES Act was passed into law in late March, and approximately one\nmonth later more than $1 trillion in fiscal support was already disbursed to households and businesses.\nThere was a similar ramp-up in fiscal support in early 2021, largely via the American Rescue Plan, which\nwas passed into law in March 2021.\nTo assess the contribution of the fiscal policy response to the economy’s performance, the Moody’s\nAnalytics Global Macroeconomic Model is used to construct a counterfactual scenario in which\nlawmakers had not provided economic support to households and businesses during the pandemic. This\ncounterfactual scenario is then compared with a baseline scenario that includes the macroeconomic\nimpact of fiscal policies implemented by lawmakers. There are several simplifying assumptions in this\nanalysis. First, it is assumed that the course of the pandemic and the development and rollout of\nvaccines proceeded as they did. Second, monetary policy is determined endogenously in the model. That\nis, global central banks set interest rate and balance sheet policies based on their reaction functions that\naccount for the economy’s performance, inflation, inflation expectations and financial conditions.4\nFinally, the fiscal measures considered are only those that explicitly address the fallout from the\npandemic.\nIn the counterfactual scenario where this fiscal support was not provided, real GDP falls by a\nstunning 11% in calendar year 2020, more than three times its actual decline. The economy would have\nalso succumbed to a double-dip recession in early 2021 (see Chart 1). A recovery begins in earnest in the\nsecond half of 2021, but even then, the economy never fully returns to its pre-pandemic path, as real\nGDP is permanently reduced.\n2 U.S. discretionary fiscal support during the financial crisis, including the Recovery Act that was passed into law in\nFebruary 2009 and some modest additional support, totaled less than 10% of U.S. GDP.\n3 See “Blinder and Zandi: Policy Responses to Great Recession a Resounding Success,” white paper for Center on\nBudget Policy and Priorities, October 2015.\n4 A central bank’s reaction function is the estimated historical relationship between the bank’s monetary policy\nand the economic, financial and other variables that monetary authorities use to set monetary policy.The impact on the U.S. job market would have been equally grim. The economy is currently on track\nto recoup all of the jobs lost during the pandemic recession by late this year. Without government\nsupport, this milestone would not have been achieved until summer 2026. Low-wage workers, who have\nsuffered most financially during the pandemic, would have been set back even further since they work in\nindustries that have desperately needed government support during the pandemic. Those industries\ninclude administrative and support services, healthcare, retail trade, and leisure and hospitality (see\nChart 2).\nThe weaker job market in the counterfactual scenario means that unemployment remains stuck in the\ndouble digits through 2021, declines only slowly after that, and ultimately never returns to its pre-pandemic full-employment unemployment rate (see Chart 3).5 Moreover, with the economy operating at\nhigh unemployment for an extended period, wage growth sharply slows to an all-time low.6\nIn the counterfactual scenario, inflation picks up in early 2021 as the distribution of vaccines prompts a\nreopening of the economy and a surge in consumer demand. However, it falls back below the Federal\nReserve’s inflation target by the second half of 2022. The Fed is not struggling with uncomfortably high\ninflation as it is now, but with uncomfortably low inflation, as it did in the decade after the financial crisis\n(see Chart 4).\n5 The full-employment unemployment rate, or NAIRU, is estimated to be 3.5%.\n6 Wages as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Cost Index.American Rescue Plan\nArguably the most controversial of the U.S. fiscal support packages was the nearly $2 trillion\nAmerican Rescue Plan that became law in March 2021. The ARP has been criticized as being too large,\noverstimulating an already fast-improving economy and significantly contributing to the currently\nuncomfortably high inflation.\nThis perspective is not consistent with our results. Without the ARP, the U.S. economy would have\ncome close to suffering a double-digit recession in spring 2021. Based on a simulation of our macro\nmodel assuming no ARP, real GDP declines in the second quarter of 2021 and ekes out only a small gain\nin the third. Because of the weakened economy, unemployment rises back over 7% in summer 2021 and\nremains materially higher after that (see Chart 5).7 The ARP is responsible for adding well over 4 million\nmore jobs in 2021, and the economy is currently on track to recover all the jobs lost in the pandemic by\nthe second quarter of this year. If there had been no ARP, it would have taken another year for the\neconomy to recover all of these jobs.\nThe American Rescue Plan did contribute to the acceleration in inflation by supporting increased\nconsumer demand, but this occurred almost entirely in the first half of 2021, when higher inflation was\nnot considered a problem. Indeed, at the time it was thought of as more of an economic benefit since\nthe Federal Reserve had long been struggling to lift inflation. The apex of the ARP’s impact on year-over-\nyear consumer price inflation occurred at the start of 2022, when it added 35 basis points to CPI growth.\nHowever, this boost to inflation has quickly faded, and without the ARP, inflation would have settled back\nto just below the Fed’s inflation target.8\nWhile the American Rescue Plan was costly, if there never had been an ARP, U.S. taxpayers would\nhave ultimately suffered just as much. Because of the weaker economy and automatic fiscal stabilizers,\n7 Due to the much weaker economy, the Federal Reserve keeps the federal funds rate target at the zero lower\nbound and engages in quantitative easing through the end of 2022.\n8 The Fed’s inflation target is 2% for the core consumer expenditure deflator, which, given conceptual and\nmeasurement differences, is consistent with consumer price inflation of well over 2.25%.tax revenues would have been lower and government outlays higher. By the end of this decade, the\nnation’s debt burden would have been equally as large as it will end up being with the ARP (see Chart 6).\nDebt Limit Rabbit Hole9\nThe Treasury debt limit is an immediate threat to the economy and poses a long-term threat to the\nnation’s finances and economic growth. Unless lawmakers increase, suspend or eliminate the limit,\nTreasury will not have the cash to pay all its bills on time later this summer (see Chart 7). Financial\nmarkets and the economy would be hit hard. There is a temptation to brush off the developing debt\nlimit drama by thinking it will end as have similar episodes over the years with lawmakers coming to\nterms and signing legislation just in time. But that thinking seems mistaken given the heightened\ndysfunction in Congress and the large political differences gripping the nation.\n9 A more detailed analysis is provided in “Going Down the Debt Limit Rabbit Hole,” Moody’s Analytics white paper,\nMarch 2023.The Treasury debt limit, which puts a statutory cap on the amount of Treasury debt outstanding and\nthus the ability of the Treasury to issue securities to fund the government’s obligations, was reached on\nJanuary 19. Treasury must now use “extraordinary measures” to come up with the additional cash\nneeded to pay its bills. But those measures are likely to be exhausted by mid-August. Someone will not\nget paid in a timely way. The U.S. government would default on its obligations. A default is defined as\noccurring when the Treasury fails to make any payment obligation on time, regardless of whether it is\nTreasury debt or any other payment that is due.\nA default would be a catastrophic blow to the already-fragile economy. Global financial markets and\nthe economy would be upended. Even if resolved quickly, Americans would likely pay for this default for\ngenerations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been\npoliticized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it.\nTo compensate for this risk, investors will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury securities they\npurchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the\neconomy, diminishing it significantly.\nDebt limit workarounds\nThere is considerable debate over whether the Treasury could prioritize its payments and pay\ninvestors in Treasury securities first to avoid defaulting on its debt obligation. While the Treasury may\nhave the technical ability to pay bond investors before others, as those payments are handled by the\nFedwire payment system while a different computer system handles other government obligations, it is\nunclear whether Treasury is legally able to do so. It would be challenged in the courts. Bond investors,\nunsure of how this legal uncertainty would be resolved, would demand a much higher interest rate in\ncompensation. Moreover, politically it seems unimaginable that bond investors, including many foreign\ninvestors, would get paid ahead of American seniors, the military, or even the federal government’s\nelectric bill for long. Then there is the question of how all the other bills would be prioritized. It is not\npossible for the Treasury to sort through the blizzard of payments due each day. More likely, as outlinedin a report by Treasury’s inspector general, the Treasury would delay all payments until it received\nenough cash to pay a given day's bills.\nTreasury bond investors also know that other often-proposed workarounds to the debt limit, like\nminting a $1 trillion platinum coin, would be unworkable. Federal law does give Treasury the authority\nto mint platinum coins, and the idea is that Treasury would mint a $1 trillion coin, deposit it at the Fed,\nand draw it down to pay the government’s bills. But the law authorizing platinum coins envisaged\ncommemorative coins, and not circumventing Congress’ power of the purse. This would also put the Fed\nin the middle of the battle, badly politicizing the central bank and significantly jeopardizing its\nindependence, which is critical to a well-functioning economy.\nAnother idea is to have Treasury issue premium bonds rather than par bonds as Treasury debt\ncomes due, lowering the face amount of debt outstanding and subject to the debt limit. Of course, the\npresent value of the Treasury’s debt obligation will not have changed, so this is just a budget gimmick,\nbut so too is the debt limit. While this is creative financial engineering, it is not something Treasury\ncould roll out quickly and would be very costly, committing Treasury to higher and higher interest\npayments. It also threatens the well-functioning of the Treasury bond market, the world’s largest and\nmost liquid market. Besides, interest rates likely would still spike as investors view the chicanery as\nputting the nation’s fiscal discipline at risk.\nYet another proposed workaround to the debt limit is to have the president invoke Section 4 of the\n14th Amendment and order the Treasury to keep issuing bonds and paying the government’s bills. The\n14th Amendment states that the “validity of the public debt of the United States…shall not be\nquestioned.” If push comes to shove and lawmakers are about to breach the limit, a 14th Amendment\ndeclaration seems the most viable option, because it highlights the sanctity of the nation’s debt. But\nSection 4 of the 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the Civil War to ensure the federal\ngovernment was not on the hook for the war debt of the Confederate states. Investors would rightly\nwonder if using the amendment to abrogate the debt limit law would stand up in the courts, and if it\ndid, what it means for our political system’s checks and balances. Given the constitutional crisis this\nwould set off, financial markets would still be roiled, and a recession ensue.\nDespite these dark scenarios, financial markets have yet to react to the possibility of a government\ndefault. Of course, the reckoning is still a few months away, and it has become standard practice for\nCongress to run down the clock but in the end figure out a way to raise the debt limit when absolutely\nnecessary.\nEconomic costs of a debt limit breach\nHowever, as the deadline gets closer, global investors will rightly begin to worry that lawmakers will\nerr and fail to act in time. Uncertainty will push interest rates higher and stock prices will fall, slowly at\nfirst but then more quickly. And if policymakers do fail to increase or suspend the limit before the\nTreasury runs out of cash and defaults, interest rates will spike, and stock prices will crater at an\nenormous cost to taxpayers and the economy.\nIf lawmakers are unable to resolve the debt limit in time and the Treasury begins paying its bills late\nand defaults, financial markets would be roiled. A TARP moment seems likely. This harks back to thatdark day in autumn 2008 when Congress initially failed to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout\nof the banking system, and the stock market and other financial markets cratered. A similar new crisis\nwould be ignited, characterized by spiking interest rates and plunging equity prices. Short-term funding\nmarkets essential to the flow of credit that helps finance the economy’s day-to-day activities likely\nwould shut down as well.\nIt is unimaginable that lawmakers would allow things to get to this point, but as the TARP\nexperience highlights, they have done the unimaginable before. Still, if that experience is a guide,\nlawmakers would reverse course within a few days and resolve the impasse to allow the Treasury to\nresume issuing debt again and pay its bills. Much damage already will have been done, and although\nmarkets would right themselves, it would be too late for the already-fragile economy, and a recession\nwould ensue.\nHowever, if lawmakers do not reverse course quickly and the impasse drags on for even a few\nweeks, the hit to the economy would be cataclysmic. Immediately, the federal government would have\nto slash its spending. For example, if the debt limit was breached on October 1 and dragged on all\nmonth, the Treasury would have no choice but to cut government spending by an estimated $125\nbillion. And if there still is no agreement in November, another close to $200 billion in spending would\nneed to be cut. The hit to the economy as these government spending cuts cascade through the\neconomy would be overwhelming.\nAdding to the economic turmoil would be the loss of consumer, business and investor confidence\n(see Chart 8). Political brinkmanship over the operations of the federal government has been frightening\nfor Americans to watch. In both the 2011 and 2013 debt limit episodes, households were closely attuned\nto the political hardball being played in Washington, and consumer sentiment slumped. The\nbrinkmanship is also unnerving for businesses, which will pull back on investment and hiring. And\nfinancial institutions will quickly turn more cautious in extending credit to households and businesses.\nThe timing could not be worse for the economy since many CEOs and economists believed a recession\nlikely this year even before the specter of a debt limit breach. With the Federal Reserve ramping upinterest rates to quell wage and price pressures, avoiding a recession would be difficult even if nothing\nelse went wrong. Most leading indicators of recession, including the prescient policy yield curve—the\ndifference between 10-year Treasury yields and the federal fund rate—point to recession beginning\nlater this year at about the time lawmakers will be doing battle over the limit.\nBased on simulations of the Moody’s Analytics model of the U.S. and global economies, the\neconomic downturn that would ensue would be comparable to that suffered during the global financial\ncrisis. Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and other consumer and corporate borrowing rates would spike\nat least until the debt limit is resolved and Treasury payments resume. Even then, rates would not fall to\nwhere they were previously. And the economy’s long-term growth prospects would be materially\ndiminished.\nWhat’s next\nIt is unclear how lawmakers will resolve the current impasse over the debt limit. Given the severe\neconomic and political costs of a debt limit breach, the most likely path is for lawmakers to come to\nterms just in time to avoid it. This might include an agreement on the debt limit in tandem with an\nagreement on the federal budget for fiscal 2024 that begins on October 1.\nComing to terms after much drama would be consistent with the long, arduous history of\nagreements on the debt limit, and it is fitting given the bipartisan nature of the financial obligations the\ndebt would cover. Both Republicans and Democrats supported the close to $3 trillion in deficit-financed\nfiscal aid provided to the economy to manage through the pandemic under President Trump in 2020.\nAnd while only Democrats supported the almost $2 trillion deficit-financed American Rescue Plan\npassed early in the Biden administration to help with the fallout from the pandemic, only Republicans\nsupported the nearly $2 trillion deficit-financed Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed early in the Trump\nadministration that cut corporate and personal income taxes.\nHaving said this, odds that lawmakers are unable to get it together and avoid a breach of the debt\nlimit appear to be meaningfully greater than zero. The difficulty House Republicans had electing Kevin\nMcCarthy as Speaker, and the terms Speaker McCarthy agreed to in order to win election, including\nhaving a battle over the debt limit with Democrats, does not augur well. Getting any bill through the\nlegislative process is tough under typical circumstances, but getting highly contentious debt limit\nlegislation through this Congress before a breach will be highly problematic.\nAdding to the concern is the growing number of lawmakers openly contemplating whether Treasury\ncould navigate a breach of the debt limit by prioritizing payments to bondholders. They may be earnest\nin questioning whether a breach would lead to turmoil in financial markets and the economy as\ndescribed in this analysis, but they are badly misguided.\nLong-term fiscal challenges\nThe nation’s fiscal situation has significantly improved as the economy has recovered from the\npandemic and the end of the extraordinary support to households and businesses. By the end of\ncalendar year 2022, the federal deficit as a percent of GDP was near its average of the past half century\n(see Chart 9). However, the fiscal situation is set to weaken and under current law will meaningfully\ndeteriorate over the coming decade. That is, if lawmakers make no changes to fiscal policy, theCongressional Budget Office projects that the deficit-to-GDP ratio will increase from 5.2% in fiscal 2022\nto 6.9% by 2033 (see Table 2). The nation’s debt will quickly pile up, as debt held by the public will surge\nfrom 97% of GDP in fiscal 2022 to 118% by 2033. During the past half century, the nation’s debt-to-GDP\nratio has averaged well below 50%.\nTable 2: U.S. Federal Government Budget Outlook\nFiscal yrs\n% of GDP\nAvg $ bil\n1973-2022 2022 2023 2033 2022 2023 2033\nTotal revenues 17.4 19.6 18.3 18.1 4,896 4,812 7,098\nIndividual income tax 8.0 10.5 9.6 9.7 2,632 2,523 3,803\nPayroll tax 6.0 5.9 6.0 5.9 1,484 1,562 2,307\nCorporate income tax 1.8 1.7 1.8 1.4 425 475 539\nOther 1.6 1.4 1.0 1.1 356 251 449\nTotal outlays 21.0 24.8 23.7 24.9 6,208 6,206 9,799\nMandatory outlays 10.9 16.3 14.6 15.3 4,076 3,825 5,997\nSocial Security 4.4 4.8 5.1 6.0 1,213 1,336 2,355\nHealthcare programs 3.3 5.6 5.7 6.7 1,404 1,508 2,629\nMedicare 2.0 2.8 3.1 4.1 710 820 1,623\nMedicaid, CHIP, subsidies 1.2 2.8 2.6 2.6 695 688 1,005\nOther 3.2 5.8 3.7 2.6 1,459 981 1,014\nDiscretionary outlays 8.0 6.6 6.6 6.0 1,657 1,741 2,373\nDefense 4.3 3.0 3.1 2.8 746 800 1,105\nNondefense 3.8 3.6 3.6 3.2 910 941 1,269\nN et int ere st 2.0 1.9 2.4 3.6 475 640 1,429\nDeficit (3.6) (5.2) (5.3) (6.9) (1,312) (1,394) (2,702)\nPrimary deficit (1.5) (3.3) (2.9) (3.2) (837) (755) (1,273)\nDebt held by the public 46.9 97.0 98.0 118.2 24,257 25,716 46,445\nSources: CBO February 2023 Budget Outlook, Moody's AnalyticsThis fiscal outlook is not sustainable. It will ultimately lead to meaningfully higher interest rates\nweighing more and more heavily on business investment, housing, consumer spending, and long-term\nproductivity and economic growth. For every 1-percentage point increase in the federal debt-to-GDP\nratio, 10-year Treasury yields are estimated to increase by approximately 2 basis points.10 The expected\nincrease in the nation’s debt load will thus add an estimated close to 40 basis points to the 10-year\nTreasury yield over the next decade. This will not drive the economy over a cliff, but it will be corrosive\nto the economy’s long-term growth potential.\nThe higher interest rates will also add to the federal government’s borrowing costs and reinforce its\nfiscal problems. According to the CBO, federal interest expense will increase from 1.9% of GDP in fiscal\n2022 to 3.6% by 2033. Consider that the nation will spend about 3% of GDP on national defense over the\nnext decade. In the past, when the interest expense on the national debt rose to more than spending on\ncritical national priorities such as defense, lawmakers acted. The last time they did so was in the early\n1990s, which contributed to the last time the nation enjoyed a budget surplus—in fiscal 2000. It is time\nfor lawmakers to act aggressively again to address the nation’s fiscal challenges.\nAddressing the fiscal challenges\nBoth increased revenues and spending restraint will be needed to address the nation’s fiscal\nchallenges. Most significantly, lawmakers should consider rolling back some of the cuts in the marginal\ncorporate tax rate implemented under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018. The TCJA reduced the rate\nfrom 35% to 21%. Increasing it back to 28% and implementing other reforms, including revising the\nglobal minimum tax regime and limiting inversions, will raise an estimated more than $1.4 trillion in tax\nrevenue over the next decade.11\nAnother proposal would be to increase the Net Investment Income Tax on earned and unearned\nincome above $400,000 from 3.8% to 5%. The NIIT is a tax on qualifying investment income such as\ninterest, dividends, capital gains, rents, royalties, and passive income from businesses not subject to the\ncorporate income tax. This option would also require all pass-through business income of high-income\nhouseholds to be subject to the same rules as other types of income. Together, these tax increases will\ngenerate close to an estimated $650 billion over the coming decade.\nA third proposal would apply the 12.4% payroll tax to earnings over $400,000 in addition to earnings\nbelow the maximum taxable amount under current law. In 2023, all earnings below $160,200—the\ntaxable maximum for that year—would be taxed, as would earnings above $400,000. Earnings between\n$160,200 and $250,000 would not be taxed. The taxable maximum would continue to grow with\naverage wages as under current law, but the $400,000 threshold would not change, so the gap between\nthe two would shrink. The current-law taxable maximum would still be used for calculating benefits, so\nscheduled benefits would not change under this alternative. This option would raise an estimated $550\nbillion in revenues over the coming decade and go a long way to addressing the solvency of the Social\nSecurity trust fund.\n10 This is a Moody’s Analytics estimate consistent with CBO research in “The Effect of Government Debt on Interest\nRates: Working Paper 2019-01,” Gamber and Seliski, March 14, 2019.\n11 A wide range of options to address the nation’s deficits are provided by the CBO in “Options for Reducing the\nDeficit, 2023 to 2032, Volumes 1 and 2,” December 2022.There are sure to be concerns that raising taxes on wealthier households and corporations will have\nserious negative economic consequences. To be sure, all else being equal, higher taxes will weigh on\neconomic growth, but the impact on the economy from the higher proposed taxes will be small. In part,\nthe tax increases being considered on high-income and wealthy households would be the first\nmeaningful tax hike on individuals since the early 1990s. And from a historical perspective they are, on\nnet, modest. Effective tax rates will remain close to historical norms.\nIn a similar way, the proposed tax increases for corporations only partially roll back the large tax cuts\nthey received with the TCJA. The top marginal corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% in the\nTCJA, and we assume in the reconciliation package they would be increased back to 25%. Moreover,\nthere is little evidence to date that the TCJA led to a meaningful sustained increase in business\ninvestment, hiring or wages, or prompted businesses to shift production to the U.S. from overseas as\nintended. While it is difficult to disentangle all that is going on in the economy to isolate the impacts of\nthe TCJA, it is difficult to conclude that the tax cuts in the TCJA have supported a stronger economy. This\nsuggests that partially undoing those tax cuts will not meaningfully hurt the economy.\nLawmakers should also consider policy steps to slow the growth in government spending. Given that\ndiscretionary defense and nondefense spending has already grown more slowly than GDP in recent\nyears and will continue to do so under current law, this does not appear to be a good candidate for\nfurther reductions in spending: neither does reducing mandatory Social Security and healthcare benefits\nper beneficiary. Given the ongoing aging of the population and the increasing numbers of Americans\nreceiving retirement and healthcare benefits, this leaves efforts to reduce the growth in healthcare costs\nas the most viable way to restrain government spending. One proposal would be to build on the\nMedicare drug reforms enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices\nfor more drugs earlier and to extend the inflation rebate rule for drug companies to commercial health\ninsurance. Together these steps would save $200 billion over the next decade and would extend the life\nof Medicare and reduce Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket drug costs. But more broadly, lawmakers\nwill need to take up efforts again to accelerate improvements in the efficiency of the nation’s healthcare\nsystem.\nConclusions\nThe aggressive fiscal policy response to the pandemic deserves significant credit for limiting the\nseverity and length of the recession that occurred when the pandemic struck, and for the subsequently\nstrong economic recovery. There has been criticism of policymakers for going overboard on the fiscal\nsupport, with critics pointing to the currently high inflation and bigger government deficits and debt\nloads. Yet even without the fiscal support inflation would be a worry—not because inflation would have\nbeen too high, but because inflation would be too low, as it had been since the financial crisis.\nFurther, our fiscal situation would have already been even worse if policymakers had not provided\nthe fiscal support, since a much weakened economy would have caused tax revenues to plummet and\ngovernment expenditures to automatically increase. It is thus misguided to second-guess the aggressive\nfiscal policy response during the pandemic. Policymakers had no choice but to act quickly and massively.\nPerhaps in hindsight some of the specific policy steps taken during the crisis could have been better\ndesigned. However, policymakers’ decisiveness in pushing forward with substantial government support\nwas an economic game changer.Policymakers must quickly confront the Treasury debt limit and increase it before the Treasury runs\nout of cash this summer. That the U.S. government is “money good,” meaning it pays the government’s\nbills on time, is a bedrock of the U.S. economy and global financial system. Alexander Hamilton, the\nnation’s first Treasury secretary, established this principal at the founding of the nation when he agreed\nto pay Revolutionary War bond investors at 100 cents on the dollar. This despite that the bonds were\ntrading at pennies on the dollar because few believed the new American government would make good\non its debts.\nWhen the government did make good, it established the sound credit of the U.S., ensuring that we\nare the global safe haven. Hamilton’s action said that when times are tough, even here at home, capital\nstill flows, keeping interest rates down and paving the way for the U.S. dollar to become the global\neconomy’s reserve currency. The economic benefits over the generations are incalculable. Lawmakers\nmust put a quick end to their wrangling over the debt limit so future generations can enjoy the same\nbenefits.\nLawmakers must also quickly address the nation’s daunting long-term fiscal challenges. At the very\nleast, any new tax or spending proposals must be fully paid for. That is, legislation that reduces taxes or\nreduces spending relative to current law, must be paid for through other tax increases or spending cuts.\nBut even if policymakers can achieve this, the nation’s deficits and debt load will continue to mount,\nultimately becoming unsustainable as interest rates rise and economic growth slows, further\nexacerbating our fiscal problems. Both increased revenues and spending restraint will be needed to\naddress them. This will not be easy, but if history is a reasonable guide, lawmakers will be up to the\nchallenge, and they will come through."
