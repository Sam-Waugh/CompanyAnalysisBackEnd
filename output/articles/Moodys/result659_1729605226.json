A speedy implementation will also contribute to a\nbank’s competitiveness by delivering better management insight into the business, allowing it to take advantage of\nfuture opportunities.\nAlthough implementing Basel III will only be an evolutionary step for many organizations, the impact of Basel III on\nbanks and the banking sector should not be underestimated, because it will drive significant challenges that need to be\nunderstood and addressed. For every bank, working out the most cost-effective model for implementing Basel III will be a\ncritical issue.\n3 iMplEMEnting BAsEl iii: chAllEngEs, OptiOns & OppOrtunitiEs2M9O AOpDrYil’ S2 0A0N9AlYTiCS EntErprisE risk solutions\nThe Main Challenges of Basel III\n1. A new risk and Finance Management culture\nBasel III is changing the way that banks address the management of risk and finance. The new regime seeks much greater\nintegration of the finance and risk management functions. This will probably drive the convergence of the responsibilities\nof CFOs and CROs in delivering the strategic objectives of the business. However, the adoption of a more rigorous\nregulatory stance might be hampered by a reliance on multiple data silos and by a separation of powers between those\nwho are responsible for finance and those who manage risk. The new emphasis on risk management that is inherent in\nBasel III requires the introduction or evolution of a risk management framework that is as robust as the existing finance\nmanagement infrastructures. As well as being a regulatory regime, Basel III in many ways provides a framework for true\nenterprise risk management, which involves covering all risks to the business.\n2. Managing Basel iii: different geographies, different issues\nDifferent regions and countries face different challenges in applying Basel III. The EU has been consistent in its adoption\nof past Bank of International Settlements (BIS) regulations and therefore will hope to seamlessly migrate from Basel II\nto Basel III. The EU plans to deliver a unified set of rules across Europe, to discourage ‘gold plating’, and ensure that there\nis a level playing field, removing scope for regulatory arbitrage. The US effectively skipped Basel II, so it will be making a\nfresh start, building on the foundations of Basel I, facilitated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The extent to which other countries\nin the world have adopted one iteration or another varies considerably: Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia are\nwell advanced, on a par with the EU. The picture in Russia and countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and\nAsia Pacific is less clear. Some might choose to start with a clean sheet and implement the full set of rules. Others might\nopt to use Basel III merely as a direction of travel, without embracing the full package. For example, Russia recently\nannounced that it will move from the standardised approach to calculating credit risk, to the internal ratings based (IRB)\napproach by 2015. Some Middle Eastern countries are currently in the process of moving towards the IRB model.\nSome countries might also have other regulatory legacies, which in some cases might mean that some national\nregulations will be superseded by Basel III but might need to be maintained in parallel. Some might choose to adopt\nthe Basel III requirements in their own way, gold-plating the requirements if they feel that Basel III does not meet a\nparticular country’s requirement. This could create idiosyncratic requirements and processes that need to be addressed\nduring implementation.\nRussia\nimplementing Basel ii\nirB in 2015.\nNorth America\nEurope\nUSA, canada and\neU implementing Basel\nmexico implementing\nBasel iii in 2013. iii in 2013, in line with Japan\ncrD 4.

This allows regulators to have a consistent\nframework to compare all the banks they regulate, regardless of whether the banks themselves use the IRB or\nstandardized models. In Europe, for banks using IRB, regulators stipulate that this Basel I ‘floor’ must be in the region of\n80-90% of the calculation using the more costly standardized approach. In the US, the floor is 100%.\nThis may actually mean that banks have to handle compliance across a mix of Basel I, II and III, depending on where they\ndo business and the demands of the local regulators. The reports will need to convey a consistent message so as not to\nmislead the regulator and the market.\nOrganizations with a fragmented data model will be burdened with additional cost and overhead compared to those\nwith a more centralized approach to collecting, consolidating and submitting reports under Basel I, II and III.\nThis diverse picture needs to be considered carefully when applying the principles of Basel III to a bank and implementing\na solution.\n3. Managing the data\nTo deliver compliance against Basel III, all banks must now ensure that risk and finance teams have quick and easy access\nto centralized, clean, and accurate data. This data must reflect their bank’s credit, market, concentration, operational,\nimpairment, and liquidity risk. All banks will also need to calculate the enhanced capital, new liquidity ratios, and new\nleverage ratios to be in a position to start reporting to local supervisors—in the multiple formats that the various national\nregulators require—starting as early as 2013.\nThe data management requirements of Basel III are significant. For the bank, the regulator, and the wider market to get\nan accurate picture of the bank’s position, the data must be accurate, up to date, and consistent. Delivering this cost\neffectively is difficult if the data is dispersed across different silos. Furthermore, the data must be carefully defined and\nmanaged to ensure that it delivers the correct ratio calculations for capital adequacy, leverage, and liquidity every time.\nThis requirement, combined with the significantly greater reporting requirements of Basel III—in terms of granularity and\nfrequency—means that the effort required to manage data within Basel III is greater than ever.\nEnsuring that a bank’s regulatory data is of the right quality and in the right place at the right time is probably the single\nmost important criterion in deciding whether a bank’s Basel III project meets its objectives or not.\n4. Auditing the data\nOnce a regulatory report has been submitted, it is highly likely that a regulator will follow up with the bank to clarify\ncritical issues about how the results were calculated and how the rules were applied. This will require the bank to identify,\ncheck, approve and submit the data, quickly and accurately.\nThese extra submissions need to be consistent with the rest of the report, be delivered in the same format and must be\ncompleted as cost effectively as possible, without impacting other business activities.\nThis audit process will be especially difficult for banks whose data is dispersed across multiple silos and systems, as it will\ntake longer to search for the relevant information. Banks with a centralized data model will be able to respond faster and\nmore efficiently to these enquiries, further streamlining their compliance and reporting processes.\n5. stress testing\nStress testing—the ability to understand the impact of significant market events on the key ratios—receives greater\nsignificance under Basel III.\nStress testing will be required more often, performed across more data, and delivered in more depth. This will be difficult\nto deliver if organizations have their data distributed across multiple silos. It will take longer, it will require more effort,\nand it will deliver less accurate results, compared with having a data model where all the critical information is held in a\ncentral repository.\nPlacing all the data in a central repository will allow banks to run a wide array of complex stress tests that meet the\nneeds of the business - to deliver insight and also meet the needs of the regulator - to deliver compliance.\n5 iMplEMEnting BAsEl iii: chAllEngEs, OptiOns & OppOrtunitiEs2M9O AOpDrYil’ S2 0A0N9AlYTiCS EntErprisE risk solutions\n6. taking an integrated Approach\nThe Basel III regulations reflect the integrated nature of banks and banking. A Basel III management solution must enable\nthe demands of integration; otherwise, compliance will create significantly greater overhead than necessary.\nGiven the way that banks have grown, developed new services (and the systems to support them), and merged\nactivities, it will be challenging to deliver a truly integrated system without disrupting the business of the bank. The ideal\nmanagement solution would consolidate, calculate, and report the organization’s capital, liquidity, and leverage ratios\nfrom a single, centralized reporting platform. It would seamlessly integrate with other source systems and have strong\ndata quality checking and storage capabilities.\nThis approach would streamline the process, allowing risk managers to focus their attention toward primary risk\nmanagement activities rather than the time-consuming data extraction, quality, and reporting issues. Fast calculation\nengines would facilitate weekly and even daily calculations and would feed integrated and comprehensive regulatory\nreporting that is mapped to the local supervisors’ exact requirements, and provide additional business insight for\nthe bank.\nDelivering against this ideal would be demanding for any bank. When this issue is understood in the context of the other\nissues highlighted above, it is clear why it is all too easy to underestimate the challenges of implementing Basel III.\nNevertheless, when these issues are understood in the context of the way a bank is organized, it is possible to conceive a\nsolution that allows a bank to implement the regulations on time and on budget, given the right approach and toolset.\nImplementing Basel III\nMultiple Approaches—One destination\nImplementing Basel III creates a unique set of challenges for every organization, regardless of the organization’s starting\npoint. Because Basel III is more a set of principles than a minutely detailed set of rules, there is no cut-and-dried solution\nwhen implementing it. This flexibility allows banks a great deal of latitude in how they adopt the requirements.\nTwo basic approaches are open to banks that are implementing the regulations. Which approach is the most suitable for\neach organization will depend on the stability and performance of the organization’s current environment and the speed\nat which the organization wishes to implement the regulations, as well as what resources are available.\ni. Enhancing the current Environment\nIn some cases, the best option will be to upgrade the existing environment to the necessary standard by adding\nadditional modules to handle additional requirements, whether it be leverage and liquidity management, stress testing,\ndata warehousing, or reporting.\nEnhancing or upgrading the current environment allows an organization to adopt the regulations at a pace that the\norganization can tolerate and that is less disruptive to business operations. This means that the implementation could be\nless costly to the business, because in many ways it is easier to map the regulatory environment to the business than to\nshape the business around the regulations. This approach allows banks to capitalize on their existing investment, and for\nsome organizations it might be the least costly and least disruptive approach to complying.\nThe key issue here is that a bank must have a very clear idea of how its environment is configured. This can be a\nsignificantly greater challenge than one might realize, especially if a regulatory system has been in place for some time\nand where there have been significant changes in the business.\nAfter the current environment is defined, a gap analysis will identify where the main compliance effort needs to\nbe focused.\nii. deploying a new regulatory Environment\nFor other organizations, the most cost-effective option will be to replace their existing regulatory model with a new,\npurpose-built solution that delivers Basel III “out of the box”—without needing extensive customization.\nAlthough this might appear to be the most costly and disruptive solution, in some ways it might be the most cost\neffective, because it allows the organization to map itself onto the regulations, embedding Basel III within its processes.\nThis approach could conceivably lower the lifetime costs of Basel III to a bank, if the regulations form part of the bank’s\ncorporate modus operandi.\nThe key to a successful deployment is defining the optimal architecture for managing Basel III, and then defining the\nco-existence and migration strategy from the existing environment. It might be possible to take a modular approach\nto migration—moving specific systems to the new environment one by one—which would reduce the risks that are\ninvolved in taking this approach.\n6 iMplEMEnting BAsEl iii: chAllEngEs, OptiOns & OppOrtunitiEs2M9O AOpDrYil’ S2 0A0N9AlYTiCS EntErprisE risk solutions\nuse of Automation\nAn additional consideration—whichever of the preceding options a bank selects—is the extent to which the new\nenvironment should encompass the use of automation. Many banks still make use of manual processes, to a lesser or\ngreater extent, in managing their regulatory compliance.\nThe greater workload of Basel III will make it difficult, if not impossible, for a bank to justify the greater overhead of\nmanual processes, compared to that of automation. The increased regulatory overhead, together with the greater scale\nand scope of banking operations, will make it harder to justify the continued use of manual processes, which can be\ntime consuming, expensive, and prone to human error.\nApproach Advantages Considerations\nEnhancing • Less disruption • Ensure that there are no functional gaps in\nthe platform\nthe current • Quick to value\n• Ensure that the integration between\n• Deliver Basel III at your own pace\ninfrastructure\napplications is seamless\n• Map Basel III directly onto your organization\n• Clearly understand the regulations and how\nclosely your environment meets them\ndeploying a • Clean slate – get the right solution from • How do you implement the new\nthe beginning environment in parallel to the existing\nnew regulatory\nenvironment?

They will\nsee rapid implementation and adoption as providing customers, shareholders, and regulators with the reassurance that\nthey are taking positive steps to put capital in place, to improve their liquidity positions, and to manage risk better.\nEarly adopters will be able to use their stance to differentiate themselves from competitors. Others might take a more\nmeasured approach, aware that the deadline for full implementation is a (seemingly) distant 2019.\nA further consideration about choosing the right model is what will happen after Basel III is widely implemented. At best,\nBasel III will require adjustments so that over time it evolves into Basel IV, Basel V, and so on, as the BIS seeks to resolve\nthe theory of Basel III and its real-world use (as happened under Basel I and Basel II). Regulators are already thinking\nabout a fundamental review of market risk and trading book rules that could be the starting point for Basel IV.\nAn integrated Approach\nRegardless of the approach that organizations take, the solution that they deliver needs to be completely integrated, so\nthat it fully reflects the structure of the regulations themselves.\nThe ideal solution would consolidate, calculate, test, and report an organization’s capital and liquidity risk from a single\nplatform. It would seamlessly integrate with other source systems, and it would have strong data quality checking\nand storage capabilities. Fast calculation engines would facilitate weekly and even daily calculations and would feed\nintegrated and comprehensive regulatory reporting that is mapped to the local supervisors’ exact requirements.\nImplementing all this would streamline the process, allowing risk managers to focus their attention toward primary\nrisk management activities rather than the time-consuming data extraction, quality, and reporting. This approach is\nillustrated in Figure 4.\n7 iMplEMEnting BAsEl iii: chAllEngEs, OptiOns & OppOrtunitiEs2M9O AOpDrYil’ S2 0A0N9AlYTiCS EntErprisE risk solutions\nCalculations\nExternal\nData Source Regulatory Reporting\nBasel I\nBasel II\n» Credit Risk Basel III\n» Market Risk\n» Liquidity Risk\nExternal » Concentration Risk Reporting Engine\nData Source » Operational Risk\n» Expected Loss\nProvisioning\nBusiness\nData Repository Reporting\nEnd\nUsers\nStress Testing\nFigure 4 Basel iii: A Flexible management Framework\nThe central data repository houses the critical risk data that is required for Basel III compliance. It should be able to\ncollect data, providing the complete enterprise-wide regulatory risk picture. End users—including line of business and\ncorporate risk managers, finance teams, compliance staff, and analysts—also need to leverage the system.\nThis consolidated approach means that it is much easier to calculate and store the critical capital adequacy, liquidity, and\nleverage ratios that underpin the Basel III framework. It also means that stress testing can be delivered using the same\ncoherent, integrated dataset.\nThe final stage is to deliver the critical reports both to the business and to the regulator. This task will be significantly\nmore onerous under Basel III. Pillar 1 reports, which cover capital adequacy, need to be delivered in the right format to\nthe relevant national regulators. Pillar 3 reports, which cover similar but not identical ground, need to be created for the\nregulator and for the wider market stakeholders in the interests of market transparency and confidence. Any subsequent\nrequests for additional information from the regulator can easily be accommodated using this consolidated approach.\nThe business also needs to receive management reports, often daily, to understand how the business is performing\nagainst its commercial objectives and to provide the essential business insight that makes Basel III an opportunity as\nmuch as an overhead.\nAchieving this with data that is distributed across multiple silos is much more difficult, more prone to error, and\nmore time consuming. A consolidated, integrated, yet open data repository is the only way to deliver true enterprise\nrisk management.\nBuy or Build?\nAnother aspect of deploying a system for Basel III is the choice of whether to develop a system in house or to buy from\na vendor.\nBeyond perhaps yielding greater insight into the business, developing an in-house solution delivers little competitive\nadvantage. The regulatory requirements are fundamentally the same for all banks. Moreover, the regulations are subject\nto change on a regular basis all over the world. Managing this change is an essential but onerous task. Software vendors\nmaintain teams to analyze and accommodate these changes, which is uneconomic for banks to do themselves. The\ncost of maintaining this regulatory currency is easier for vendors to bear, especially considering the cost of a bank not\nunderstanding the changes to regulations.\nleveraging Basel iii Beyond regulatory capital\nWhile banks have no choice in complying with Basel III, how they choose to implement it can offer scope for competitive\nadvantage. Those banks that implement Basel III with a view to improving their business processes as well as their\nregulatory processes stand to reap further rewards compared to those banks that see Basel III compliance as an end\nin itself.\n8 iMplEMEnting BAsEl iii: chAllEngEs, OptiOns & OppOrtunitiEs2M9O AOpDrYil’ S2 0A0N9AlYTiCS EntErprisE risk solutions\nWhile having a consolidated data set will help streamline the regulatory process, it also allows, potentially for the first\ntime, business managers to have a complete, seamless and consolidated picture of the business. The ability to see the\nconsolidated high-level picture and at the same time drill down into the detail will allow business managers to make\ntimely and informed decisions, based on stronger insight.\nIn addition, having a centralized data model can allow senior management to exert greater management control over\ntheir business. For example it can help enforce more effective limit setting, ensuring that when originating new loans,\nthe bank is not exposed to excessive risks from one customer. Alternatively the centralized data model can help a bank\nimprove the way it manages its asset liability management by providing a complete, flawless picture of a bank’s assets\nand liabilities, allowing it to manage its risks more effectively and profitably.\nRe-using the regulatory data, in different contexts, allows the bank to improve the way it manages the business, helping\nto improve its overall enterprise risk management, growth and profitability.\nConclusion\nBasel III is an opportunity as well as a challenge for banks. It can provide a solid foundation for the next developments\nin the banking sector, and it can ensure that past excesses are avoided.\nThe key to ensuring that Basel III is an opportunity for banks is the selection of the technology architecture that is used\nto deliver the framework. This technology architecture needs to accommodate the scale and structure, the processes,\nand the geographic spread of the bank and blend all these seamlessly into the scale and scope of the regulations.\nThe solution needs to be flexible, to fit the needs of the bank, and sufficiently open to accommodate changes to the\nbusiness and the regulations.\nThe complexity and demands of Basel III and the commercial demands of the banking world will require a flexible Basel\nIII management solution that delivers speed, accuracy, and performance to deliver competitive advantage. And those\nbanks that implement the optimal solution will not only have an ideal platform for delivering Basel III, they will also\nhave a solid platform for their future commercial development.\n9 iMplEMEnting BAsEl iii: chAllEngEs, OptiOns & OppOrtunitiEs2M9O AOpDrYil’ S2 0A0N9AlYTiCS EntErprisE risk solutions\nAbout Moody’s Analytics RiskAuthority\nRiskAuthority calculates, consolidates, and reports your organization’s Basel III regulatory credit risk, market risk,\noperational risk, concentration risk, and liquidity risk.
