While there was strong uniformity of views regarding the factors behind the sup-\nply shortage, there were meaningful disparities in the ordering of the importance of these factors. So, we did a statistical analysis to assess\nthe relative impact of the factors.\nOur statistical analysis confirmed that the factors identified in these conversations were indeed important, and that land availability\n(proxied by the land share of house prices) is the most critical factor explaining the shortage followed closely by the availability of financing\n(proxied by the Federal Reserve’s senior loan officer survey results for acquisition development and construction loan underwriting stan-\ndards). Labor (measured by annual pay from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages) and material costs (which we proxy for with\nthe producer price index for softwood lumber) are somewhat less important, with their relative importance depending on market condi-\ntions. Labor was more important prior to the pandemic because of the extraordinarily tight job market, and material costs have become\nmore important during the pandemic because of the supply chain disruptions and ongoing trade conflicts.\nThe statistical analysis includes the simple correlation of the various factors with the difference between the housing vacancy rate and\nthe average of the vacancy rate over the period for which historical data are available, or vacancy gap, across metro areas. The average\nvacancy rate is a proxy for the equilibrium vacancy rate, or that vacancy consistent with house prices and rents growing at the pace of\nhousehold incomes and construction costs. Each of the factors is meaningfully negatively correlated with the vacancy rate, though the cor-\nrelation coefficients for labor and lumber are lower than for the land share and AD&C underwriting standards (see Table 1).\nWe also performed univariate (each factor is regressed separately on the vacancy gap) panel regressions across metro areas over the\nperiod for which historical data are available. The coefficients are interpreted as the change in the vacancy gap for a given one standard de-\nviation change in the factor. Land availability and financing stand out as very important factors explaining the housing shortage—labor and\nlumber costs much less so.\nFinally, we ran a multivariate (all the factors are regressed collectively on the vacancy gap) panel regression across metro areas over\nthe period for which historical data are available. All the factors are appropriately signed and statistically significant, although land share\nstands out. A one standard deviation increase in the land share increases construction enough to reduce the vacancy gap by 2.5 percentage\npoints. This suggests much of the housing shortage that has developed since the financial crisis is due to land constraints. Labor costs are\nthe least important factor driving the vacancy rate in the multivariate regression, though this may reflect the soft job market in the years\nimmediately after the financial crisis.\nTable 1: What Explains the Housing Shortage?\nExplaining the vacancy gap – the difference between the actual and equilibrium housing vacancy rate\nCorrelation Univariate panel regressions Multivariate panel regression\nCoefficient Coefficient T-statistic Coefficient T-statistic\nLand share of house price -0.08 -0.50 -12.9 -2.52 -15.9\nAD&C loan standards -0.20 -0.38 -25.7 -0.40 -12.0\nConstruction labor compensation growth -0.05 -0.04 -1.6 -0.02 -0.8\nLumber price growth -0.05 -0.07 -4.1 -0.18 -7.1\nNotes:\nCorrelations based on metro area data over the available historical period.\nRegressions are panel regressions for metro areas and census divisions over the available historical period.\nCoefficients on the explanatory variables represent the change in the vacancy rate gap for a 1 standard deviation in the explanatory variable\nSources: Engineering News Record, FHFA, CoreLogic, BLS, Federal Reserve, CoreLogic, Moody’s Analytics\nOVERCOMING THE NATION’S DAUNTING HOUSING SUPPLY SHORTAGE 3Overcoming the Nation’s Daunting Housing Supply Shortage\nChart 5: Construction Financing Still Tight Chart 6: Land Costs Soar\nConstruction and land development loans, % of total loans Land share of house price, %\n10 80\n75 2012 2020\n9\n70\n8 65\n60\n7\n55\n6 50\n45\n5 40\n4 35\n30\n3 25\n2 20\n80 85 90 95 00 05 10 15 20 U.S. Atlanta Baltimore ChicagoPittsburgh Seattle San Fran.\nSources: FDIC, Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics Sources: CoreLogic, Engineering News Record, Moody’s Analytics\nMarch 2021 5 March 2021 6\ncrisis and show little signs of expanding them again.

While this is only one of the tools we recommend policymakers use to address the housing shortage, it is\nrepresentative of the economic benefits.\nOur simulation is based on several assumptions, including that the legislation becomes law later this year and is effective in calendar\nyear 2022. Given the magnitude of the increase in funding, we assume it will take several years to get a program or mix of programs like\nthis up to full speed. Even if policymakers leverage existing programs, it will take time to expand the needed infrastructure to disburse this\namount of funding effectively.\nAnother important assumption is that it will cost close to $200,000 to produce a typical affordable housing unit in 2022. This is consis-\ntent with the cost to produce a unit in a Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project. We expect that cost to increase by over 3% per annum,\ngiven the strong economy and higher tariffs on imported homebuilding materials, and to moderate closer to 2% growth by the mid-2020s,\nconsistent with overall price inflation.\nFinally, we make the highly stylized assumption that the program is largely paid for with higher estate taxes and is thus deficit neutral\non a dynamic basis with no resulting impact on interest rates.\nUnder the new legislation, our model shows that affordable housing construction increases by 275,000 units per annum over the 10-\nyear budget horizon (see Table 3). This would alleviate the affordable housing shortage by the second half of this decade. Since housing sup-\nply is significantly increased, it will have the added benefit of improving housing affordability particularly for affordable rental homes. With-\nout the legislation, rents are expected to increase by over 4% per annum. With the legislation, rent growth will be closer to 3% per annum.\nA decade from now, affordable rents will be approximately 10% lower than they are today, or about $100 per month in today’s dollars.\nMore housing construction will increase the economy’s growth rate and the number of jobs as activity increases. The increased housing con-\nstruction will lift employment by approximately 250,000 jobs in 2022 and by just over 400,000 jobs at the peak of the impact in the mid-2020s.\nThere are a range of other factors that we did not consider, but whose macroeconomic impacts likely offset each other. We understate\nthe economic benefit of the legislation, because it does not consider that the measure will facilitate the ability of low-income households\nto move closer to their employment or potential jobs. Affordability is also forcing low-income workers to live farther away from their work,\nrequiring long and costly commutes and reducing productivity. There is also the possibility the program is not fully paid for, which would\nadd to the nation’s deficits, resulting in higher interest rates that would limit the benefits to the economy.\nTable 3: Macroeconomic Impact of Federal Programs Promoting Housing Supply\nAnnual spending, $ bil Additional affordable housing units\nHousing Capital Housing Capital\nTrust Fund Magnet Fund Total Trust Fund Magnet Fund Total Additional jobs\n2022 34.5 0.4 34.9 170,593 13,845 184,438 249,098\n2023 40.0 0.9 40.9 192,402 30,303 222,705 300,780\n2024 45.0 1.7 46.7 211,173 55,843 267,016 360,625\n2025 46.5 2.5 49.0 213,306 80,276 293,582 396,505\n2026 46.5 3.2 49.7 208,714 102,113 310,827 419,795\n2027 46.5 3.2 49.7 204,421 100,013 304,434 411,160\n2028 46.5 3.2 49.7 200,217 97,955 298,172 402,704\n2029 46.5 3.2 49.7 196,291 96,035 292,326 394,808\n2030 46.5 3.2 49.7 192,442 94,152 286,594 387,066\n2031 46.5 3.2 49.7 188,669 92,306 280,974 379,477\n2022-2031 445.0 25.0 470.0 1,978,226 762,841 2,741,067\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nOVERCOMING THE NATION’S DAUNTING HOUSING SUPPLY SHORTAGE 6Overcoming the Nation’s Daunting Housing Supply Shortage\nEndnotes\n1 Total supply equals new single- and multifamily housing starts and manufactured-home placements, and trend housing demand equals household formations, new\nhomes needed to replace those that become obsolete, and second and vacation homes.

Random Lengths data indicate that softwood lumber prices are up even more,\nfrom $350 to $1,040 per thousand board feet, between April 2020 and March 2021. The National Association of Home Builders estimates this has added $24,000 to the\nprice of a typical home.\n7 This is based on the employment cost index for construction workers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n8 This includes 1-4 family residential construction loans and land development loans from the FDIC.\n9 We estimate land values and the land share of house price across metropolitan areas based on data from the FHFA, CoreLogic, and the Engineering News Record.

The HTF\nprovides funds to state housing authorities for the development of affordable rental units. Housing authorities have flexibility in allocating these funds since each has dif-\nferent objectives and goals based on the needs of the local population. The CMF provides funds to Community Development Financial Institutions and other non-profit\ndevelopers for increasing the supply of affordable housing. CDFIs are mission-driven financial institutions that provide financing for development in underserved commu-\nnities. The HTF and CMF have the flexibility necessary to significantly increase the supply of affordable housing in real estate markets encumbered by a range of complex\nand costly problems.\n11 Typically, in a Municipal Utility District a land developer funds the initial construction of roads, water, sanitary sewer, and drainage infrastructure necessary to complete a\ndevelopment. Tax advantaged bonds are then issued to reimburse the developer for the infrastructure improvements as the development creates taxable value needed to\ncover the debt. Property and ad valorem taxes as well as water, sewer and other utility revenues are used to pay off the bonds, which can take up to 30 years.\n12 Infrastructure districts include Municipal Utility Districts in Texas, Community Development Districts in Florida, Metro Districts in Colorado, and Community Facility\nDistricts in California and Arizona.\nOVERCOMING THE NATION’S DAUNTING HOUSING SUPPLY SHORTAGE 7Overcoming the Nation’s Daunting Housing Supply Shortage\nAbout the Authors\nJim Parrott is a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute and co-owner of Parrott Ryan Advisors, which provides strategic advice on housing finance issues to financial\ninstitutions active in the primary and secondary mortgage market.
