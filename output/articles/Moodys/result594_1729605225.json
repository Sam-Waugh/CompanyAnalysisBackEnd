We considered five asset classes: Mortgage, Cards,\nCommercial & Industrial, Commercial Real Estate, and Commercial Real Estate – Construction,\nfollowing the definitions in the FDIC Call Reports. We define the severity of stress as current\nquarterly charge-offs relative to average quarterly charge-offs for each bank, taken as a measure\nof through-the-cycle losses. Using this same definition of stress, peak stress is the maximum\nseverity of stress in the three years following the start of the Global Financial Crisis (the fourth\nquarter of 2007) and time to peak is the number of quarters that elapsed before reaching this\npeak. The distribution of these results is summarized in Figures 1 and 2.\nThere are substantial differences in the severity of the loss experience of each asset class. Cards\nexperienced the lowest peak stress considering both the mean and median, while CRE and CRE\nConstruction, showed the highest. Perhaps surprisingly, Mortgage stress falls somewhere in the\nmiddle despite being the catalyst for the recession, as shown in Figure 1.\nMAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCEFigure 1 Summary Statistics for Peak Stress1 During the 2007 Recession\nMortgage Cards C&I CRE CRE Construction\nMean 10.9 4.7 6.7 16.9 17.3\nMin 0.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 -61.7\n1st Quartile 4.4 1.7 3.1 4.9 10.2\nMedian 6.9 2.3 5.1 9.7 14.5\n3rd Quartile 12.1 3.4 8.3 16.5 22.3\nMax 69.6 44.5 42.9 676.1 66.7\nFigure 2 gives summary statistics for the time to peak. There is less variation in this measure, as peak stress occurs roughly\ntwo years after the start of the recession for each asset class. Peak stress in C&I occurs slightly earlier than other categories,\nas indicated by the lower mean and median. Note that this variable is bounded by zero and 12 by definition (that is, 12\nquarters from the recession start was the limit in our search for each bank’s peak net charge-off rate associated with the\nGlobal Financial Crisis).\nFigure 2 Summary Statistics for the Time to Peak During the 2007 Recession\nMortgage Cards C&I CRE CRE Construction\nMean 7.4 7.5 6.8 8.1 7.7\nMin 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n1st Quartile 6.0 6.0 4.0 6.0 6.0\nMedian 8.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 8.0\n3rd Quartile 10.0 9.0 9.0 11.0 11.0\nMax 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0\nOf course, the preceding metrics are only part of the story for loss emergence and provide a single point of view anchored\nin the most recent recession on record. This point of view should be supplemented by an analysis that highlights the\ndifferences between where we are today and where we were in the 2007-2010 period, by looking into nontraditional\nelements of the credit cycle. The first 12-15 months of the pandemic recession were different from past economic\ndownturns. Understanding these differences and monitoring their prospective behavior relative to historical experience is\ncritical for managing reserves as economic conditions and credit quality stabilize.\nConsumer behavior\nConsumer behavior is a key driver of the economy and was the focus of much of the fiscal response to the pandemic.\nInterpreting current conditions through a consumer lens applies to retail portfolios, but also provides insights for analysis of\ncommercial portfolios. Reflecting well-established relationships2 between macroeconomic variables and net charge-off\nexperiences, many credit models (consumer and commercial) use unemployment levels as a benchmark for default\nexpectations. For consumer portfolios, unemployment increases directly affect borrowers’ ability to repay. For commercial\nportfolios, increases in unemployment coincide with declines in demand for the goods and services sold by businesses\n(indirectly affecting borrowers’ ability to repay). For reasons we will explore further, predicting the severity and timing of\npeak credit losses from the pandemic requires nuance that is not obvious in commonly evaluated unemployment data.\nFrom this perspective, we consider loss emergence by evaluating the options available to borrowers who are unemployed\nbut want to avoid default:\n1. Seek alternative employment or other income\n2. Curtail monthly expenses\n1 Peak stress is defined at the multiplier of the average through the cycle loss for an asset class; for example, the mean peak loss for Mortgage is 10.9 times the\nthrough-the-cycle average loss on mortgage portfolios for the top 100 banks.\n2 Unemployment increases during periods of economic decline and increases in unemployment are closely followed by increases in default.\n2 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCE3. Unlock equity, liquidate assets, or seek alternative financing\n4. Reduce debt or defer payments\nDifferences between current conditions and the Global Financial Crisis affect the prioritization of these strategies (detailed\nin the following sections), and ultimately, the borrower’s ability to avoid default. These measures help reserve judgments\nand help credit risk managers combine macroeconomic, monetary, and fiscal considerations into meaningful insights for\ntheir own portfolios. Historical data for the indicators included in our analysis are available from the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Historical and\nforecast data at national, regional, and localized levels of aggregation for several of these indicators are available from the\nMoody’s Analytics DataBuffet™ product. See Figure 12 for mnemonic citations. In all charts, US recessions are shaded.\nSeek alternative employment or other income\nVolatility of unemployment levels and availability of alternative sources of disposable income are vital distinctions between\nthe Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic. CECL models reacted quickly to the unemployment spike that began in Q1\n2020 and the sharp recovery in Q3 2020. Current fiscal and monetary responses were faster and larger than the Global\nFinancial Crisis, but it remains unclear if these factors prevented or merely delayed loss emergence. Many businesses closed\npermanently, and structural transitions in several industries were accelerated. Prospective development of job markets and\nmore targeted fiscal support may appear more like previous recessions, but there are several factors to watch to shape loss\nreserve strategy in the meantime.\nRecord levels of unemployment were reached in both the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic, with peaks of 10.0%\nand 14.8% in October 2009 and April 2020, respectively. The unemployment rate was much more volatile during the\npandemic than the Global Financial Crisis; this was an early defining feature of the current recession. Peak unemployment\noccurred nearly two years after the start of the 2009 recession and was slow to recover, not falling below 5% until January\n2016—nearly nine years later. Peak unemployment was reached only two months into the current recession but decreased\nby 50% within 6 months and continues a gradual recovery. Unemployment remained at 6.1% in April 2021.\nFigure 3 Unemployment Rate (%, SA) and Average Weeks Unemployed (SA)\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics\nThe length of time workers remain unemployed is important for evaluating loss emergence as longer periods of\nunemployment are more likely to be permanent and unemployment benefits provide a finite safety net. The influx of\npandemic-related claims is evident in the sharp decline of average weeks unemployed as well as direct measures of initial\nand continuing claims at the start of the recession. Through early 2021 these indicators have returned as signals for\nevaluating the unemployed population as headline unemployment and initial claims have normalized from their Q2 2020\npeaks. Average weeks unemployed reached 29.7 weeks in March 2021, as shown in Figure 3. Of total unemployed, the\npercentage unemployed 27 weeks or more has steadily climbed throughout the current recession and is approaching peaks\nobserved during the Global Financial Crisis. Peak charge-offs for commercial banks coincided with peaks in the percent of\nunemployed who were jobless 27 weeks and over following the Global Financial Crisis (that is, losses emerged as\nunemployed workers exhausted unemployment benefits).\nAs the average length of unemployment continues to expand, changes in benefit availability and the composition of the\nunemployed will be informative for reserve judgments. Temporary layoffs featured much more prominently in the\npandemic than the last two recessions. These occurred as businesses shut down due to social distancing orders, with plans\nto rehire workers once restrictions were lifted. Temporary layoffs have declined as social distancing orders lift, but signs of\nrecovery are elusive in the permanent job loser data depicted in Figure 4.\n3 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCEFigure 4 Unemployment Level – Job Losers on Temporary Layoff (SA) and Permanent Job Losers (SA)\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics\nUnemployment benefit extensions and enhancements provided by the CARES Act and successive legislation factor in the\nmuted impact of extended unemployment on credit experience, but resurgent job markets are also expected as vaccine\nrollout continues and possibly reverses unemployment duration trends. Through the end of April, 44.4% or 147.5 million\nAmericans had received at least one dose, and 31.8% or 105.5 million Americans were fully vaccinated according to CDC\ndata.3 Vaccine eligibility was expanded to include all US adults effective April 19, 2021, with many states opening eligibility\nahead of this deadline.\nFigure 5 Percent of Total Unemployed Jobless 27 Weeks or More (%, SA) and Percent of Total Unemployed on\nTemporary Layoff (%, SA)\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics\nWorkers are typically eligible for up to 26 weeks of benefits from most state-funded unemployment compensation\nprograms (driving the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ measurement of workers unemployed 27 weeks or more). Under the\nCARES Act, all states provided 13 additional weeks of federally funded Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation\n(PEUC) benefits, followed by additional weeks of federally funded benefits in states with high unemployment (up to 20\nweeks depending on state laws). Expanded benefits included an additional $600 per week through July 2020. Also, under\nthe CARES Act, some people who exhausted these benefits and many who lost their jobs but were not normally eligible (for\nexample, self-employed and gig workers) qualified for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Successive legislation in\nDecember 2020 and March 2021 extended unemployment benefits (including assistance for self-employed or gig workers)\nwith a $300 weekly supplement through September 6, 2021. As the social distancing restrictions that drove increases in\ntemporary layoffs are lifted, there is some question whether the enhanced unemployment benefits (or other pandemic-\nrelated factors such as difficulty finding childcare, health concerns, and so on) will make workers reluctant to return to their\njobs. Figure 5 provides two key benchmarks for monitoring this behavior. Reserve managers’ judgments about loss\nemergence should carefully consider the September expiration of pandemic unemployment benefits (or an extension if\nCongress passes additional legislation) and monitor the scale of extended unemployment and permanent job losses that\nexist within their portfolio footprint.\n3 COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States. Retrieved from CDC, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations, May 4, 2021.\n4 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCESeparate from enhanced unemployment benefits, other transfer payments affected the personal income of large segments\nof the population (both employed and unemployed) and enhanced the contrast between the pandemic and previous\nrecessions. In March 2020, the CARES Act provided $300 billion in one-time cash payments to individuals (with most single\nadults receiving $1,200 and $500 per dependent child). The scale and timing of these initial payments are the first obvious\ndifferences between the pandemic and the Global Financial Crisis income data. Additional one-time $600 cash payments\nto individuals were issued in December 2020, followed by $1,400 checks issued in March 2021. The long-term trend of\npersonal income and personal current transfer receipts (which include stimulus and unemployment payments) both exhibit\nthe effect of the fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic as shown in Figure 6. Transfer receipts’ impact to income—that\nis, total income exceeded pre-pandemic trends, despite high levels of unemployment—is meaningful for prospective reserve\njudgments. Future decreases in transfer payments or reversion of income to the longer-term trend could both signal\nincreased risk for borrower default.\nFigure 6 Personal Income and Personal Current Transfer Receipts (SAAR)\nSource: US Bureau of Economic Analysis\nCurtail monthly expenses\nPersonal consumption expenditures (PCEs) are the primary measure of consumer spending for goods and services. Social\ndistancing orders, which both closed or reduced business operations and required consumers to shelter in place, had a\nmaterial impact on PCE at the beginning of the pandemic. With businesses closed and consumers staying home to avoid\ninfection, the opportunity to spend was limited. There was a strong shift to e-commerce, which peaked at 16.2% of total\nretail sales in Q2 2020 and remains above pre-recession levels. Notably, the spending curtailment occurred at the same\ntime as increases in disposable income noted previously. Pent-up demand may offset this savings as restrictions are lifted,\nbut in currently observable data, consumers continued meaningful restraint into early 2021 as shown in Figure 7. Through\nMarch 2021, stimulus money, vaccinations, and business reopenings supported a recovery in consumer spending. The\ntiming, magnitude, and volatility of change relative to the start of the recession are substantially different in the pandemic\nthan were observed during the Global Financial Crisis. Reserve decisions should carefully evaluate the path of future\nconsumption for indications that consumers remain stressed—with social distancing orders lifted, household expense\nmanagement could behave more consistently with past recessions.\nFigure 7 Personal Consumption Expenditures by Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR)\nSource: US Bureau of Economic Analysis\n5 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCEEviction moratoriums at the state and local level were enacted at the start of the pandemic. A national moratorium was\nenacted by executive order in September 2020 and extended through June 2021 by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC). The CDC moratorium was legally challenged and thrown out by a US District Court judge in May 2021,\nupending a relief measure that has protected millions of tenants but created hardships for landlords. The Justice\nDepartment appealed and may seek an emergency stay of the ruling. These developments should be considered carefully as\npart of credit loss expectations. The moratoriums removed the burden of rent from many households since the start of the\npandemic, but also enabled many renters to incur multiple months of unpaid rent. The ruling could make it easier for\nlandlords to evict these tenants or embolden more state and local court systems to stop enforcing the moratoriums. These\nactions could prompt borrowers to prioritize bringing rent current over payment of other debts. The US Census Bureau\nPulse Survey in April 2021 suggested one in seven renters are behind on their payments—roughly three times the typical\nrate. Congress appropriated $25 billion in rent assistance as part of the December COVID-19 aid package, but distribution\nhas so far been stalled by efforts to implement distributions at the state level and prevent fraud.\nUnlock equity, liquidate assets, or seek alternative financing\nIn contrast to the last two recessions, households confronted the current recession with the support of appreciating values\nacross multiple asset classes and wider credit availability. Unlike the Global Financial Crisis where many borrowers found\nthemselves underwater in one or more mortgages, home price appreciation continued throughout the current recession as\nshown in Figure 8. To date, this has significantly limited the strategic default that characterized consumer behavior during\nthe Global Financial Crisis and preserved home equity access at historically low rates (that is, HELOCs and cash-out\nfinancing).\nFigure 8 Households: Total Net Worth and Owners’ Equity in Real Estate (Level, NSA)\nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nFollowing market turmoil in early March 2020, the Federal Reserve took a range of actions (for example, funding facilities,\nlowering benchmark rates, and so on) to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. These actions, combined\nwith fiscal stimulus payments, led to significant growth in new mortgage originations, mortgage refinancing, and retail\ntrading volume (preventing the sustained market selloff observed throughout prior recessions) shown in Figure 9.\nAdditionally, the CARES Act granted greater access to retirement account savings with provisions that waived penalties for\nearly distributions from retirement accounts, increased the maximum loan from 401(k) accounts to 100% of vested assets,\nand allowed a 1-year delay in repayments of outstanding retirement plans.\n6 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCEFigure 9 Households: Assets as a Share of Disposable Personal Income (SAAR)\nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nReserve judgments should monitor regional differences in housing prices that may have idiosyncratic effects on a given\nportfolio not captured in national data. When a household’s largest asset keeps appreciating (along with their brokerage\nand retirement accounts), they retain the flexibility to support debt service. Credit risk managers should carefully monitor\nthe effects these factors have on borrower behavior, and carefully consider how nuanced credit models’ evaluation of these\nfactors relates to the regional exposure of their portfolios.\nReduce debt or defer payments\nBefore the Global Financial Crisis, there was never a year-over-year decline in revolving credit balances as shown in Figure\n10. Balances have dropped a second time during the pandemic, but for very different reasons. Global Financial Crisis\ndeclines reflected significant default closely related to stress in the mortgage market due to declining home prices. To date,\ncharge-off rates on cards and other revolving credit remain historically low. Credit card balances were $105 billion lower in\nMarch 2021 than they were a year earlier—the largest yearly decline observed in available data. Revolving home equity lines\ncontinued a downward trend that has been ongoing since the close of the Global Financial Crisis.\nFigure 10 Consumer Credit Card and Revolving Home Equity Loans Held by US Commercial Banks\nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nBalance declines highlight two present factors that were absent in the Global Financial Crisis: federal support of households\nthrough direct financial transfers and forbearance of mortgage and student loan payments, and limits on consumption\nopportunities due to state and local social distancing orders. Households have deployed the resulting liquidity for debt\nreduction and realize some of the highest levels of personal savings in decades.\n7 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCEFigure 11 Consumer Price Index: Used Cars and Trucks, S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, Bank Prime Rate\nSources: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC\nThe CARES Act established forbearance for federally insured mortgages and federal student loans. Financial regulatory\nagencies used existing authorities to encourage loan forbearance and other relief for consumers. Banks’ strategies for\ndeferrals vary across portfolios, and in composition (for example, principal and interest, principal only, number of payments\ndeferred, number of deferrals issued to a single borrower, and so on). Deferred balances outstanding on bank balance sheets\nhave declined significantly since the start of the pandemic. As these measures will soon expire, bankers must think carefully\nabout the residual risk in their portfolios. Collateral values remain strong and credit is priced affordably (see auto and home\nprices and the prime rate in Figure 11), so outcomes depend on the borrower’s available cash flow to support debt service.\nConclusion\nMuch of the pandemic’s stress was temporary and combined with government support at levels very different from the\nGlobal Financial Crisis. It is likely these conditions blocked some of the losses that would have otherwise been incurred, but\nresidual repricing of credit may still remain in the system given the extent of economic damage and structural changes in\ndemand caused by the pandemic. After many of these interventions (foreclosure/eviction moratoriums, enhanced\nunemployment benefits, and so on) expire in Q2 2021 and Q3 2021, borrower behavior may change again, potentially\nrenewing the value of Global Financial Crisis benchmarks for current reserve judgments. In any case, continuing to monitor\nthe options available to borrowers who are unemployed but want to avoid default is crucial for managing reserves and\nprospective judgments about loss emergence.\nVisit our CECL experts page to reach out to one of our authors for more information on this topic or to request regular\nupdates from our research team.\n8 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCEFigure 12 Macroeconomic Variable Mnemonic Citations\nDataBuffet™\nDefault Avoidance US Government Data (Historical and April Forecast\nStrategy Macroeconomic Benchmarks (Historical) Forecast) Trend\nUnemployment Rate FLBR Declining\nAverage Weeks Unemployed N/A\nJob Losers on Temporary\nLayoff N/A\nBureau of Labor Statistics\nPermanent Job Losses N/A\nSeek Alternative\nEmployment/Other Percent of Unemployed on\nIncome Temporary Layoff N/A\nPercent of Unemployed\nJobless 27 Weeks or More FLBUK15GQ Decreasing\nPersonal Income FYPQ Increasing\nBureau of Economic\nPersonal Current Transfer\nAnalysis\nReceipts FYPTQ Increasing\nCurtail Monthly Personal Consumption Bureau of Economic\nExpenses Expenditures (PCE) Analysis C / FC Increasing\nConsumer Loans: Credit Cards\nand Other Revolving Plans, All\nCommercial Banks FCCREVQ Increasing\nConsumer Loans: Other\nConsumer Loans: Automobile\nLoans, All Commercial Banks FBBABLLCCBQ Increasing\nReal Estate Loans: Residential\nReal Estate Loans: Revolving\nHome Equity FBBABLLR1HCBQ Increasing\nReal Estate Loans: Residential\nUnlock Equity/Seek Real Estate Loans, All Board of Governors of the\nAlternative Financing Commercial Banks Federal Reserve System FBBABLLR1CBQ Increasing\nReal Estate as a Share of FYPDPI$Q +\nDisposable Personal Income FZFL155035015Q Increasing\nDeposits as a Share of FYPDPI$Q +\nDisposable Personal Income FNWFA$ Increasing\nCorporate Equities as a Share FYPDPI$Q +\nof Disposable Personal FZFL153064105\nIncome Q Increasing\nHousehold Total Net Worth FZFLHHNWQ Increasing\nOwners’ Equity in Real Estate FNWRE Increasing\nConsumer Price Index: Used US Bureau of Labor\nCars & Trucks Statistics FCPIUETA02 Stable\nReduce/Consolidate\nS&P/Case-Shiller 20-City S&P Dow Jones Indices\nDebt or Defer\nComposite Home Price Index LLC FHCLHP1TI20Q Increasing\nPayments\nBoard of Governors of the\nBank Prime Loan Rate Federal Reserve System FRPRIME Stable\n9 MAY 2021 PLAYING THE WAITING GAME WITH CECL RESERVES AND LOSS EMERGENCE© 2021 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
