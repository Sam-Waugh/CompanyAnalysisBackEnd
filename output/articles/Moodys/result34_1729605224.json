Act like a Seller.\nSpeak like an Advisor.\nUnderstanding the Relationship Manager’s Role\nin Business Lending SuccessThe Back and Forth of Business Lending\nIt’s a scenario that’s all too familiar.\nHaving met with a prospective customer several times, your relationship manager has prepared and\ntendered a loan submission. Your underwriters have begun their review, but quickly find that it’s lacking\nthe information they need to complete their analysis. They reach out to the relationship manager, seeking\nclarification. The relationship manager reaches back out to the customer. A back-and-forth ensues, and the\nsales cycle begins to drag . . . and drag . . . and drag.\nThe underwriter is frustrated.\nThe relationship manager is frustrated.\nThe customer is frustrated—and worse still, beginning to question the relationship manager’s abilities.\nWhat if there were a better way? What if your relationship managers had the skills—and tools—\nthey needed to better collaborate with customers, so that their initial submission included all of the\ninformation your underwriters needed to efficiently evaluate the loan?\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter. Act like a Seller. Speak like an Advisor. 2Though the exact numbers vary by financial institution, it’s no secret that a high percentage of business\nloans are initially declined. Oftentimes, these declines are the result of inadequate or incomplete loan\nsubmissions, meaning that qualified borrowers could be slipping through the cracks. Planning for and\nhaving robust conversations is perhaps the most important precursor to a successful loan submission,\nbut it requires know-how—and the ability to tackle the job from different angles.\nOne Job, Many Hats\nThe frenetic pace of business lending requires relationship managers to\nwear the hats of an underwriter, a salesperson, and an advisor —often all\nat once—just about every day.\nConsider the attributes of underwriters. They’re curious, detail- oriented,\nand methodical. They must possess these characteristics, along with\nrobust credit knowledge, in order to determine whether a loan approval\nis feasible. They evaluate trends in both financial performance and the\nindustry, and determine the best value- added solutions based on financial\nstatements and other data. They are the defenders of the financial\ninstitution’s loan portfolio. At Moody’s Analytics, we\noften conclude our skills\nAnd what are the qualities of an effective salesperson? Most managers\napplication labs by asking\nlook for confidence, credibility, and the ability to uncover a customer’s\nlearners what they’ll\nneeds and priorities. In addition, relationship managers need to be able\nto identify the best solution for the customer, and present the proposed do differently going\nsolution as a “win-win” for both the customer and the financial institution. forward. The response\nwe most often hear from\nRelationship managers should think like an underwriter when preparing for\nsalespeople?\nand executing calls, while simultaneously using their sales skills to remain\ncustomer-focused.\n“I have to think more like\nHow does a lender make that happen? That’s where the role of the advisor an underwriter.”\ncomes in. Most small business owners do not have the knowledge, skills,\nor experience to evaluate their businesses objectively. By using their credit\nanalysis skills, relationship managers can provide a great deal of value to\ntheir customers. By asking the right types of questions, they can gain the\ninformation needed for a successful first-time submission while providing\nthe business owner with valuable financial insights.\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter. Act like a Seller. Speak like an Advisor. 3Telling “The Story”\nAt many financial institutions, the underwriter never speaks to the customer, placing the onus of telling the\nbusiness’s story on the relationship manager, who must be able to describe the customer’s strategies, goals,\nstrengths, and weaknesses (financial and otherwise). If the story is incomplete, the relationship manager\nmay be asked to reach back out to the customer, or the request may simply be declined altogether.\nThe ability to tell a business’s story is not a skill that can be learned overnight. It takes training and practice\nto know how to gather the right information without “grilling” the customer.\nTo master this skill, relationship managers must develop both\ntheir sales skills and their overall business acumen, which\nrequires training, quality coaching, and exposure to many\ndifferent types of businesses. In the fast-paced world of small\nbusiness lending, where relationship managers’ activity goals\nmay include two or more face-to-face calls a day, the more\neffective the relationship manager’s calling skills, the better\nthey are able to paint a complete picture for the loan approver.\nEffective calling, which is key to meeting sales goals and\n“I’ve seen pre-call planners that are\nimproving approval rates, begins with pre-call planning.\nso complex, relationship managers\nfeel that they simply don’t have the\nEmbracing Pre-call Planning\ntime to complete them.

Many relationship managers skip\nthe better.”\nthis step, however, because they think it takes too long, or\nbecause their organization doesn’t provide them with quality\nLaura Beaver\nplanning tools. Skipping pre-call planning or using the wrong\ntools can set lenders up for failure before they even speak with Business lending expert and\nthe customer. Moody’s Analytics facilitator\nThe right tools will prompt relationship managers to prepare\nthe best open-ended questions to ask.\nPlanning thoughtful questions ensures that the customer knows the lender prepared for the call, and that\nyour organization cares about the business. Pre-call planning should prompt the relationship manager to\nreflect on how a potential customer competes in the marketplace and what it needs to do to continue to be\nsuccessful. This builds credibility and helps the lender begin to understand the story behind the financials.\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter. Act like a Seller. Speak like an Advisor. 4By preparing just a few thoughtful questions, the relationship manager encourages the customer to open\nup about their goals, concerns, needs, and progress. If the relationship manager actively listens, they will be\nable to formulate specific follow-up questions based on the customer’s answers. Active listening is crucial to\nunderstanding the business’s story and relaying it to underwriters.\nFinancial institutions should resist developing a pre-call planning tool that is too complex and\ntime-consuming. The over-engineering of a pre-call plan lowers the utility of the tool, meaning\nrelationship managers won’t use it—and may form bad habits in its place. Pre-call planning tools must\nbe user-friendly and readily accessible.\n“I’ve seen many pre-call planners that are so complex, relationship managers feel that they simply don’t\nhave the time to complete them. The simpler, the better,” said Laura Beaver, business lending expert and\nMoody’s Analytics facilitator.\nRelationship managers need to customize just two to three questions to incorporate the industry,\neconomic, and business outlook and have a robust conversation with a prospect. From the customer’s\nperspective, the first call should feel like the beginning of a relationship, not the beginning of a\nproduct-pushing expedition.\nEncourage your relationship managers to set goals and to identify a customer-focused business purpose for\nevery call. Some examples of calling goals include obtaining additional information and setting a follow-up\nappointment.\nAn effective pre-call planning tool will help the relationship\nmanager gather essential information about a prospect’s:\n1 History and mission\n2 Short-term and long-term goals\n3 Strategies for differentiating itself from competitors\n4 Plans for the future, given the industry and economic outlooks\nFinancial results, including what’s driving them and the\n5\nimplications for future performance\n6 Resources needed or concerns\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter.

People do business\nwith those they like and trust.\nKnowing which questions to ask depends on where in the sales cycle the relationship manager is. When\nmeeting with a prospect, asking questions about the business’s operating cycle and cash flow will help\nthe relationship manager get to know the business and will naturally lead to more questions about what\nthe customer does well—and perhaps not so well. Questions should be straightforward and easy for the\ncustomer to answer. It is important not to use “bank speak,” which could intimidate the customer. A\nskilled relationship manager recognizes the customer’s level of financial sophistication and maneuvers the\nconversation accordingly. Even a business owner with low financial acumen can tell you the “whys” behind\nthe numbers if the conversation is conducted properly.\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter. Act like a Seller. Speak like an Advisor. 6Business owners can likely speak to the trends in their sales and profits, but they may not be able to fluently\nanswer questions about margins. So it’s important to ask questions they can answer, such as:\n1\n“How do you know what price to set for your products?”\n2\n“How do you grow sales and also achieve the profits you’re seeking?”\n3\n“How do you manage your operating expenses?”\nBy framing questions in a way that’s easy for the business owner to understand, the relationship manager\nis able to uncover more—and better quality—information, which in turn helps them better understand the\nbusiness’s financial performance and explain it to the underwriter. Actively listening and asking pertinent\nfollow-up questions helps relationship managers assess the strengths and weaknesses of the potential\nborrower. It also resonates with customers when lenders share stories of similar companies they have\nworked with in the past.\nAsking effective, smart questions is a critical skill that requires a disciplined approach, using repeatable\nstrategies and tools. It is a skill that needs to be developed and honed with time, coaching, and the desire\nto improve.\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter. Act like a Seller. Speak like an Advisor. 7Providing Financial Insights\nRelationship managers are the most successful when they are able to develop high-level financial insights\nabout a business’s ability to sustain its cash flow, so that its loans can be repaid as agreed.\nThey must be able to apply their technical knowledge to both their customer conversations and their\nloan submissions. They must also be able to draw high-level conclusions about a business’s financial\nperformance and advocate for the customer in an objective and credible way.\nIn our experience, relationship managers’ biggest skill gap is the inability to have an informative financial\nconversation with the customer and convey that information to underwriters. Relationship managers\nshould be able to perform simple calculations based on financial statements or tax returns and use them\nto develop insightful questions for the customer. A best practice is to use the operating cycle to ask about\nthe changes in the financial ratios. Understanding why the trends occurred will help determine if they will\ncontinue in the future. Past performance is often the best indicator of future performance.\nThe most important jobs that relationship managers can perform when handling credit requests are\ndemonstrating their knowledge during conversations with the customer and underwriter, and being able\nto understand, defend, and help predict ability to repay. It’s also important to be able to explain those\nassumptions and beliefs to the underwriter, who will be approving the loan, and the customer.\nRelationship managers must have certain credit skills, including:\n• A basic understanding of business and personal tax returns\n• The ability to determine if a business will be able to repay debt in a\ntimely manner\n• The ability to assess a business’s debt level\n• The ability to assess how efficiently the business owner handles cash needed\nfor the business and for personal living expenses and debt\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter. Act like a Seller. Speak like an Advisor. 8Growing the Relationship\nRelationship managers must regularly contact their customers\nto maintain ongoing relationships. The most vulnerable\nrelationships are those that are being targeted by your Sharing the decision\ncompetitors.\nOften one of the first questions a relationship manager asks a • Describe how the solution meets the\nprospect is, “When was the last time your banker reached out customer’s specific needs\nto you to discuss your needs?” Encourage your relationship\n• Check for understanding\nmanagers to protect their relationships with regular\ntouchpoints, so that your customers won’t be able to say,\n• Resolve objections\n“Actually, it’s been a long time.”\n• Foster a consultative relationship\nIt’s also important to treat difficult conversations— and even\ndeclines—as opportunities to further build relationships\n(or, at the very least, to preserve the potential for a future\nrelationship).\nOftentimes, the approved solution is different from the one\nthe customer requested—perhaps it’s a smaller loan with\nstricter repayment terms. Because the customer may not have\nqualified for the loan requested, the ensuing conversation can\nbe difficult. The lender must know how to acknowledge the\ncustomer’s disappointment, acknowledge and explore the\ncustomer’s objections to the approved solution, and work to\novercome the objection and move forward.\nRelationship managers also need to be able to share adverse\ndecisions without alienating the customer or closing the door\non a future relationship. When a loan is denied, relationship\nmanagers must be able to recommend steps that the customer\ncan take to improve the odds of an approval in the future, and,\nif appropriate, offer other solutions. If the decline is delivered\nprofessionally and consultatively, many customers may even be\nthankful for the sound advice.\nMoody’s Analytics | Think like an Underwriter. Act like a Seller. Speak like an Advisor. 9Improvement is a Continuous Process\nRelationship management is a challenging role that requires training, perseverance, and experience. A\nsolid understanding of the ways in which credit and sales skills intersect during customer conversations\nwill benefit both the relationship manager and the financial institution, resulting in more efficient lending\nprocesses and higher approval rates.\nThese skills take time to build, though. Continuous improvement begins with an effective, consistent\ntraining program that includes learnable and repeatable strategies and tools. Keep in mind, however, that\nthe strategies and tools required to successfully provide credit solutions aren’t taught in traditional sales\ntraining courses, so it’s important to consider training partners that recognize the unique skills required\nof lenders.\nAnd remember, training is just the starting point! Following training, relationship managers need practical\nexperience and quality coaching to master their skills.\nThe Moody’s Analytics Difference\nWe understand that your business operates in a highly competitive marketplace where the skill level\nof your associates correlates directly with enterprise success.
