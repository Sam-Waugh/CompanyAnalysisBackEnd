For Noble, the challenge was more than just facing the\nimmediate pressures of sinking oil prices. The larger predicament lay in the cascading\nFigure 1 NYMEX Light Sweet Crude, USD per barrel\nramifications that extended throughout their financial ecosystem. Lenders, suppliers, and\nstakeholders, all accustomed to a predictable risk framework, suddenly found themselves\n120\ngrappling with mounting uncertainties. While the commodity price drop acted as\nthe catalyst, the firm’s downward spiral impacted customer supply chains. A lack of\n100\npreparedness and the absence of a robust credit risk strategy amplified the consequences.\nThis dire situation underscores the essential question: How can organizations effectively 80\nanticipate, measure, and mitigate risks in such a mercurial environment?\n60\n40\nInsights\n20\nDrawing insights from Noble’s experience, it is clear that understanding credit risk is\nnot solely about gauging a company’s financial health in isolation. Rather, it requires a\n0\ncomprehensive view that encompasses the entirety of its supply chain and dynamics 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nwithin a firm’s industry. By integrating supply chain analysis and scenario planning,\norganizations can anticipate potential disruptions, weigh their implications, and devise\nstrategies to circumvent them. In the case of offshore drilling contractor customers,\nhad they undertaken a thorough examination of their supply chain’s vulnerabilities to\nfluctuating oil prices and conducted scenario planning for possible downturns, they might\nhave been better equipped to weather the storm. As the saying goes,\n“forewarned is forearmed,” and in the realm of credit risk, these tools are the armor that\ncompanies need.\n1 Bvd ID GB08354954 2Moody’s Analytics | ANALYTICS IN ACTION\nNoble was caught flatfooted; its business model hinged on higher prices to support the back; the stock price collapsed, and Noble’s PD pushed beyond the EWS trigger in May\ncapital investment and maintenance costs required for offshore drilling.

Disaster struck two years later as the COVID-19\npandemic led to a collapse in global oil demand. Facing significant obstacles, Noble\nfiled for bankruptcy in July 2020, aiming to restructure its capital base and streamline\noperations. The firm reached a settlement with Paragon creditors in August, remained in\noperation, and ultimately emerged from bankruptcy in February 2021 with an improved\nbalance sheet position.\n4Moody’s Analytics | ANALYTICS IN ACTION\nFurther, Noble’s risk profile ran against the trend in the broader oil and gas extraction industry. Between 2017 and 2018, when Noble was first flagged as a Severe credit risk, the share\nof firms identified as Low risk increased from 38% to 47%, while the share of Severe risk firms fell from 26% to 20%:\nFigure 6 Evolution of EDF-X EWS Signals for Noble Corporation’s Peer Group\nDecember 2017 December 2018\nPD vs Trigger PD vs Trigger\nThe EDF-X EWS identified Noble as a vulnerable credit well before bankruptcy, allowing firms dependent on the offshore driller to prepare for supply chain disruptions.
