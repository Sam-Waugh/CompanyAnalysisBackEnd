If a pensions scheme’s objectives are longer-term, focusing on short-term\nmetrics might have significant consequences, including for the investment strategy, the ability\nto pay members’ benefits as they fall due, and for the long-term strength of the sponsor and the\nscheme.\nThis paper considers how schemes can look at the longer-term by using asset-liability modeling\nand alternative metrics, which can help with understanding the long-term impact of short-term\ndecisions, and inform an appropriate investment and funding strategy.\nThis approach is consistent with the UK Pensions Regulator’s Integrated Risk Management\napproach to pension funding, which allows long-term analysis to be built in to the triennial funding\ncycle where it is appropriate to do so.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nScheme Objectives, Funding, and Integrated Risk Management\nSCHEME OBJECTIVES AND FUNDING VALUATION\nThe fundamental objective of a defined benefit pension scheme is to pay benefits to members as they\nfall due. While this is a reasonably straightforward statement in itself, the practice is significantly more\ncomplex. In particular, schemes often focus on the short term, and they might be able to consider a wider\nrange of options if they look at the longer term.\nTraditionally, trustees tackle their funding objectives around the triennial valuation cycle. As trustees and\nemployers set out to agree on recovery plans and contribution schedules, understanding the potential\nfunding level of the pension scheme over a three-year horizon can naturally become a primary focus.\nWhy focus on the short term?\nThere are undeniably good reasons for pension schemes to focus on the short term.\nFirst, and most importantly, the regulatory and reporting environment is framed around demonstrating\nsufficiency of assets on an appropriate funding basis. Schemes are required to carry out a formal valuation\nat least triennially, and establish a recovery plan, if needed. Trustees are encouraged to understand how the\ncurrent funding level of the pension scheme is likely to change at the next triennial valuation date.\nThe funding valuation is critically important to a scheme, and the main risk metric for trustees to use\nto make funding decisions. Understanding the potential future funding level should help trustees make\ndecisions around putting a recovery plan in place. Full funding offers comfort that if the sponsor defaults,\nthe scheme should have sufficient assets to meet its obligations.\nTo be consistent with the asset valuation, pension schemes aim to use a market-consistent liability\nvaluation – essentially assessing what price would be paid to secure the liabilities. This makes sense\nin some circumstances – for example if there is an intention to buy-out in a known timescale, or if the\nsponsor covenant is weak.\nHowever, in many cases, the scheme is not about to be transferred or bought out, and in these cases there\nmight not be an independent market view of the value of the liabilities. In this case, the value placed on\nthe liabilities has an element of subjectivity. The key driver of valuation, the valuation discount rate, is\nlargely negotiated between schemes, sponsors, and their advisors. Different actuaries with different views\nof prudence could place different values on the same liabilities. There is a degree of negotiation between\ntrustees and sponsors to agree the basis and the deficit recovery plan.\nIndices - a point to consider\nThere is also a recent trend for tracking the solvency of pension schemes at an aggregate level. Various\nparties publish monthly indices of scheme solvency, identifying the reasons for movements and\ncommenting on the outlook. Different indices focus on different valuation metrics – for example funding or\nPension Protection Fund (PPF) position – and slight variations in the range of schemes covered.\nThese indices are part of a trend to monitor scheme solvency at increasing frequency, some schemes\nmonitor solvency weekly, or even daily.\n2 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nHowever, it is worth considering the wider implications. Remember that valuation bases are agreed\nbetween sponsor and trustees. The triennial funding valuation is only one tool to help schemes ensure\nthat they can meet their benefits as they fall due. But statutory solvency is only one available measure, a\nsnapshot at a moment in time. It can be argued that a valuation locks in a particular interest rate curve, a\nparticular view of asset performance, and a particular recovery plan. Depending on the strength covenant,\nfor instance, a 90% funding level can be sustainable, or it might be disastrous.\nAll of these factors make total solvency an unusual measure to use as the basis for an index.\nWHAT DOES THE ‘TRADITIONAL APPROACH’ MEAN FOR PENSION SCHEMES?\nThis level of scrutiny of funding levels has merit. Funding levels are definitely an issue, and in some cases\nthey are the most important measure for schemes to consider when setting investment and funding\nstrategy. However, they are not the only measure of a pension scheme’s ability to meet its obligations. The\ntraditional approach to valuation and the increasing focus on tracking the short-term promotes a particular\napproach to investment, which might not be the only option for the scheme.\nLooking at other options\nTo determine whether there are other ways to understand the risks in a pension scheme, we need to\nconsider the fundamental objective of a defined benefit pension scheme - to meet the liabilities as they\nfall due.\nStatutory valuation is one way of trying to ensure a pension scheme meets its liabilities. But valuation\nis simply placing a value on benefits to be paid in the future. It does not actually affect the amount of\nthose cash flows – as these will depend on the demographic experience of the scheme and the level of\ninflationary increases to pensions. It also does not give much insight into the level of cash flow at any given\ntime in the future.\nThe funding level gives some indication of the ability of the pension scheme to meet its future benefit\nobligations, but it does not provide the full story. Valuations should therefore be just one of the measures\nthe scheme uses when setting its investment and funding strategy.\nAnother factor worth bearing in mind is the basis used to determine the value placed on benefits. Many UK\ndefined benefit schemes value their liabilities using a “gilts-plus” approach. This means that the evolution\nof the funding level depends critically on changes in gilt yields. If a scheme’s strategy focuses on protecting\nthe funding level relative to a particular basis, this leads to an investment strategy that reduces the funding\nlevel’s exposure to interest rate risk.\nThis approach makes sense for some schemes, but not for all of them.\n3 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nCase studies\nIn these case studies we consider two schemes with long-term goals, and strong sponsors. For each scheme\nwe look at appropriate risk metrics and consider the impact on those metrics of two asset strategies.\nThere is a degree of assumption here, notably:\n» Sponsors are assumed to remain in existence in perpetuity.\n» Asset strategies are assumed to be static over time.\n» A simplified asset universe has been assumed, consisting of government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nequities. Leveraging of up to 2.5× on the government bonds is allowed.\nCASE STUDY 1\nConsider a scheme that is around 75% funded on a gilts + 0.5% basis. The sponsor is making contributions\nof £5 m per annum on the basis of a 15year recovery plan. The aim is to reach full funding in 15 years on\ngilts + 0.5%.\nThe sponsor can afford to increase contributions at the next triennial valuation in three years, but only by\nanother £5 m per annum without impacting on the day-to-day viability of their operations.\nThe trustees want to buy out within fifteen years, if possible.\nSensible risk measures include:\n» Likelihood of reaching full funding within 15 years on gilts + 0.5%.\n» Likelihood of reaching buyout within 15 years.\n» Expected level of contributions at next triennial valuation.\n» Median time to reach full funding.\nTwo investment strategies are considered, optimized to different measures of risk.\nStrategy A - asset mix Strategy B - asset mix\n37.5% Equity 52.5% Equity\n40.0% Gilt/LDI 7.5% Gilt/LDI\n22.5% Corporate Bond 40.0% Corporate Bond\nStrategy A is a fairly typical asset allocation. The mean return delivered is enough to reach full funding after\n15 years, with volatility around this level optimized. Strategy B is more aggressive, and designed to deliver a\ngreater return, but with increased volatility.\nThe impact can be seen when considering the spread of outcomes on the target funding basis after 1 year\nand after 15 years.\n4 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nFigure 1\nYear 1 funding surplus (deficit)\n20%\n10%\n0%\n-140m -120m -100m -80m -60m -40m -20m 0m\nStrategy A Strategy B\nFigure 2\nYear 15 funding surplus (deficit)\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n-200m -100m 0m 100m 200m 300m 400m 500m\nStrategy A Strategy B\nThe two strategies show similar peaks in their distributions of funding levels, but different distributions. The\nnarrower, higher peak of Strategy A reflects the lower volatility of surplus.\nLooking at the likelihood of reaching full funding on gilts + 0.5% shows the impact on both strategies:\n5 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nFigure 3\nLikelihood of reaching full funding over time\n100%\n50%\n0%\n0 5 10 15 20\nStrategy A Strategy B\nSimilarly, for the likelihood of reaching buyout:\nFigure 4\nLikelihood of reaching buyout over time\n100%\n50%\n0%\n0 5 10 15 20\nStrategy A Strategy B\nClearly, the higher equity strategy increases the chance of reaching buyout.\nFinally, consider the distribution of the contribution level at the next triennial valuation.\n6 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nFigure 5\nDistribution of contributions after 3 years\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n0m 5m 10m 15m 20m\nStrategy A Strategy B\nStrategy A is expected to need no further contributions in 3 years with a 7% likelihood. Under strategy B,\nthis likelihood rises to 30%.\nValues for key metrics\nStrategy A Strategy B\n1-year VaR 95 37.6 m 48.5 m\nMedian surplus at time 15 16.9 m 68.5 m\n15-year VaR 95 122.3 m 181.4 m\nLikelihood of reaching full funding within 15 years 59% 71%\nMedian time to reach full funding 11 years 8 years\nExpected level of contributions at next valuation 5.1 m 3.3 m\nConclusions\nIt comes as no surprise that a riskier strategy offers greater rewards in the long term. However, this\napproach allows that risk/reward pay-off to be assessed. Strategy A offers lower value at risk figures, and\nmight therefore be seen as less risky. The higher risk is more than offset by the expected outperformance\nin strategy B on other long-term metrics, reducing contribution volatility and increasing the likelihood of\nreaching full funding.\nThis conclusion factors in the nature of the scheme modeled, in particular the assumed shape of its cash\nflow profile. A different cash flow profile with the same funding level and the same liability duration could\nlead to significantly different conclusions.\n7 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nCASE STUDY 2\nConsider a scheme that is fully funded on a gilts + 1% basis. The sponsor is strong, and there are no\ncontributions currently payable.\nThere is no immediate intention to get rid of the scheme. Realistically, the sponsor and trustees think that\nthe costs of managing the scheme in-house are reasonable until the liability falls below £20 m (on gilts +\n1%).The sponsors and trustees would want to look at buyout if the funding level exceeded 120% on the\ncurrent funding basis. Other than that, they expect the scheme to remain in force for the long term.\nHere, sensible risk measures include:\n» Expected term until the scheme runs out of money, assuming no further contributions are made.\n» Expected asset holding when the self-sufficiency liability falls below £20 m.\n» Median term until the self-sufficiency liability exceeds 120% on gilts + 1%\nTwo investment strategies are considered, again optimized to different measures of risk.\nStrategy A - asset mix Strategy B - asset mix\n2.5% Equity 57.5% Equity\n42.5% Gilt/LDI 40.0% Gilt/LDI\n55.0% Corporate Bond 2.5% Corporate Bond\nAgain, Strategy A would be considered a reasonably typical asset allocation for this type of scenario. The\nhigh level of corporate bond holding provides a good match for liabilities, and offers the higher return\nrequired to reduce volatility relative to the effective target of gilts + 1%. Strategy B is more aggressive and\nis designed to deliver a greater return.\nThis can be seen if we look at the projected spread of surplus after one year.\nFigure 6\nYear 1 outcomes\n50%\n25%\n0%\n-100.0m -50.0m 0.0m 50.0m 100.0m 150.0m\nStrategy A Strategy B\nStrategy A exhibits a much lower level of risk, demonstrated by the narrower, higher peak in the\ndistribution. This corresponds to a value at risk of £24 m, compared to strategy B’s VaR of £42 m. However,\n8 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nthe skew in the distribution here is already visible, with strategy B clearly showing an increase in the\nmedian outcome.\nOver the longer term, this will have a significant impact.\nLooking at some of the other metrics:\nFigure 7\nProbability of asset exhaustion over time\n100%\n50%\n0%\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nStrategy A Strategy B\nThere is a 33% chance that strategy A exhausts assets within 25 years – compared to 10% for strategy B\nFigure 8\nProbability of reaching buyout over time\n100%\n50%\n0%\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nStrategy A Strategy B\nSimilarly, the long-term likelihood of reaching the stretch target (based on funding reaching 120% on gilts\n+ 1%) is around 80% on strategy B compared to around 25% on strategy A.\n9 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nValues for key metrics\nStrategy A Strategy B\n1-year VaR 95 24.3 m 42.2 m\nMedian term until asset exhaustion 28 n/a\nTerm until 25% chance of asset exhaustion 23 38\nExpected asset holding when the liability falls below £20 m -410.8 m 721.8 m\nMedian term until scheme considers buyout n/a 5\nTerm until 25% chance of considering buyout 15 2\nConclusions\nAgain, strategy A is much less volatile, which should preserve funding. However, the funding level is based\non gilts + 1%, which means that some higher-risk assets must be held. Adopting a riskier strategy can\nincrease the schemes chances of reaching its secondary objective of reaching buy-out as well as being able\nto pay its liabilities as they fall due.\nOVERALL CONCLUSIONS\nThese strategies and schemes are slightly artificial, however it is clear that both sponsors and trustees who\nlook at longer-term objectives and metrics would formulate an investment strategy closer to strategy B in\nboth cases. However, typically, the lower-VaR strategies tend to dominate.\nIn both cases, strategy A is designed to minimize value at risk against the current funding measure, while\nstrategy B is optimized against longer term goals. As a result, strategy A involves holding a high proportion\nof gilts, sensible when the risk being hedged is defined in terms of the return on gilts.\nWhen we consider longer term goals, however, the valuation basis becomes less relevant. Considering the\nmetrics around asset exhaustion, for instance, the time until there is a 25% chance of asset exhaustion\ndepends solely on the cash flows and the assets, it is entirely independent of the valuation basis chosen.\n10 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nPutting this in to practice\nAN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe UK Pension Regulator’s Code of Practice on Integrated Risk Management sets out key principles for\nhow trustees and employers should seek to agree funding plans.\nThe approach should be collaborative, understanding risk, bearing in mind the sponsor’s risk tolerance, and\ntaking a long-term view of the risks inherent in the pension scheme. The aim of this integrated approach\nis to encourage trustees to establish a continuous process to manage the risks in their pension scheme,\ninstead of the traditional cyclical approach with the triennial valuation triggering discussions around\nfunding and investment.\nHowever, this approach does not necessarily sit easily alongside a more traditional valuation approach\nwhere trustee, sponsor, and advisers negotiate a basis, carefully validating and justifying assumptions, and\nagreeing on a recovery plan.\nBuilding integrated risk management into the valuation process can appear cumbersome. Different\ninvestment strategies can lead to different discount rates, and the valuation basis for a sponsor with a\nstrong covenant will differ from the valuation basis for a sponsor with a weak covenant.\nHowever, the fact that the valuation basis is negotiated gives a way into this iterative process, increasing\ntransparency around decision-making.\nBy looking at alternative metrics other than the funding level, it is possible to look at the precise measures\nthat parties are interested in. For example, the likelihood of contributions increasing at the next valuation,\nthe likelihood of paying all of the benefits as they fall due, or the expected time to reach buyout, and to\nunderstand the trade-off between them.\nIf this approach is used to determine the investment strategy and the contribution strategy, the formal\ntriennial valuation becomes almost secondary, and much less confrontational. From the point of view of\nthe sponsor, the contribution schedule is an input into the statutory valuation calculation rather than\na result.\nSTART FROM THE OUTCOME\nBuilding asset-liability modeling into an integrated risk management framework, it might be possible to\nsimplify the valuation process.\nThe process essentially becomes:\n» Agree on appropriate objectives for the sponsor and the trustee, such as reaching self-sufficiency or\nbuyout, and decide on suitable metrics for these, such as:\n• The likelihood of reaching full funding\n• The volatility of contributions\n• The chances of the deficit exceeding a threshold\n• One-year value at risk\nThis process can be completed before any decisions are made, and can form the framework for reaching\nagreement.\n» Look at a range of investment and contribution strategies and their impact on those metrics.\n11 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n» Based on the trade-offs between these metrics, agree on an investment strategy and contribution\nschedule. For schemes with long-term metrics, the impact of the choice of valuation basis is reduced.\n» Construct a valuation basis that supports the agreed contribution schedule as an output.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nBy putting asset-liability modeling at the heart of the valuation process, the investment strategy becomes\nfocused on the objectives of the scheme rather than automatically focusing on protecting the solvency\nlevel. This might mean better outcomes in the future for the scheme, for the sponsor and ultimately\nfor members.\nThis process is also far better aligned to the key tenets of the integrated risk management framework. It\nencourages collaboration, a clear and concise framework alongside suitable and proportionate use of tools,\nand supports a continual approach to measuring, monitoring, and managing the risks in pension schemes.\n12 OCTOBER 2017 ASSET-LIABILITY MODELING AND INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SUMMARYMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n© 2017 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
