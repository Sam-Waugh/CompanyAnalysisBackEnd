We performed this analysis by running firms’ financial statements through default risk models and comparing the\nfollowing risk measures:\n1. COVID-19 point-in-time (PIT) probability of default (PD). This point-in-time probability of default risk measure includes\nthe economic stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic and oil price shocks per the as-of date for this analysis.\n2. Through-the-cycle (TTC) PD. This measure captures the risk level associated with firms’ financial ratios without any\nconsideration of prevailing credit cycle conditions.\nWe compare these measures to evaluate how COVID-19 point-in-time probability of default measures exceed through-the-cycle\nprobability of default measures (TTC PD vs COVID-19 PD). We perform this analysis at an industry level and at the risk-band level\nwithin industries to identify which industries COVID-19 affects most and with what magnitude. We do not stress financials for\nindividual firms because we expect that market reactions captured by the PIT PD reflect potential future changes in financials.\nData\nThe middle-market sample includes 30,000 US private firms. We selected all of the firms in our US database with financial\nstatements available in the last three years. The US database is built through cooperation with more than 20 banks.\nThe chart on the left in Exhibit 1 shows the distribution of firms, which span all the industry sectors in the model. The Unassigned\nsector is for firms that either do not have an industry identifier or are in an industry that does not map to the RiskCalc™ model’s\nsectors. The chart on the right shows the firms’ geographic location. The Mid-Atlantic, North Central, and South East regions\ncapture the most borrowers, though all regions are represented.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n3Exhibit 1 Industry and geographic distribution for middle-market firms in the COVID-19 exercise sample\nSource: Moody’s Analytics Data Alliance\nExhibit 2 shows the distribution of firms by total asset size. Over half of the firms in the sample have total assets between\n$1 million and $40 million. Approximately 16% of the sample has total assets greater than $320 million.\nExhibit 2 Distribution by total assets for middle-market firms in the COVID-19 exercise sample\nSource: Moody’s Analytics Data Alliance\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n4Analysis and results\nMethodology\nThe analysis measures the impact of COVID-19 and the oil price shocks on default risk for borrowers. Our model uses financial\nstatement data and associated default observations on historical data samples with defining characteristics similar to those of the\ndata samples used in this exercise. We evaluate firms by their PD measure. The model produces through-the-cycle default risk\nmeasures using only firms’ financial statements without any consideration of the prevailing credit cycle conditions. It also\nproduces point-in-time default risk measures that account for the credit cycle by translating public equity market signals and\nunemployment information. The model also translates PD into a PD-implied rating.1\nWe compare these measures to evaluate how COVID-19 has changed point-in-time probability of default measures from\nthrough-the-cycle levels. We perform this analysis at an industry level and at the risk-band level within industries.\nResults\nServices and Consumer Products see the greatest increase in risk\nTo measure the impact of recent events by rating grade, in Exhibit 3 we take a firm whose financial ratios imply a TTC PD rating of\nBaa2 (~0.35% PD) and apply the COVID-19 credit cycle adjustment of each industry to see how recent developments affect\ndefault probability at different starting risk levels. The unadjusted PIT PD shows how the credit cycle at the end of February affects\nratings. There was a 0.15% spread between the riskiest and least risky sectors, with some sectors still showing resilience. The\nCOVID-19 PIT PD shows how the most recent events have increased risk for all sectors and tightened the range of sector PIT PDs\nto nearly 0.1%. Services and Consumer Products have the highest risk level and Agriculture and Health Care have the lowest risk\nlevel in terms of magnitude following the impact of COVID-19. All industries have at least twice as high default risk compared to\nTTC measures.\nThe table on the right in Exhibit 3 measures the PD movement for each sector from the TTC to the COVID-19 PIT PD. Users can\napply this percentage change to their TTC PD to approximate the impact of the coronavirus on their portfolio. For example, if you\nhave an agriculture firm that has a risk profile similar to a Baa2 risk rating with a TTC PD of 0.35%, you can multiply that 0.35%\nTTC PD by (1 + 102%) to get a point-in-time default risk measure of 0.71% that incorporates the coronavirus credit cycle stressors.\nAppendix II: Expected Movements in PIT PD Due to COVID-19 presents tables with percentage change adjustments for each\nindustry and implied-rating grade combination.\n1 The PD-implied or EDF-implied rating is generally consistent with the default rates of bond ratings as measured by Moody’s Investors Service Default Studies.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n5Exhibit 3 Change from the TTC PD to the COVID-19 PIT PD by industry for Baa2 firms\n% CHANGE TTC TO\nGRADE: BAA2 COVID-19 PIT\nAgriculture 102%\nBusiness Products 117%\nBusiness Services 117%\nCommunication 125%\nConstruction 112%\nConsumer Products 127%\nHealth Care 100%\nHiTech 106%\nMining 112%\nServices 132%\nTrade 120%\nTransportation 117%\nUnassigned 117%\nUtilities 104%\nImpact on expected losses\nTo assess potential impacts on expected losses, we assume a constant loss given default (LGD) of 50% and multiply it by our\nmonthly weighted average PIT PDs. Exhibit 4 charts the weighted average expected loss rates beginning in January 2019 through\nApril 7, 2020. The final datapoint shows the COVID-19 PIT PD based on the latest credit cycle information. We see expected loss\nrates increase by more than double since the onset of COVID-19.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n6Exhibit 4 Progression of expected loss rates\nConclusion\nThe global coronavirus contagion and the drop in oil prices has shocked firms across all sectors and sizes. Month-over-month, we\ntypically do not expect many PIT risk rating grade changes—and if there are changes, they are usually not more than a one-rating\ngrade upgrade or downgrade. Exhibit 5 illustrates that COVID-19 and oil price shocks have, in general, downgraded borrowers by\none or two rating grades across sectors and firm sizes. Roughly 5% of borrowers see no rating grade impact. Nearly 20% see a\none-grade downgrade, more than 55% see a two-grade downgrade, and almost 20% have a three- or four-notch downgrade.\nAlthough all industries are negatively affected, Services and Consumer Products see the greatest increase in risk from TTC PD. PIT\nPD and downgrades have gotten worse since our last update that used credit cycle information from March 24, 2020.2 We\ncontinue to monitor equity market response to COVID-19 that may influence the PIT PD.\n2 https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1222395\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n7Exhibit 5 Change in implied ratings due to the COVID-19 PIT PD (all downgrades)\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n8Appendixes\nAppendix I: Credit Cycle Adjustment Overview\nThe credit cycle adjustment (CCA) model produces our PIT risk measures. It accounts for the credit cycle by combining the\ndistance-to-default (DD). DD factors for a given month are obtained in the beginning of the next month. Data goes through\nquality checks and additional transformations to be released in the CCA for the following month.\nExhibit 6 illustrates the progression of the through-the-cycle default risk measure through our financial statement only (FSO)\nmodel (TTC PD model) before applying the adjustment to produce the point-in-time CCA default risk measure. The CCA model\ndemonstrates how the current market signals compare to historical market signals. If the current credit environment is better than\nthe historical average, we adjust the FSO EDF™ (Expected Default Frequency) down to arrive at a less risky CCA EDF. If the current\ncredit environment is worse than the historical average, we adjust the FSO EDF up to arrive at a riskier CCA EDF. EDF is Moody’s\nAnalytics nomenclature for probability of default.\nExhibit 6 Illustrative progression of the CCA model\nAppendix II: Expected Movements in PIT PD Due to COVID-19\nChange in EDF from the FSO to the COVID-19 CCA EDF\nExhibit 7 identifies the expected change in CCA EDF (PIT PD) relative to the FSO EDF (TTC PD) when using the latest credit market\nsignals per this study’s as-of date.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n9Exhibit 7 Change in PD from the TTC to the COVID-19 PIT PD\nSECTOR A1 A2 A3 BAA1 BAA2 BAA3 BA1 BA2 BA3 B1 B2 B3 CAA/C\nConsumer Products 29% 66% 87% 101% 127% 172% 196% 197% 240% 236% 194% 139% 91%\nServices 30% 68% 89% 104% 132% 177% 202% 206% 247% 241% 197% 141% 93%\nConstruction 27% 60% 80% 92% 112% 155% 175% 181% 214% 217% 182% 129% 84%\nTrade 28% 63% 84% 97% 120% 165% 186% 190% 229% 228% 188% 134% 87%\nBusiness Products 28% 62% 83% 96% 117% 162% 182% 187% 224% 224% 186% 132% 86%\nBusiness Services 28% 62% 82% 95% 117% 161% 182% 187% 224% 224% 186% 132% 86%\nTransportation 28% 62% 82% 95% 117% 161% 181% 186% 223% 224% 186% 132% 86%\nHiTech 26% 57% 77% 89% 106% 148% 167% 174% 203% 210% 176% 125% 81%\nAgriculture 26% 56% 75% 86% 102% 144% 163% 170% 197% 205% 173% 122% 79%\nHealth Care 25% 54% 74% 85% 100% 141% 159% 166% 192% 201% 171% 120% 77%\nUtilities 26% 56% 76% 87% 104% 146% 165% 171% 200% 207% 175% 123% 80%\nMining 27% 60% 80% 92% 112% 155% 175% 180% 214% 217% 181% 129% 83%\nCommunication 29% 65% 86% 100% 125% 170% 193% 195% 237% 234% 192% 137% 90%\nUnassigned 28% 62% 82% 95% 117% 160% 181% 186% 222% 223% 185% 132% 86%\nExhibit 8 presents the change in five-year EDF (PD) that represents the longer-run impact of COVID-19 relative to the FSO EDF\n(TTC PD) when using the latest credit market signals per this study’s as-of date.\nExhibit 8 Change in PD from the TTC to the COVID-19 PIT PD\nSECTOR A1 A2 A3 BAA1 BAA2 BAA3 BA1 BA2 BA3 B1 B2 B3 CAA/C\nConsumer Products 4% 8% 51% 41% 48% 56% 57% 59% 69% 71% 79% 78% 57%\nServices 4% 9% 52% 41% 49% 57% 58% 61% 70% 73% 80% 80% 58%\nConstruction 3% 8% 48% 38% 44% 52% 52% 54% 65% 65% 74% 72% 53%\nTrade 4% 8% 50% 39% 46% 54% 55% 57% 68% 68% 76% 75% 55%\nBusiness Products 4% 8% 49% 39% 45% 53% 54% 56% 67% 67% 76% 74% 54%\nBusiness Services 4% 8% 49% 39% 45% 53% 54% 56% 67% 67% 75% 74% 54%\nTransportation 4% 8% 49% 39% 45% 53% 54% 56% 67% 67% 75% 74% 54%\nHiTech 3% 8% 47% 36% 43% 50% 51% 52% 63% 63% 71% 70% 51%\nAgriculture 3% 8% 46% 35% 42% 49% 50% 51% 61% 61% 69% 68% 50%\nHealth Care 3% 7% 45% 35% 41% 48% 49% 50% 60% 60% 68% 67% 49%\nUtilities 3% 8% 46% 36% 42% 49% 50% 52% 62% 62% 70% 69% 51%\nMining 3% 8% 48% 37% 44% 52% 52% 54% 65% 65% 73% 72% 53%\nCommunication 4% 8% 51% 40% 47% 56% 56% 58% 69% 71% 78% 77% 56%\nUnassigned 4% 8% 49% 38% 45% 53% 54% 55% 67% 67% 75% 74% 54%\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n10Appendix III: Average Probability of Default by Rating Grade\nExhibit 9 presents the average EDF (or PD) by rating grade.\nExhibit 9 Average PD by rating grade\nRATING AVERAGE PD\nAaa 0.01%\nAa1 0.02%\nAa2 0.04%\nAa3 0.07%\nA1 0.11%\nA2 0.16%\nA3 0.20%\nBaa1 0.25%\nBaa2 0.35%\nBaa3 0.53%\nBa1 0.85%\nBa2 1.35%\nBa3 2.02%\nB1 3.03%\nB2 4.55%\nB3 6.82%\nCaa/C 17.10%\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS COVID-19 IMPACT ON UNITED STATES MIDDLE MARKET CORPORATE FIRM CREDIT RISK\n11© 2020 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
