Moody’s Analytics has\npublished a series of reports throughout the election cycle analysing the candidates’ proposed tax and economic plans.\n2 The authors have not made contributions to either presidential candidate during this election cycle. Mark Zandi previously served as an economic advisor to the 2008\nJohn McCain presidential campaign.\n3 This is the Moody’s Analytics August 2020 baseline. The likelihood of these scenarios is based on current poll results and our model of the presidential\nelection outcome.\n4 In the Democratic Sweep and Republican Sweep Scenarios we effectively assume the Senate does away with the filibuster rule to allow for full adoption of Biden’s and\nTrump’s policies, respectively. This further reduces the odds that these scenarios will actually occur, but they bookend the possible economic outlooks due to policy\nchanges resulting from the outcome of the election.\n5 Moody’s Analytics, a unit of Moody’s Corp., provides economic analysis to market participants to help them measure and manage risk. It operates independently of\nMoody’s Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.\n6 A detailed description of the Moody’s Analytics model of the U.S. economy is available here. More detailed validation documentation is available on request.\n7 See “The Macroeconomic Consequences of Mr. Trump’s Economic Policies,” Mark Zandi, Chris Lafakis, Dan White and Adam Ozimek, Moody’s Analytics white paper,\nJune 2016.

If there is a\nserious second wave, the outlook and policy response could change significantly.\n10 The static budget cost of a tax or government spending policy does not account for the impact of that policy on economic growth and the resulting impact on the cost\nof that policy. The dynamic budget cost does account for this.\n11 Biden has called for a $15 minimum wage, although he does not specify over what period of time it would be implemented. However, we assume that the federal\nminimum wage is raised incrementally over six years until it reaches $15 in 2027. This assumption is based from the Raise the Wage Act of 2019 passed last year by\nHouse Democrats.\n12 Hysteresis is a reduction in the economy’s potential due to a significant economic shock such as a pandemic, which causes a large number of business failures and\nbankruptcies, permanent job loss, credit problems, and reduced mobility of labor and capital. Once hysteresis sets in, it is difficult to reverse. Hysteresis effects are built\ninto the Moody’s Analytics macro model.\n13 The Trump administration has consistently argued that the U.S. economy will rebound quickly from the pandemic, fully recovering in just a few months. That is, it will\nexperience a V-shape recovery.\n14 According to an analysis by the CBO of the last major legislative attempt at immigration reform in 2013, “immigration of highly skilled immigrants would tend to gen-\nerate additional technological advancements, such as new inventions and improvements in production processes.”\n15 Under current Senate rules, budget reconciliation allows for tax and government policies that are budget neutral over the 10-year budget horizon.\n16 Our analysis of Biden’s tax proposals relies significantly on analysis by the Tax Policy Center.\n17 Our analysis of Biden’s spending proposals relies significantly on analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n18 Similar to the FAMILY Act sponsored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Unlike the FAMILY Act, however, Biden does not support an across-the-board payroll tax\nincrease to pay for the plan (nor an employer mandate) and instead would pay for it with a portion of the proposed taxes on the wealthy.\n19 Our analysis of Trump’s tax proposals leans heavily on alternative budget forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, and\nTrump’s fiscal 2021 budget.\n20 Our assumptions for Trump’s spending plan rely significantly on his fiscal 2021 budget proposals.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS The MacroeconoMic consequences: TruMp vs. Biden 18About the Authors\nMark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, where he directs economic research.
