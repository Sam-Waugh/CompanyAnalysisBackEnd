Petro has failed to\ndeliver on many of his campaign promises amid\ndeteriorating economic conditions and numerous political\nscandals. Early this year, his son was indicted on money\nlaundering charges involving campaign finance. Meanwhile,\nmany members of his original cabinet have left the\nadministration due to growing infighting. Petro has shown\nlittle patience to negotiate with congress in his attempt to\nadvance important social reforms, including overhauling the\ncountry’s health and labor systems.

Many of Petro’s reform proposals are\nunpopular with the financial community because they entail\nincreasing government intervention, with negative\nimplications for the country’s long-term fiscal health and\neconomic growth potential. Markets have also questioned\nPetro’s intention to quickly phase out fossil fuels.
