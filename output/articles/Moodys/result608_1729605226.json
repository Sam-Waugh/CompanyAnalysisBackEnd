Introduction\nThe pandemic-related events of 2020 and 2021 have demonstrated the inherent value of robust and streamlined methods for\nassessing credit portfolio concentration risks. Recognising the economic risks stemming from portfolio concentration, as well as\nregulatory impacts, are compelling financial institutions to develop more nuanced and insightful economic and concentration risk\nmeasures. Concentration risk is the impact of common risk factors that can result in substantial losses to a segment of a credit\nportfolio, and it can originate from two types of imperfect diversification. “Name concentration” relates to imperfect\ndiversification of idiosyncratic risk in the portfolio, either because of its small size or because of large exposures to specific\nindividual obligors. “Segment concentration” relates to imperfect diversification across systematic components of risk, namely\ncountry and industry factors. Calculating economic capital using Moody’s Analytics RiskFrontier™ accounts for various effects that\ncan drive tail losses, including name and segment concentration.\nThis paper describes our methodology for assessing these concentration risks.1 Our approach to calculating name concentration\nleverages RiskFrontier's instrument-level, trial-by-trial risk metrics from its simulation engine. We isolate the idiosyncratic\ncomponent of each instrument’s return in a portfolio to obtain instrument values without the effects of name concentration;\nthese values are then aggregated to construct a new portfolio value and loss distribution. From this new portfolio loss distribution,\nwe can calculate various portfolio-referent risk statistics, of which our main focus is economic capital. Specifically, the method\nproduces portfolio economic capital, without name concentration, at a given target probability, without running additional\nsimulation analyses.\nOur approach to calculating a portfolio’s segment concentration builds upon the aforementioned name concentration method, as\nwell as one of our key findings, the fact that we must consider the cross-sectional variation in risk concentration — economic\ncapital depends on exposure size in a non-linear fashion. After removing name-concentration effects, we can analyse either\ncountry- or industry-concentration impacts. We construct our method in a way that isolates the concentration effect of each\ncountry or industry in a portfolio, without running additional simulation analyses. We then calculate the difference between the\noriginal capital allocation for a certain segment as well as that of the portfolio with no concentration in this segment. We call this\nmetric the “segment concentration charge.” We repeat this calculation for all segments within a portfolio, and then calculate the\nportfolio economic capital without country or industry concentration by taking the difference between the original portfolio\neconomic capital and the sum of all segment concentration charges in the portfolio.\nTo help guard against losses, global regulators have imposed wide-ranging guidelines, recognising the importance of quantifying\nconcentration risks. The recent European Central Bank (ECB) Guide, defines the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (or\nmore commonly known as ICAAP) as requiring risk quantification methodologies that are “robust, risk sensitive, as well as\nsufficiently stable.” Organisations are required to ensure risk concentration is taken into account in their provisioning and stress\ntest models. Similarly, the 2020 European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on loan origination and monitoring states that:2\n“The institution’s credit risk appetite should specify the scope and focus of the credit risk of the institution, the composition of the credit\nportfolio, including its concentration, and diversification objectives in relation to business lines, geographies, economic sectors and\nproducts ... When monitoring credit risk, institutions should have appropriate methodologies and practices, allowing the aggregation of\ncredit risk exposures in business lines, portfolios, sub-portfolios, products, industries and geographical segments, and support the\nidentification of credit risk concentrations.”\nOn the insurance front, the EU’s Solvency II Directive includes a section3 dedicated to the supervision of risk concentrations,\ncalling for its member states to require insurance and reinsurance undertakings (or insurance holding companies or mixed financial\nholding companies) to report at least annually to the group supervisor any significant risk concentration.\nIn North America, guidelines4 published by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) outline expectations\nfor institutions to monitor risk concentrations. The Federal Reserve’s guidance highlights the need for organisations to identify,\n1 For further discussion on concentration risk, see Amnon Levy, et al., “Concentration Risk Consideration During the Allowance Process and COVID-19’s\nImpact.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, April 2020.\n2 European Banking Authority, “Final Report – Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring,” 29 May 2020.\n3 Europe Parliament, Directive 2009/138/EU (Solvency II), 25 November 2009.\n4 See e.g., Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada, ICAAP for Deposit-Taking Institutions (2010): “The impact of risk concentrations should\nbe reflected in an institution’s ICAAP ... An institution should understand its firm-wide credit risk concentrations resulting from similar exposures across its\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 3monitor, and manage concentration risk on a standalone and organisation-wide basis. In particular, according to its Correspondent\nConcentration Risks (CCR) guidance, financial institutions must go above and beyond the minimum requirements “to identify,\nmonitor, and manage correspondent concentration risks in a safe and sound manner, especially when there are rapid changes in market\nconditions or in a correspondent’s financial condition.”5\nSome key findings from our case study include capital relief of 21% when removing the effects of name and country concentration\nfrom our most concentrated portfolio case. We find that even in our least-concentrated portfolio case — created by redistributing\nnotional within the aforementioned portfolio, reducing the weight of the large, single name exposures, and also increasing the\nnumber of countries and industries the portfolio is exposed to — we still see economic capital relief of 6.1%. By analysing an\nindividual name within the portfolio — the highest-weighted name in the portfolio accounting for 7.5% of total notional — we\nunderstand why name concentrations are much riskier and create larger capital values. We see that the portfolio capital value\ndecreases as this name is split up equally into 3, 30, 300, and 3,000 names of equivalent risk profile, but it begins to converge as\nthis name eventually reaches infinite granularity. We discuss the effects of this granularity increase on both the portfolio\ndistribution tail and the contribution to portfolio value volatility, or, its risk contribution.\nOur segment concentration case study highlights two segments that would benefit most from further diversification: Banks and\nS&Ls and Textiles. After removing the effects of industry concentration from the portfolio, 63.2% of the capital relief comes from\nthese segments. We see slightly higher capital relief in the Banks and S&Ls despite having the same notional weight in the\nportfolio as Textiles, a difference we explore further.\nWe conduct a risk-limit and portfolio optimisation exercise and see further reasoning as to why we should remove weight in\nexposures within the Banks and S&Ls and Textiles segments. Even after removing concentration effects, we still see that these two\nsegments are negatively mispriced. The portfolio will benefit from redistributing notional from these segments to less heavily-\nweighted industries within the portfolio, such as Utilities, Electric or Air Transportation, which provide potential for improved\nperformance. The risk-limit exercise provides further proof of the benefits of this change. After removing name concentration\neffects, we still see that the Banks and S&Ls and Textiles segments exceed the risk limit, so the portfolio requires further\ndiversification along with a redistribution of capital to other segments. It is clear that the notional weighting of the Utilities and Air\nTransportation segments may be increased, yet remain well within the risk limit of 15% total portfolio unexpected loss.\nWe organise the paper as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology utilised to obtain quantification of name and segment\nconcentration in a credit portfolio. Section 3 describes the portfolio composition, simulation outputs, and various other input data\nused for calculations. Section 4 discusses the results, namely the portfolio-level capital decomposition and capital decomposition\nby various segmentation, as well as strategic portfolio planning analysis.

Methodology\nThis section explores the methods we employ to quantify the level of concentration risk (both name and segment) present in a\ncredit portfolio. By applying these methods, we can view a portfolio’s decomposition of economic capital to provide an\nunderstanding of the total portfolio capital accounted for by name and segment concentration. This process allows us to view how\nmuch capital relief can be realised, if we reduce concentration levels in the portfolio by reducing weights in certain exposures. Our\nmethodology’s flexibility enables us to assess concentration on a granular level, allowing us to identify the borrowers or segments\nwhose concentration is of the most potential risk to portfolio performance, and also allowing us to incorporate these results into\nstrategic decision-making exercises. Section 4 explores these ideas in more depth.\nIt is important to recognise that to accurately assess concentration levels, we must understand the correlations between assets in\na portfolio. When a portfolio contains large exposures to a single name or segment, then instrument performance is heavily\ncorrelated, and we see a larger portion of the portfolio defaulting at any one time, creating large losses. We, therefore, review our\nprocess of modeling asset correlations in Section 2.1, before presenting our name and segment concentration methodology in\nSections 2.2 and 2.3.\n2.1 Modeling Asset Correlations in a Credit Portfolio\nTo quantify overall portfolio credit risk, it is important to determine correlations between the future value of instruments within a\nportfolio. Estimating correlations in large portfolios can be tricky, as it involves the computation of a correlation coefficient for\neach pair of instruments in the portfolio, which in itself is an extensive task, but which also can lead to noisy estimates and\nspurious correlations. The market value of a firm’s assets is also not directly observable.\nTo assess asset correlations within a portfolio, Moody’s Analytics developed a rich global factor model6 (GCorr™) that provides\npairwise asset correlations for approximately 48,218 publicly traded firms, as well as a model for mid-market firms, retail\nborrowers, commercial real estate, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, and sovereigns. In addition, RiskFrontier™ provides\nsubstantial flexibility in its correlation structure by allowing specification of an arbitrary factor model or pairwise correlation matrix\nfor counterparties in the portfolio, where the joint distribution can be described by a Gaussian copula.\nTo measure credit risk in a portfolio, it is necessary to construct a portfolio value (or loss) distribution, from which risk measures\ncan be calculated, such as economic capital. To construct such a distribution, regardless of the specified correlation structure,\nRiskFrontier utilises a bottom-up approach, in which correlations describe the co-movement in credit states. Specifically, for each\nborrower in the portfolio, correlated asset returns are simulated in a single step Monte Carlo simulation. The asset returns reflect\nthe borrower’s credit quality at horizon, used to determine the value of each exposure.\nThe asset return in a single Monte Carlo simulation trial is given by:\n𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 =�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖+�1−𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 (1)\nwhere\nis the asset return of borrower i,\nis the systematic factor of borrower i,\n𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖\nis the R-squared of borrower i, and\n𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖\nis the idiosyncratic factor of borrower i.\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖\n𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖\nThe systematic factor, , captures the risk in common with other firms.

The shocks of\ntwo counterparties with the same systematic factor will be the same. However, the idiosyncratic (or firm-specific) component is\nalways unique to each\nco𝜀𝜀u𝑖𝑖\nnterparty.\n6 Jimmy Huang, et al., “Modeling Credit Correlations: An Overview of the Moody’s Analytics GCorr Model.\" Moody’s Analytics, December 2012.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 5Simulated asset returns, , are mapped to instrument values, which are dependent on the valuation method selected prior to\nsimulation.\n𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖\nMathematically, the correlation between changes in credit quality measures for any two borrowers, both within and across asset\nclasses, is equal to the following.\n𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟�𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖,𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗�=𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟��𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖+�1−𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗+�1−𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗�\n𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐��𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖+�1−𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗+�1−𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗�\n= (2)\n𝜎𝜎𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖,𝜎𝜎𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗\n�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 �𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖,𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗)\n= =�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 �𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖,𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗)\n1∗1\nNote, if the underlying borrowers are part of the same market and thus share the same systematic factor, the correlation is equal\nto the product of the square root of the two borrower’s R-squared values. Moody’s Analytics GCorr framework is a multifactor\ncorrelation model with more than 800 factors. These factors are the building blocks of an individual borrower's systematic\ncomponent, dependent on what systematic risk the borrower is exposed to. As an example, GCorr Corporate7 is a forward-looking,\nmulti-factor model for asset correlations of publicly traded firms, and can be graphically represented by the scheme in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 GCorr: Decomposing obligor’s risk.\nObligor/Counterparty\nSystematic Idiosyncratic\nFac𝜙𝜙t𝑖𝑖\nors\nFa𝜀𝜀c𝑖𝑖\ntor\nGeographic Industry Sector\nFactors Factors\nThe systematic component of an individual counterparty is a custom index of factors, dependent on the asset class.

This type\nof concentration reduces portfolio diversity, such that returns on individual exposures are more heavily correlated. For example, in\na portfolio where 10% of total exposure can be attributed to a single name, a large shock to this name could mean at least 10% of\nthe portfolio could default at any one time.\nTo quantify the level of name concentration within a portfolio, we must calculate the portfolio value distribution at a given\nhorizon. Instrument valuation is conducted to give a distribution of each instrument’s value at horizon. The probability of realising\na given value translates to the credit quality of the name, simulated as asset returns. The Monte Carlo engine simulates asset\nreturns for each name within a portfolio, capturing correlations between each name in the portfolio via the systematic\ncomponent, dependent on the specified correlation model.8\nAs stated in Section 2.1, asset returns are a combination of a systematic and a firm-specific component. The firm-specific risk, or\nidiosyncratic risk, is the key element in quantifying name concentration. A large, idiosyncratic shock to a heavily-weighted,\nindividual counterparty inside an imperfectly granular portfolio can deteriorate the borrower’s credit quality, leading to default\nand, consequently, large losses. Due to the high weighting of this borrower inside the portfolio, the total portfolio loss distribution\ncan be greatly impacted, such that economic capital increases. If this large, single counterparty is broken up into smaller and less-\nconcentrated counterparties with the same risk profiles, such that each name contains the identical systematic risk exposure, the\ncollection of names will have the same systematic risk posed by the state of the economy, ensuring country or industry\nconcentration remains the same and is not included in the name concentration analysis. However, they each have unique,\nidiosyncratic shocks, so we do not expect this collection of names to default together at any one time, reducing the probability of\nlarge losses. As we continue to break up each name in the portfolio to the point of achieving an infinitely granular portfolio, the\nrandom, idiosyncratic component is eventually fully diversified. The asset return of a single name is then dependent only on the\nsystematic risk, and we see a much smaller portion of defaults at any one time.\nWe isolate individual, firm-specific risk by utilising the results of the Monte Carlo simulation, with the number of simulation trials\nstated pre-simulation.\nFigure 2 Instrument return for a given custom index.\nFigure 2 shows the return of an instrument in a number of individual simulation trials, given the drawn systematic component for\nthat trial. The purpose is to illustrate how the idiosyncratic component impacts individual instrument values. An individual\ninstrument’s return is a function of its systematic and idiosyncratic component (shown in Equation 1). For a given systematic\ncomponent draw, the volatility in instrument return is largely a consequence of the individual idiosyncratic component (in a case\n8 For further details on the Moody’s Analytics credit portfolio framework, see “An Overview of Modeling Credit Portfolios.” Moody’s Analytics, January 2021.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 7with no LGD variance). If we diversify away the risk from the idiosyncratic component, we see a smoothed line, such that the value\nis now purely dependent on the systematic component (for a given risk profile), and we see lower return values only in scenarios\nencompassing the worst possible market conditions to which the name is exposed.\nMonte Carlo simulation provides trial-by-trial instrument values that are dependent on this systematic, , and idiosyncratic,\ncomponent. We adjust the values into instrument returns, and using these with individual trial-by-trial factors draws to build the\nsystematic component, we run a regression analysis to remove this idiosyncratic component, such that i𝜙𝜙ns𝑖𝑖 trument returns are𝜀𝜀 n𝑖𝑖,o\nlonger impacted by the firm-specific risk. As the relationship between the systematic factor and returns is not linear, we regress\nthe instrument returns on a polynomial of the systematic factor. We find the optimum order in terms of speed and performance\nto be of order four. The estimate from the regression after removing the residual impact is as follows:\n1 2 3 4\n𝑟𝑟�𝚤𝚤 =𝛽𝛽0+𝜙𝜙�𝑖𝑖𝛽𝛽1+𝜙𝜙�𝑖𝑖𝛽𝛽2+𝜙𝜙�𝑖𝑖𝛽𝛽3+𝜙𝜙�𝑖𝑖𝛽𝛽4 (4)\nIdiosyncratic risk is now removed from each of the individual instrument trial returns within the portfolio. After converting these\nreturns back into values, these can be summed to obtain a distribution of portfolio values at horizon, from which we can obtain\nportfolio economic capital without name concentration at a given target probability. We leverage our framework for calculating\neconomic capital.9\n2.3 Country and Industry Concentration\nThe effects of country and industry concentration are rooted in the systematic component of the asset return. When a large\nportion of a portfolio is exposed to the same primary country or industry, their systematic components will be heavily correlated.\nIf this segment performs poorly, then it is likely a number of borrowers within this large portion of the portfolio will default, and\nthe portfolio can experience high losses. There is more complexity in distinguishing shocks that an individual factor may have\nencountered, as the systematic component is a combination of a number of factors. Consequently, we use a different method to\nquantify segment concentration. To understand the process of quantifying segment concentration in a portfolio, it is first\nbeneficial to discuss the consequence of segment concentrations within a portfolio, the “concentration effect.”\nTo describe concentration effect, consider a portfolio in which each exposure can be attributed to a specific segment (for instance,\neither a certain country or industry). In our case, we take the segment with the highest factor weight to which the instrument is\nexposed (the borrower’s primary country or industry). As an example, we use the Pharmaceuticals industry. An initial capital\ncharge is allocated to Pharmaceuticals after running a portfolio simulation. If we run a second simulation after increasing all the\nexposures within the Pharmaceuticals segment by the same amount (thus increasing concentration of the segment), we see an\nincrease in the size of the capital charge. The size of the increase depends on the concentration level. We describe two cases:\n» If we increase the size of each exposure in this segment by a small amount, while keeping the rest of the portfolio constant,\nsuch that the portfolio remains unconcentrated in this segment, we find this segment’s capital charge increases roughly\nlinearly with the size of the exposure increase.\n» If we increase the size of each exposure in this segment by a larger amount, while keeping the rest of the portfolio constant,\nsuch that the portfolio now has some concentration in that segment, we find that this segment’s capital charge increases\nmore than linearly with the size of the exposure increase.\nIf the increase causes a concentration, the losses will be great enough that the shape of the portfolio loss distribution will be\nimpacted. Extreme losses within this segment are more likely to be in the tail region, driving portfolio capital. Thus, the capital\nallocated to this segment via a tail-risk contribution is larger than beyond the initial increase in segment size. On the other hand, if\nwe diversify the portfolio and invest the extra notional into names exposed to new segments, the shocks that caused extreme\nlosses in the previously discussed segment do not impact the new segments included, reducing the impact on the overall portfolio\nloss distribution and diversifying away some of the systematic risk.\n9 Jimmy Huang, et al., “Modeling Credit Portfolios.” Moody’s Analytics, May 2015.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 8The knowledge of these non-linear concentration effects allows us to manipulate the portfolio loss distribution, such that we can\nisolate each individual segment, in turn, to approximate the capital for that segment as if the portfolio has no concentration. For\nexample, we can eliminate the concentration effects of a segment from the portfolio simply by removing that segment from the\nportfolio loss distribution, as we know that if a portfolio is unconcentrated in a segment, then that segment does not impact the\nportfolio loss distribution.10\nUsing simulation trial value output after removing name concentration effects — so that there is no impact of name\nconcentrations affecting the results — means we can aggregate segment trial values, analysing either country or industry at one\ntime.\n𝑅𝑅̃𝐻𝐻1,,𝑅𝑅̃𝐻𝐻2,…,𝑅𝑅̃𝐻𝐻𝐶𝐶|𝐼𝐼 𝐶𝐶 ≤49,𝐼𝐼 ≤61 (5)\nHere, C and I represent country and industry, respectively. An individual segment’s trial values can be isolated ( ), while the other\nsegments’ trial values are summed to give the portfolio value distribution ( ). By doing so, we can calculate the portfolio loss\ndistribution without the impact of the segment, or, put differently, we can remove the effects that a\nconcentrat𝑅𝑅̃ i𝐻𝐻\non in that\nsegment would create. From the loss distribution, we can calculate the\nunc𝑉𝑉o�𝐻𝐻\nncentrated capital of the segment, leveraging our\nframework for capital allocation.11 From this point onwards, references to portfolio values or capital will assume the effects of the\nsegment have been removed.\nWe now have two horizon value distributions:\n𝑅𝑅̃𝐻𝐻,𝑉𝑉�𝐻𝐻 (6)\nFor economic capital calculations, we are concerned with adverse portfolio outcomes, so these value distributions are translated\ninto loss distributions. Here, loss is defined as the difference between the realised values in (6) and a chosen loss reference point\n( ). The loss reference point may be chosen as the expected value (loss in excess of expected loss), or the risk-free grown value\n(loss in excess of total spread).\n𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿\n𝐿𝐿\n𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 =𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿−𝑉𝑉�𝐻𝐻 (7)\nWe can now use this information to approximate the capital allocation for a segment when the portfolio is unconcentrated in that\nsegment. For that, we use capital allocation by tail-risk contribution (TRC), and we first calculate portfolio capital, , which\nsatisfies the following: 𝐿𝐿\n𝐶𝐶\n𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿 𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑟𝑟𝑧𝑧−𝐿𝐿𝑃𝑃 𝐻𝐻\n𝑃𝑃[𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 ≥𝐶𝐶 (1+𝑟𝑟𝐻𝐻 ) ]=𝛼𝛼 (8)\nwhere is a given target probability, and is the risk-free rate to horizon, .\n𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑟𝑟𝑧𝑧−𝐿𝐿𝑃𝑃\n𝛼𝛼 𝑟𝑟𝐻𝐻 𝐻𝐻\nOnce the portfolio capital has been calculated, we evaluate the expected present value of losses of the unconcentrated segment\nwithin an interval surrounding portfolio capital — a lower bound and an upper bound is specified:\n𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿\n𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿\n𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑆𝑆−𝑅𝑅̃𝐻𝐻 𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿\n𝑇𝑇𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆 = 𝐸𝐸�� 𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆 �∙𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷�𝐶𝐶𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 <(𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐 𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)∙𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 <𝐶𝐶𝑈𝑈𝐿𝐿� (9)\nwhere denotes the discount factor.\n𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷\n10 For proof of the non-linear concentration effects, see “Calculating Capital Charges for Sector Concentration Risk,” Journal of Credit Risk, July 2018.\n11 Jimmy Huang, et al., “Modeling Credit Portfolios.” Moody’s Analytics, May 2015.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 9This gives us the tail-risk contribution of the segment, , when the portfolio has no concentration in that segment. This process\ncan be repeated for each segment within the portfolio to obtain the tail-risk contribution for each unconcentrated segment, so\nsegment capital can be estimated by multiplying the\nun𝑇𝑇c𝑅𝑅on𝐶𝐶c𝑆𝑆\nentrated portfolio capital by the ratio of weighted to the weighted\nsum of all in the portfolio.\n𝑇𝑇𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆\n𝑇𝑇𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆\n𝑆𝑆 𝑤𝑤𝑆𝑆∙𝑇𝑇𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆 𝐿𝐿\n𝐶𝐶 = 𝐶𝐶 (10)\nThese unconcentrated segment capitals, , can be simply su∑m𝑤𝑤m𝑆𝑆 e∙d𝑇𝑇 t𝑅𝑅o 𝐶𝐶re𝑆𝑆 ach the total portfolio capital value estimation in the\ncase of the portfolio having no concentrati𝑆𝑆ons in any given segment.\n𝐶𝐶\nWhen removing a segment’s influence from the portfolio, removing its concentration, the loss distribution of the portfolio is\ndriven by the other segments. What we expect to see depends on how concentrated the portfolio originally was in the segment\nprior to its removal.\n» Originally unconcentrated in a given segment: When removing the impact of the segment, the portfolio loss distribution\nremains largely unaffected. The interval used in tail-risk allocation remains mostly the same, and, therefore, any changes\nin capital allocation are marginal.\n» Originally concentrated in a given segment: When removing the impact of the segment, the shape of the portfolio loss\ndistribution changes, such that, the interval surrounding the unconcentrated portfolio capital is now a different set of\nsimulation trials. The tail risk-allocation reduces, as we are no longer using the trials containing the large losses (the given\nsegment’s losses previously drove the tail of the loss distribution). We also see the unconcentrated portfolio capital\nreduce in-line with the removal of that segment’s large losses.\nThese are the two basic scenarios we expect to see when removing the concentration of a certain segment. There may be times\nwhere we see an increase in capital allocation of a segment when removing concentration effects. This can happen if a particular\nsegment’s loss values have a positive impact on portfolio loss distribution (negative loss values), such that, by removing this\nsegment from the portfolio, we actually see an increase in losses within the tail region of the distribution. On a portfolio-level, we\nexpect to see an overall reduction in economic capital. However, on a segment-level, the allocation of capital can experience an\nincrease or decrease.\nThe advantage to this approach of removing the segment from the portfolio loss distribution to understand the concentration\nimpact is that, we maintain the portfolio’s overall risk profile, such that we can isolate the concentration effect inside the portfolio\nwithout making changes to portfolio construction. This way, we can decompose economic capital into its constituent,\nconcentration counterparts robustly, without running additional portfolio simulations.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 103. Data\nThis section outlines the composition of the portfolios used in the analyses. It provides a snapshot of the risk profiles and\nhighlights the most heavily-weighted counterparties or segments by notional, from which we can gain intuition into the levels of\ncapital relief we may see when removing concentration effects. For segment concentration, we provide a larger focus on the\nportfolio composition by industry, as we further examine these industries later in the paper.\n3.1 Portfolio Statistics\nTable 1 details differences among the three example portfolios we use to decompose the concentration risk. For the purpose of\nthis study, the risk profile of all exposures within each portfolio is homogeneous, with each name in the portfolio having the same\nvalue for probability of default, PD, loss given default, LGD,(assuming no LGD variance), and RSQ. By maintaining such\nhomogeneity within the portfolios, we can explore concentration effects without any influence of underlying risk characteristics, as\nthey impact the level of capital attributed to name or segment concentration.\nTable 1 Summary Statistics for Example Portfolios\nRISK STATISTICS PORTFOLIO A PORTFOLIO B PORTFOLIO C\nNotional USD 6bn USD 6bn USD 6bn\nNo. of Exposures 6,000 6,000 6,000\nNo. of Counterparties 2,000 2,000 2,000\nNo. of Industries 10 10 30\nNo. of Countries 10 10 25\nPD 1.4 % 1.4% 1.4%\nLGD 40.5% 40.5% 40.5%\nRSQ 40.0% 40.0% 40.0%\nThe 10 largest exposures account for: 20.2% of Total Notional 6.2% of Total Notional 6.2% of Total Notional\nAll three portfolios contain the same number of exposures and counterparties. Portfolio A represents the most concentrated\nportfolio case; it differs from Portfolio B purely by exposure weights.\nTable 2 shows further portfolio risk characteristics, namely the weights of the five largest counterparties (by notional). It is\nimmediately evident that Portfolio A contains much larger single name exposures than Portfolios B or C. We expect to see the\nlargest overall economic capital for Portfolio A, with the highest contributors shown in Table 2. Also, this portfolio should provide\nthe largest capital relief when removing the effects of name concentration. Portfolio C differs from Portfolio B only by the number\nof industries and countries to which the portfolio is exposed, allowing us to better understand the segment concentration effects.\nTable 2 Five Largest Counterparties by Notional\nCOUNTERPARTY PORTFOLIO A PORTFOLIO B PORTFOLIO C\nRF_002535 7.5% 1.2% 1.2%\nRF_002824 5% 1.1% 1.1%\nRF_011311 2.5% 0.9% 0.9%\nRF_011659 2.5% 0.5% 0.5%\nRF_015389 2.5% 0.5% 0.5%\nTable 3 shows the weights of the five largest industries (by notional). Again, Portfolio A exhibits larger concentrations, with 58% of\ntotal notional exposed to just five industries. This value reduces to 51.7% in Portfolio B and 22.7% in Portfolio C. It follows that we\nhypothesise the level of capital relief due to segment concentration will also decrease from Portfolio A to C.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 11Table 3 Five Largest Industries by Notional\nPORTFOLIO A PORTFOLIO B PORTFOLIO C\nWEIGHT WEIGHT WEIGHT\nINDUSTRY INDUSTRY INDUSTRY\nAS % OF TOTAL AS % OF TOTAL AS % OF TOTAL\nNOTIONAL NOTIONAL NOTIONAL\nBANKS AND S&LS 15% TEXTILES 11.5% APPAREL & SHOES 5.2%\nTEXTILES 15% BANKS AND S&LS 10.4% AIR TRANSPORTATION 4.7%\nBUSINESS SERVICES 10% AIR TRANSPORTATION 10.0% MEDICAL EQUIPMENT 4.4%\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS\n10% APPAREL & SHOES 10.0% AEROSPACE & DEFENSE 4.2%\nRETL/WHSL\nAIR TRANSPORTATION 8% BUSINESS SERVICES 9.8% CHEMICALS 4.2%\nFigure 3 Industry composition.\nFigure 3 displays the industry compositions of the three portfolios by notional; both Portfolio A and B contain ten unique\nindustries. However, note that, although we maintain the same number of industries and countries in the two portfolios, as we\nspread notional more evenly among counterparties, we also alter the weights of exposure to each segment, giving a more even\nexposure between the different factors. This is why, in Portfolio A, both segments Banks and S&Ls and Textiles have a noticeably\nlarger weight than other segments. Portfolio C is exposed to 25 equally-weighted industries, and, with a larger segment exposure,\nthe number of custom indexes (the combination of country-industry segment an individual name is exposed to) increases further.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 124. Results\nThe effects of both name and segment concentration can be viewed at a portfolio level as well as a more granular level, allowing\nfor a better strategic understanding of the sources of concentration within a portfolio. This section contains a decomposition of\nportfolio economic capital for the three example portfolios presented in Section 3. We illustrate how concentrations can make a\nportfolio riskier. To further understand the effects of concentration within a portfolio, we provide a more detailed analysis on\nsingle name and segment concentration.\nWhile it is important to quantify and decompose concentration risk within a portfolio, it is also beneficial to understand how to\nmanage these risks and design strategies to enhance portfolio performance. The final part of this section provides such analysis.\nWe discuss mispricing in a portfolio context and show how to arrive at optimal or improved portfolio allocations when removing\nconcentration. We also conduct a risk-based limit exercise that may be used to adhere to a financial institution’s risk appetite\nstatement. These exercises enable an organisation to make informed decisions about which borrowers or segments may be the\nmost beneficial to reduce exposure and where to redistribute notional.\n4.1 Decomposing Portfolio Economic Capital\nIn assessing the performance of the above-described portfolios without name and segment concentration, we look at one of the key\nportfolio-level RiskFrontier outputs: economic capital calculated at 10 bps target probability.\nTable 4 Portfolio-level Results\nPORTFOLIO A PORTFOLIO B PORTFOLIO C\nNotional $6 bn $6 bn $6 bn\nRISK OUTPUTS TOTAL RELIEF TOTAL RELIEF TOTAL RELIEF\nOriginal $471 mil - $405 mil - $337 mil -\nEconomic No Name Concentration $423 mil -10% $400 mil -1% $334 mil -1%\nCapital No Name and No Industry Concentration $375 mil -20% $362 mil -11% $321 mil -5%\nNo Name and No Country Concentration $370 mil -21% $360 mil -11% $316 mil -6%\nTable 4 first shows the original economic capital of each of the three portfolios. The rows below give the economic capital that\nremains after removing name concentration effects, and after removing either name and industry or name and country\nconcentration effects. The relief column shows the decrease in capital from the original value. As expected, all three portfolios\nshow lower economic capital when removing either type of concentration risk, but the magnitude of the decrease varies.\nFigure 4 Portfolio economic capital decomposition.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 13Figure 4 provides a visual representation of the overall decomposition of economic capital at the portfolio level. Each bar’s total\nrepresents the economic capital of the respective portfolio. The green and light blue portions of each bar give the capital relief we\nsee if we remove the effects of industry concentration or name concentration, respectively, whilst the dark blue portion of each\nbar is the remaining economic capital. We see the highest level of capital relief for Portfolio A, as it is the most concentrated\nportfolio in both name and segment terms, with 20% of total notional residing in just 10 counterparties and exposure to only 10\ndifferent countries and industries; here, total capital relief equates to $96 million (20% of total portfolio capital). The capital is\nlower for Portfolio B, as the notional is more evenly weighted across counterparties (6% of total notional resides in 10\ncounterparties). We observe lower capital relief after removing name concentration effects than we do for Portfolio A. There is still\nroom for further name diversification benefits, however, as we still see a capital relief of $5 million when removing name\nconcentration. With 6% of notional in just 10 counterparties, one could expect to see a larger benefit of removing name\nconcentration. However, as the average weight of counterparties inside the portfolio is just 0.05%, the portfolio is heavily skewed\nin terms of notional to a small number of counterparties; in a portfolio where each of the constituent counterparties accounts for\na very small portion of total notional, we expect to see very little, if any, name concentration diversification benefits.\nPortfolio C is the least-concentrated portfolio, and we observe the smallest capital relief when removing concentration. Name and\nindustry concentration effects account for $3 million and $16 million, respectively, or 1% and 5% of total capital. We see a\ndifferent name concentration capital relief for Portfolio C than for Portfolio B despite the number of counterparties and their\nweights across the portfolios are the same. In Portfolio C, the counterparties have more country and industry pairings, which\nreduces the correlation between borrowers in the portfolio; the portfolio also has lower undiversified capital. This difference in\nundiversified capital arises from increased exposure to a wider set of country and industry factors — a large number of\ncombinations of factors leads to more diversification in the portfolio. There are 486 unique combinations of country and industry\nfactors that a Portfolio C counterparty may be exposed to, in comparison to only 100 different such combinations in Portfolios A\nand B.\nTo further understand the change in total capital between portfolios of varying concentration levels, Figure 5 shows the\ndistribution of loss values, with a focus on the tail regions, with the dashed lines representing the capital value for each portfolio\n(red for Portfolio A, green for Portfolio B, and blue for Portfolio C). The most concentrated portfolio displays the fattest tail, a fact\nthat indicates a relatively higher probability of large losses. However, if we break up the concentrated areas it is less likely that a\nlarge group of counterparties will all default at the same time; this is why we observe the lowest probability of extreme losses in\nPortfolio C.\nFigure 5 Portfolio loss distribution.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 144.2 Single Name Analysis\nTo explore the consequences of name concentration at the most granular level, we investigate an individual name that accounts\nfor 8.5% of the total notional of Portfolio A, which makes it the most concentrated name in that portfolio. The portfolio is\nsimulated in this initial state — Case Number 1. We then split the name into 3, 15, 30, 300, and 3,000 separate names. By doing\nso, we can understand why having name concentrations can be detrimental to portfolio performance.\nTable 5 Portfolio-level Results\nCASE NO. TOTAL NO. OF NAMES UNEXPECTED LOSS RELIEF W.R.T ECONOMIC CAPITAL (TRC) RELIEF W.R.T\nIN THE PORTFOLIO CASE NO. 6 CASE NO. 6\n1 1 $57.958 mil -7.7% $471 mil -8.5%\n2 3 $55.059 mil -2.4% $443 mil -2.1%\n3 15 $54.014 mil -0.4% $439 mil -1.2%\n4 30 $53.829 mil -0.07% $437 mil -0.7%\n5 300 $53.792 mil -0.004% $436 mil -0.5%\n6 3,000 $53.790 mil - $434 mil -\nTable 5 shows the unexpected loss (UL) and economic capital on a portfolio level, after the reduction of concentration in the single\nname. The relief column shows the percentage decrease from Cases 1−5 to the most unconcentrated case (when the name has\nbeen split into 3,000 identical names i.e., Case Number 6). For instance, the capital relief for Case Number 3 is calculated by\n($434-$439)/$434. We see that concentration in a single name can have a great impact on overall portfolio capital and the\nstandard deviation of losses. As we reduce this concentration and the name becomes almost perfectly granular, the impact\nweakens, and the idiosyncratic effects fade away.\nFigure 6 Economic capital (tail-risk contribution-based capital allocation).\nFigure 6 shows how both total portfolio capital and tail-risk allocated capital12 decrease when splitting a single name into 3,000\ndifferent names of equivalent risk profile. Each bar’s total represents the value of portfolio economic capital (also given in Table 5).\nThe light blue portion represents the capital allocation either to the single name or to the 3,000 names.\nThis name originally makes up 21% of total portfolio capital; this percentage decreases to 8.4% when the name is split into 3,000\nidentically-profiled names. Originally, the default of this name would lead to large losses and drive the tail region of the portfolio\nloss distribution, due to its large weight within the portfolio. After this split, the systematic component remains the same\nthroughout these counterparties for each individual trial of the simulation, but the idiosyncratic component is unique to each\n12 Risk Contribution-based capital allocation displays a very similar relationship to tail-risk contribution-based capital allocation when removing the name\nconcentration effects.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 15counterparty. Therefore, where we may have previously experienced a default due to a large shock, we now only expect to see a\nportion of these counterparties defaulting at any one time as the shocks vary between counterparties. As we split each issuer\ninside a portfolio into a larger number of names, we eventually approach an infinitely granular portfolio — one in which we have\nremoved all name concentration effects — and the risk posed by the idiosyncratic component is diversified away. The tail-risk\ncontribution also decreases significantly, as now other names within the portfolio are driving losses in the tail.\nNot only does the process of removing name concentration in a portfolio impact the tail region of the loss distribution by accruing\nmuch smaller losses at any one time, the variance in portfolio values also decreases, leading to a reduction in portfolio UL. To\nbetter illustrate this reduced variance effect at a name level, Figure 7 shows the range of simulated instrument values for a range\nof systematic factor values. The black line gives the instrument value for a given custom index value when we fully diversify away\nthe idiosyncratic risk in the portfolio. The purple shaded area shows the range of instrument values attained in simulation trials.\nThe chart on the left shows a split into 300 while the one on the right into 3,000 identical names.\nWe see a much larger range in simulated instrument values for the case with 300 names, where the difference between maximum\nand minimum values is $23 million. After increasing the number of counterparties to 3,000 names, the range in values becomes\nmore closely centered around the mean, and the randomness in simulated values decreases. Here, the range between maximum\nand minimum instrument value is just $10.7 million.\nFigure 7 Instrument value range for a given custom index.\nAs the variance in simulated values is reduced, the counterparties’ contribution to the volatility of overall portfolio value\ndecreases. Not only does portfolio UL drop due to the reduced randomness of values, the randomness in portfolio values is now\nbeing driven predominantly by other counterparties within the portfolio. The correlation between counterparty and portfolio\nvalues is greatly reduced, and the capital allocated via the risk-contribution method decreases. If we remove the name\nconcentration from every name within the portfolio, the randomness in the simulation will be driven purely by the systematic\ncomponent.\n4.3 Capital Decomposition by Different Segments\nThis section explores the decomposition of economic capital at a segment level, developing an understanding of why some\nsegments may see larger capital relief when removing concentration.\nFigures 8 and 9 show the capital relief of each segment for Portfolios A and C, where capital is allocated by tail-risk contribution.\nEach bar represents total capital allocation; the dark portion gives the capital remaining after removing the effects of industry\nconcentration and the light blue portion gives the amount of capital relief achieved. Overall, we observe lower capital relief for\nportfolio C after removing industry concentration. From Table 4, we see that we reduce the capital required for Portfolio A by\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 16roughly 10% in comparison to just 4% for Portfolio C. Looking back at Figure 3, we see that not only is Portfolio C exposed to a\nlarger spread of industries compared to Portfolio A (30 unique industries, in contrast to 10 unique industries in Portfolio A), but\nalso the notional weights are more evenly distributed among industries. The two most heavily-weighted industries in Portfolio A —\nBanks and S&Ls and Textiles — account for 30% of the portfolio notional.\nFigure 8 reveals that the size of individual industry capital relief follows that of each industry weight, shown in Table 3. The Banks\nand S&Ls and Textiles segments experience the largest reductions in capital when removing concentration effects, followed by\nBusiness Services and Consumer Products Retl/Whsl. The total portfolio capital relief is $48 million — combined, the Banks and\nS&Ls and Textiles segments make up 63.2% of this amount.\nFigure 8 Capital decomposition by segment — Portfolio A.\nFigure 9 Capital decomposition by segment — Portfolio C.\nThe trend occurs due to the large disparities in notionals in these segments. Figure 9 shows that, when the notional weights\nbetween segments are equal, Banks and S&Ls, Textiles, and other previously mentioned segments no longer stand out as having\nlarger capital allocations or relief. It is purely the concentration effects that cause the large capital allocations in Portfolio A. Note\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 17that, per Figure 8, the capital allocation after removing name concentration for both Banks and S&Ls and Textiles is almost\nequivalent. However, we observe a much larger reduction in capital for the former segment after removing industry concentration\neffects. To understand why this occurs, we further investigate these two segments; Figure 10 shows the total capital\ndecomposition for both.\nFigure 10 Capital decomposition by segment.\nThe total of each bar gives the initial tail-risk capital allocation for each segment — $127 million for Banks and S&Ls and $93 million\nfor Textiles. Note, this large difference in allocation, given that both segments make up 15% of the portfolio notional. If we look\ndeeper into the portfolio set-up, we can see that, within the Banks and S&Ls segment, there is a single counterparty making up\n48.4% of notional, whereas, within the Textiles segment, this portion is shared by two counterparties that make up 32% and 16%\nof the notional. The single name analysis section of this paper describes how splitting up a single, large-weighted name can have a\ngreat impact on economic capital allocation. A simultaneous default of the two largest counterparties is less likely than a single\ndefault within the Banks and S&Ls segment, and we see a lower probability of high losses inside the Textiles segment. After removing\nthese effects of name concentration, we can see a very similar capital allocation.\nFigure 11 shows the distribution of each segment’s losses within the tail-risk interval, before and after removing the effects of\nindustry concentration. The dark blue box plots show the distribution within the interval of Portfolio A. The light blue box plots\nshow the distribution within the interval after removing the effects of industry concentration, i.e. the losses within the interval that\nwould occur if the portfolio loss distribution was unaffected by that segment. The dots inside the plots show the mean value of\neach distribution. The Banks and S&Ls segment has a larger range of values within the original “concentrated” interval, showing\nmore extreme losses while the losses in the Textiles segment are centered more closely around the mean. Despite this difference\nin value range, the average values within the concentrated intervals have a percentage difference of just 0.25%, and the capital\nallocation is similar.\nWe observe a noticeable difference in the range of values before and after removing concentration from the Banks and S&Ls\nsegment. The interval of the original portfolio loss distribution contains several trials of losses exceeding $200mil within this\nsegment. However, after we remove the impact of this segment on the portfolio loss distribution, the interval moves to a region in\nwhich other segments' losses are driving the tail, and we no longer see this amount of extreme values from this segment. This\nobservation suggests that the extreme losses of exposures within this segment drive the portfolio loss distribution tail — after\nremoving this segment, the interval changes to a position in which the losses of the segment are no longer as significant.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 18Figure 11 Losses in capital interval — before and after removing industry concentration.\nFigure 12 Losses exceeding $100mil in the Banks and S&Ls and Textiles segments.\nFigure 12 shows the distribution of losses exceeding $100mil within the Banks and S&LS and Textiles segments. It illustrates the\nreason the Banks and S&Ls segment is the key driver in the tail of the portfolio loss distribution, despite having the same notional\nweight as the Textiles segment — the Banks and S&Ls segment has a higher probability of extreme losses. When the impact of the\nBanks and S&LS segment is removed from the portfolio, large losses of other segments now drive the tail and the shape of the\nportfolio loss distribution changes; large losses of this segment within the new TRC interval are much less common. While there\nare occurrences of losses exceeding $175mil within the Textiles segment, when we remove the impact of the Textiles segment,\nthere is only a small movement in the shape of the portfolio loss distribution, as the tail is being predominantly driven by the\nBanks and S&LS segment.\nTo summarise, although the portfolio is exposed to the same notional weight of these two industries, concentration within the\nBanks and S&LS is a greater risk to the portfolio performance due to the potential for large losses. This is why we see a greater\ncapital relief within this segment when removing concentration effects.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 194.4 Strategic Portfolio Planning\nUtilising these exercises, portfolio managers can understand and quantify the concentration risks in their portfolios robustly, and,\nbased on the risk-return profile of their portfolios and segments, they can design portfolio strategies to set risk based-limits13 and\ndetermine optimal asset allocation. This approach can help institutions adhere to their risk appetite framework, while optimising\ntheir portfolio investment strategy. By reviewing these exercises after concentration effects have been removed, an organisation\ncan make informed, strategic decisions as to which exposures it could be most beneficial to reduce concentrations in.\nFigure 13 shows the Vasicek-mispricing (or TRC-based mispricing) of industries within Portfolio A, and how mispricing changes\nafter removing name or industry concentration. The triangular icons represent the Vasicek-mispricing of each industry, and the\nslope of the line is the portfolio’s Vasicek ratio. Points to the left side of the line indicate positive mispricing, while points to the\nright indicate negative mispricing. In a portfolio optimised to yield a maximum Vasicek ratio, exposure weight would be adjusted\nso that all points line up along and close to the Vasicek ratio line. In reality, however, we optimise a portfolio by shifting weights of\nexposures whose points fall in the negatively mispriced group to those in the positively mispriced group. The reason we see an\nequal expected spread between industries is due to the equal risk profile (having the same PD, LGD, and RSQ values) of each\nexposure in the portfolio.\nWe can see from the plot of the original portfolio that industries are much more spread out in terms of differing capitalisation\nrates and, thus, some industries display positive mispricing, while two industries in particular are quite negatively mispriced: the\nBanks and S&Ls and Textiles segments. To optimise the risk-return profile of the portfolio, we should reduce concentration within\nthese two segments and redistribute this notional into the other, all positively-mispriced segments. By reducing concentration\nwithin these two segments, we reduce the portfolio economic capital and improve the risk-return ratio. This point is further\nsupported by the fact that, in the mispricing chart where the portfolio has no impacts of concentration, these two industries still\ndisplay negative mispricing. The industries displaying the most positive mispricing are the Utilities, Electric and Air Transportation\nsegments. Portfolio performance can be improved if notional is redistributed to exposures within these industries.\nAfter removing name and, subsequently, industry concentration, we see an improvement in the Vasicek ratio of the portfolio as\nthe slope of the line gets steeper, due to the reduction in economic capital. The mispricing of all industries moves closer to the\nportfolio Vasicek ratio. Although, technically, we have not adjusted the exposure weights within the portfolio, by removing the\neffects of concentration we theoretically break up the weights of each counterparty/industry/country into smaller pieces\n(removing the concentration within those segments), which, in turn, reduces each individual component’s capital, improving the\nportfolio’s risk-return profile. Table 6 shows the improvement in Vasicek ratio for each of the three portfolios. When removing the\neffects of name and segment concentration, it is clear we experience a lower risk for a given expected return in all cases.\n13 Andrew Kaplin, et al., “Quantifying Risk Appetite in Limit Setting.” Moody’s Analytics, June 2015.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 20Figure 13 Vasicek-mispricing of industries within Portfolio A.\nTable 6 Vasicek Ratio\nPORTFOLIO A PORTFOLIO B PORTFOLIO C\nNotional $6 bn $6 bn $6 bn\nRISK OUTPUTS TOTAL INCREASE TOTAL INCREASE TOTAL INCREASE\nOriginal 0.133 - 0.155 - 0.186 -\nNo Name Concentration 0.148 11% 0.157 1% 0.187 1%\nVasicek Ratio\nNo Name and No Industry Concentration 0.167 26% 0.173 12% 0.196 5%\nNo Name and No Country Concentration 0.169 27% 0.174 12% 0.198 6%\nA financial institution may want to define risk-based limits, adhering to firm strategy and stakeholders’ risk appetite. There are a\nnumber of ways to translate an institution’s risk appetite framework into risk-based, sub-portfolio limits. Here, we explore\nportfolio-referent sub-portfolio risk limits that consider the risk of a segment in the context of a portfolio. These limits incorporate\nthe idea that riskier segments are likely to incur substantial losses when the portfolio performs poorly, so that segments that\ncontribute more to large portfolio losses face a tighter limit.\nCapital may be allocated via either a tail-risk contribution-based or a risk contribution (RC)-based measure, specific to an\ninstitution’s risk preference. Here, we focus on an RC-based risk allocation. Figure 14 shows the proportion of portfolio notional\nand UL owing to each industry in the portfolio. The light blue bar refers to the segment RC (% of portfolio UL) prior to removing\nname concentration. The dark blue bar refers to the segment RC after removing name concentration. Focusing on the original\nportfolio results, the pattern in the relative proportion of notional and RC follows the distribution of notional weights shown in\nFigure 3; the more heavily-weighted segments have a larger RC allocation than the percent of holdings. Then, as the weights\ndecrease, we see segment RC become smaller in comparison to the holding amount. The Banks and S&Ls and Textiles segments\nboth have larger RC than notional percentage in the portfolio. This is due to the concentration effects, which is why, after\nremoving the name concentration of each name within the portfolio, segment RC declines significantly. The proportion of these\nsegments’ contribution to portfolio UL remains higher than the portion of notional, and much greater than other segments within\nthe portfolio, as there are still concentration effects occurring due to the high portion of notional in these segments. It is worth\nnoting that the Utilities, Electric segment shows the most striking disparity between notional proportion and the RC allocation,\nwith RC being roughly a third less than the notional allocation. Air Transportation also shows a similar relationship. The red dashed\nline in the graph gives the limit of risk we have set for this exercise; no segment should contribute more than 15% of portfolio UL.\nIn reality, we choose this limit in order to align with the organisation’s risk appetite.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 21Figure 14 Notional and risk contribution.\nTo define risk-based limits, it is important to understand the tradeoff between each individual segment’s risk and invested\nnotional. Figure 15 presents the relationship between the RC allocation for the 10 industries and their notional weight, before and\nafter removing name concentration effects, illustrating how each industry’s RC is impacted by increasing notional. Take Banks and\nS&Ls as an example. The weight of this sector in the portfolio is 15% and comprises 25% of the original portfolio UL (also shown\nin Figure 14). If this segment made up 100% of portfolio notional, the RC would represent portfolio UL. On the other hand, if there\nis no weight of that segment in the portfolio, the RC portion will equal 0. Again, we highlight the 15% of the portfolio risk limit\nwith a red dashed line.\nNotice how the relationship between RC and notional weight of the segments changes after removing name concentration. The\nnotional limits of the original portfolio vary between 10.6% (for Banks and S&Ls) and 19.7% (for Utilities, Electric). After removing\nname concentration, we see the limits ranging between 13.8% (for Textiles) and 16.7% (for Utilities, Electric). RC-based limits are\nimpacted by the characteristics of each segment. The portfolio we simulate is homogeneous in risk profile, so the notional-based\nlimits are being driven by the concentration risk. We see lower notional weight limits in the original portfolio, as we have larger\nconcentrations of names within these higher-weighted segments, which increases risk for a given total segment weight. After we\nremove the effects of name concentration from each segment, we find that weight limits for these segments have now increased,\nand we can allocate a larger portion of notional to these segments and still adhere to the risk limit.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 22Figure 15 Relationship between RC and the amount invested in a segment.\nTEXTILES\nBANKS AND S&LS\nUTILITIES, ELECTRIC\nTEXTILES\nUTILITIES, ELECTRIC\nThe notional limits of each industry become much more evenly spread after removing name concentration effects. Figure 16\nshows the current notional weight of each industry in the portfolio, as well as the risk-based notional limits before and after\nremoving name concentration. Note that the notional weight limit increases for just two industries, Banks and S&Ls and Textiles,\nwhereas we see a decrease in the limit for all other industries. This is because, after removing name concentration, these two\nheavily concentrated industries are largely reducing their risk contribution to the portfolio — the industries that previously had\nlittle name concentration now have more impact on the portfolio loss distribution. The previously unconcentrated industries\ncontribute more risk to the overall portfolio UL, so, for a given risk limit, we require less notional weight in the portfolio.\nFigure 16 shows that, after removing name concentration, to maintain a risk contribution allocation to each industry below 15% of\nportfolio UL, we must reduce the notional weight of both Banks and S&Ls and Textiles segments by 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\nSimilar to the mispricing exercise, we see a benefit in reducing concentrations within the Banks and S&Ls and Textiles segments, as\na reduction of 4.9% and 2.6% in notional weight is required for these segments in the original portfolio composition. By\nredistributing the notional to segments such as Utilities, Electric and Air Transportation, we see a more even spread of risk\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 23contribution in the portfolio and remain within the risk limits. Figure 16 shows it is possible to increase the exposures within\nUtilities, Electric and Air Transportation without violating the 15% limit on risk contribution.\nFigure 16 Notional weight limits.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 245. Summary\nThis paper illustrates a concentration risk quantification framework that can be used to decompose a portfolio’s economic capital,\nto view the effects the existing level of concentration has on the overall risk. In addition, the method quantifies the effect of\ndiversification on economic capital relief, while maintaining a portfolio’s risk profile, to isolate the impact of each source of\nconcentration in the portfolio. Offering analysis of concentration effects at varying levels of granularity, the approach enables the\nuser to investigate the impact on total portfolio economic capital or focus on individual names, country, or industry effects. This\nunique capability of our solution can be used by financial institutions to implement more diversified portfolio strategies that\nminimise potential losses, improve liquidity management and capital allocation, and yield better return-to-risk ratios.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 25References\nEuropean Banking Authority, “Final Report – Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring.” May 2020.\nHuang, Jimmy, et al. “Modeling Credit Portfolios.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, May 2015.\nInternational Association of Credit Portfolio Managers, “Principles and Practices, Credit Portfolio Management at the Tail End of\nthe Credit Cycle in CPM Survey.” IACMP, 2019.\nKaplin, Andrew, Amnon Levy, Qiang Meng, and Libor Pospisil, “Quantifying Risk Appetite in Limit Setting.” Moody’s Analytics, June\n2015.\nKurtz, Cornelius, Eva Lütkebohmert, and Julian Sester, “Calculating Capital Charges for Sector Concentration Risk.” Journal of Credit\nRisk, July 2018.\nLevy, Amnon, Masha Muzyka, and Pierre Hu, “Concentration Risk Consideration During the Allowance Process and COVID-19’s\nImpact.” Moody’s Analytics Whitepaper, April 2020.\nLevy, Amnon, Kamal Kumar, “An Overview of Modeling Credit Portfolios.” Moody’s Analytics, January 2021.\nOffice of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada, “Final Guideline B-2: Large Exposure Limits for D-SIBs,” 2019.\nOffice of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada,” Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) for Deposit-\nTaking Institutions,” 2010.\nOfficial Journal of the European Union, “Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November\n2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II).”\nUnited States Government Publishing Office , Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 85 / Tuesday, May 4, 2010 / Notices.\nXiao, Angela and Sara Jiang, “Understanding GCorr 2020 Corporate.” Moody’s Analytics, February 2021.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS QUANTIFYING, DECOMPOSING, AND MANAGING PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK 26© 2021 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
