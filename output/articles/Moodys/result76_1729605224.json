The OECD states that credit ratings serve as a\ninterest rate pricing tool to help meet the increased\nuseful measure of a borrower’s creditworthiness and are one of the main factors that\nindependent lenders take into account when determining interest rates.1 Further, the complexities involved in appropriately considering,\nOECD’s view is that the reliability of credit ratings that are derived from publicly available analyzing and documenting the arm’s length nature of\ntools is improved when the following criteria are met:\nintercompany financial transactions.\n1.

In 2019, as part of an\ninternal restructuring, Uber’s Singapore holding company advanced a USD 16 billion Industry/Market Customer power\nintercompany loan to its Dutch subsidiary to purchase some intellectual property within\nDiversification of products\nthe group. Naturally, the sheer quantum of this loan raised the tax risk associated with\nthis transaction. Determining an accurate and appropriate credit rating for Uber’s Dutch Company Years in relationship\nsubsidiary is paramount in arriving at an arm’s length interest rate for this loan.\nSupplier power\nTo demonstrate the importance of the credit rating in an intercompany loan\nConduct of account\narrangement, we consider the potential impact of different credit rating approaches for\nthe Dutch subsidiary Uber NL Holdings 1 B.V. (henceforth Uber NL) in taking out a 10- Management Experience in industry\nyear loan on December 2, 2019. Three different approaches are as follows:\nFinancial reporting and formal planning\n1. Group rating:3 The long-term agency rating by Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) for\nthe corporate group, Uber Technologies, Inc. as of December 2, 2019. Risk appetite\n2. Standalone rating: The PD-implied rating of the subsidiary Uber NL as of December\nBalance Sheet Factors Audit method\n2, 2019. This rating is determined using EDF-X’s pre-loaded quantitative data and\nrefined using qualitative analysis (including factors relating to the industry/market, Debtor risk / accounts receivable risk\ncompany, management, and balance sheet, shown in Table 1).\nPro-forma interest coverage\n3. Comprehensive rating: The PD-implied rating of the subsidiary Uber NL adjusted for\nimplicit support of the corporate group.4 This approach is considered most closely Pro-forma liquidity\naligned with OECD guidelines.\n3 The OECD notes that it may be appropriate to use the group rating if a standalone analysis is not reliable. 3\n4 Moody’s parent/group support framework is used to assess and quantify the impact of being part of the corporate group.Moody’s Analytics | ANALYTICS IN ACTION\nOnce a credit rating has been determined, EDF-X provides a simple interface to determine a credit spread according to origination date of the loan, tenor, currency, reference rate, and\nany potential additional costs5 (Figure 1).\nFigure 1 EDF-X inputs for determining credit spread\nThe output is a credit spread calibrated to a dataset of over 16,000 globally collected spreads between a credit rating of B2 and Caa-C of 67.74 basis points on a USD 16 billion\nMoody’s rated bonds that have been filtered by rigorous bond inclusion criteria.6 An 10-year loan would result in a difference of over USD 108 million in interest per year, or\neffective interest rate for a comparable loan can then be obtained by adding the spread potentially in excess of USD 1 billion over the term of the loan!\nto the corresponding reference rate.7\nEDF-X provides tax professionals with an objective, comprehensive, and transparent\nFor the Uber NL example, Table 2 shows the resulting credit spreads (denominated in credit risk and interest rate pricing tool to help meet the increased complexities involved\nEuro, taking a European Treasury yield as the reference rate8) across different ratings and in appropriately considering, analyzing, and documenting the arm’s length nature of\ntenors. Poorer ratings and longer tenors are generally associated with larger spreads, as intercompany financial transactions.\nexpected. Based on this analysis, even the relatively small difference in median credit\n5 Origination costs, overhead costs, margin, and other costs are directly added to the resulting credit spread.\n6 The PD range associated with each rating bucket is fairly consistent across countries, so integrating globally collected bonds into a single framework is practicable. An alternative to using bonds is using historical loan transaction data, which would allow for matching spreads\naccording to the size of the loan as well. However, transaction data on comparable loans are often limited and thus suffer from small sample bias. In contrast, the global bond universe is substantially larger. Bonds also have more standardized terms and offer updated pricing\nalong with greater liquidity.\n7 After the denominations of all bonds have been changed to USD, the spread is obtained as a value that is approximately representative of the median spread of all the bonds in the corresponding tenor-rating bucket. Finally, the spread is converted to its counterpart in the\nchosen currency (Euro in our example) by leveraging daily updated market-observed FX rates using the principle of interest rate parity along with a no-arbitrage condition.
