As we can see from Figure 1, 65% of respondents identified risk management as a key driver with 81% identifying\nmanaging reputational risk in particular. While we expected this given where many insurers are in their ESG journey, we were\nencouraged to see that one in three respondents also saw potential for unlocking new revenue opportunities. We believe that this\nnumber is likely to increase as insurers start to realize value and see the opportunities that they can derive from using ESG as an\nadditional risk factor in risk selection, pricing, and product development. Survey respondents were asked about the key drivers for\nintegrating ESG into their business and were able to select more than one answer.\nFigure 1 The key drivers for integrating ESG data\nPlans for ESG integration: speed is of the essence\nThese survey results offer a valuable insight into the importance insurers place on integrating ESG into the business. As seen in\nFigure 2, a clear majority are, at minimum, making progress on their ESG strategy.\nThis aligns with our observations from our wide market engagement of the speed of change in the industry. We have noted a\nsignificant increase in the number of insurers looking to obtain data and analytical platforms in order to integrate ESG into\nunderwriting over the last 12 months. In addition, insurers have also started to move beyond crude exclusionary approaches to\nmore holistic, balanced approaches to sustainability.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING ESG INTO PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND UNDERWRITING WORKFLOWS: THE STATE OF THE MARKET 3Figure 2 Status of ESG strategy\nTaking a phased approach to provide solid foundations for an ESG-centric business model\nOur conversations in the market suggest insurers have appetite for rapid progress in integrating ESG into the business. However it\nis imperative that insurers take an iterative, phased approach, rather than rushing towards full integration.\nThe first phase involves defining an insurer’s vision for sustainability and creating a strategy that, importantly, includes\nsustainability targets or commitments. Defining targets is critical to creating a vision that can be deployed throughout the\nbusiness. Insurers need rigor around any new data sets and to be able to understand the scores and data sets they use to build the\nscores.\nThe second phase requires companies to understand their current ESG footprint by performing an analysis of their insurance\nportfolio and measuring against a set of ESG metrics. Through this, they can identify areas of concern and develop strategies to\nimprove the overall ESG performance of the portfolio. At this stage they can also start the first iterations of defining ESG risk\nappetite and tolerances for the short and medium term.\nInsurers can use portfolio heatmaps to start reporting to stakeholders on the current position and the gap to the targets defined in\nphase 1. They can then communicate the strategy for achieving those targets and commitments. What-if scenarios on the\nportfolio, for example non-renewal of accounts, run-offs of business lines can help identify the best strategy.\nThey can also leverage these heatmaps to start thinking about their ‘own view’ of ESG risk, which utilizes third party and\nproprietary data, but reweights metrics based on the insurer’s own sensitivities and view around ESG risk. An insurer’s own view of\nrisk is central to its strategy and the development of this is crucial to its success.\nAt this stage, insurers can start investigating correlations between ESG risk and various other performance metrics, such as loss\nratios and claims data. Should correlations be identified, ESG factors can then be incorporated into pricing models, creating a new\nrisk dimension for underwriters.\nOnce companies have understood their current ESG footprint and defined targets and tolerance, they can then start integrating\nESG risk at the point of underwriting including marginal impact of new or renewed accounts. This will also include engagement\nwith insureds regarding their plans to improve ESG scores, and the support the insurer can provide on this journey.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING ESG INTO PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND UNDERWRITING WORKFLOWS: THE STATE OF THE MARKET 4The importance of understanding correlations\nFigure 3 demonstrates how important understanding correlations between metrics are to the market. Survey respondents were\nasked which correlations they wanted to understand further and could select more than one answer. We can see that three\nquarters of respondents want to understand correlations between ESG risk and claims, almost two thirds want to understand\ncorrelation between ESG risk, and premiums, and more than half want to understand ESG risk against Nat Cat model results.\nFigure 3 Appetite for understanding correlations\nThis is consistent with a broader, emerging theme around correlations with performance metrics. Insurers may find they have\nmultiple exposures around the same event, for example a Nat Cat event caused by heavy pollution may then incur litigation as\nwell as the impact of the event itself. It is important here to take a holistic view of ESG. The initial focus has often been on\nenvironmental factors and carbon reduction. Insurers should make sure that they are also considering Social and Governance\nfactors. For example, there are clear correlations between poor governance and claims. Diversity and Inclusion should also be\ncarefully considered when looking at ‘S’ scores. A low ‘S’ score can correlate to poor results as it can be an indication of how a\ncompany treats people and therefore how many claims they may receive. Transition plans are also important in creating a\nnuanced assessment and consistency with an institution’s risk appetite.\nThe opportunity to personalize the view of ESG risk\nWe can see in Figure 4 that 52% of respondents are considering whether to personalize the view of ESG risk. This could include\nblending multiple data sources or weighting data elements important to the strategy and vision. We expect this figure to increase\nas insurers get ahead of the problem, develop frameworks, assign responsibilities, and include ESG into their decision-making\nprocess.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING ESG INTO PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND UNDERWRITING WORKFLOWS: THE STATE OF THE MARKET 5Figure 4 Personalizing the view of ESG risk\nFollowing consistent market standards\nThe Commercial P&C market often exhibits an approach where there is safety in numbers. The direction of travel is likely to be\nsimilar for many participants. As Figure 5 shows, almost two thirds of the respondents indicated that they would like to be able to\nleverage a market standard ESG framework which further supports the peer consistency which is important in the Commercial\nP&C market. This confirms our observations that insurers would welcome a standard framework that helps formalize the\nassessment process, but crucially still allows them to impose their unique view of the risk. This is ‘own view’ of risk is critical for\ncompetitive purposes. We believe that the market standard should be consistent across the insurance value chain, including\nbrokers, carriers, reinsurance brokers, and reinsurers as well as retro capacity providers.\nFigure 5 Market standard ESG framework\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS INTEGRATING ESG INTO PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND UNDERWRITING WORKFLOWS: THE STATE OF THE MARKET 6Highlighting the need for accurate and reliable data\nIt is clear that to achieve the aims uncovered by the survey, insurers need accurate data that they can rely on. Good quality data\non the insured is key for insurers to achieve their aims, and ESG is no different. Insurers need to understand more about who their\ninsured are and where they are based, as well as more about other risk dimensions particularly when reputational risk is such a\npriority. Gaps in coverage need to be identified and filled as a priority.\nTaking stock of progress on the journey to integrating ESG scores\nWe can see that Commercial P&C insurers have aims of full integration of ESG scores, and most of them are making progress. To\nachieve these aims of integrating ESG into their portfolio management and underwriting workflows, insurers first need to take\nstock of exactly where they are on the journey. Then they can assess the challenges they are facing now which may become\nblockers in the future and develop a plan to overcome them. For any insurers who have not yet started, or who have severe\nbudgetary constraints, it would be prudent to look carefully at their objectives and make a realistic assessment of how they can\nstart working towards these aims.\nWe have been engaging with the market and taking a partnership approach with our commercial P&C customers to develop a\nsolution that considers ESG in the risk selection process.
