In the United States, for example, approximately 90% of the country is under some form of state-\nmandated shutdown with a few exceptions for essential businesses. With no ongoing way to generate cash flow, businesses are\nturning to lenders to immediately secure massive amounts of funding that may prove critical to their survival of this temporary\nshutdown.\nAs a result, we are seeing unprecedented drawdowns of revolving lines of credit to the point where historical experience cannot\nserve as a guide for what may happen. The industry data collected by the Federal Reserve has shown the largest-ever increase in\nthe drawdown rate for commercial lending, as shown in Figure 1:\nCommercial and industrial loans, all commercial banks, percent change, weekly, seasonally adjusted\n8.0\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\n-2.0\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nWill similar events materialize over the next few weeks in the consumer markets and other commercial segments? Although it is\nimpossible to say for sure, it would be prudent for institutions to understand what the potential impacts could be, given the\nuncertainty around the timeline of reopening the economy. In the following sections we present a common-sense methodology to\nevaluate these impacts based on two scenarios: one for average drawdowns and one for maximum drawdowns across all asset\nclasses. We performed this analysis on four different segments of institutions, including a total of 66 Institutions.\nMethodology and Assumption Overview\nOur analysis consists of taking specific line items from call report data (as of December 31, 2019) for four banking segments to\ndetermine what the capital ratio impact would be under two scenarios. The first scenario consists of an average expected level of\ncommitment drawdown while the other scenario consists of a full drawdown of all lines of credit. Since the publicly reported\namounts of unfunded exposure are not presented at the asset class level, the average drawdown scenario assumes that the\naverage percentage drawdown is applied in full to the remaining unfunded commitment—and as such may represent a more\nstressful estimate than what an individual institution’s weighted average would represent. The segments are defined as:\n» The top 25 institutions by assets\n» A sample of 10 institutions between $20 billion and $50 billion in assets\n» A sample of 10 institutions between $20 billion and $10 billion in assets\n» A sample of 21 institutions with assets of $10 billion or less\nTable 1 presents summary statistics from each sample of institutions.1\n1 The appendix gives a complete list of institutions analyzed.\n3 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILTable 1 Summary statistics for each segment\n($MM) Max Assets Size Min Assets Size Assets Std Deviation\nTop 25 2,337,646 108,739 617,396\n$50-$20 billion 50,621 23,235 10,842\n$20-$10 billion 18,067 10,056 2,911\n$10 billion or less 8,950 138 2,586\nNotes:\nFigures reflect individual observations\nAssets in millions\nSource:FDIC Call Report- https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/\nIn our analysis, we make assumptions on risk weighted asset (RWA) ratios, funding levels, and unfunded commitments already\nincluded in RWA, as well as the regulatory weight to apply to unfunded commitments. We detail our assumptions in the following\nsection.\nCalculation Overview\nData extraction was based on the FDIC database as of December 31, 2019. The fields extracted were:\n» Total Assets\n» Total RWA\n» Tier 1 Capital\n» Tier 1 Capital Ratio\n» Unused Commitment (All)\nThe flow of calculation for each bank within each segment is as follows:\n1. Compute the current ratio of assets to RWA\n2. Compute the unused commitments already included in RWA using assumptions on average credit conversion factor2 (CCF)\n3. Compute the average drawdown of unused commitment excluding the already included amount in RWA for retail and\ncommercial lines3\n4. Compute the full drawdown of unused commitment excluding the already included amount in RWA\n5. Compute the new RWA amount for both the average drawdown and full drawdown\n6. Compute new Tier 1 capital ratios for both the average drawdown and full drawdown\n7. Compute the delta between Tier 1 capital ratios at December 31, 2019 and the newly derived ratios based on the average and\nfull drawdown\n2 CCF is a Basel regulatory term used to help define which portion of an unused commitment represents the exposure that should be counted toward risk weighted\nassets (RWA).\n3 For the paper, we approximated the percentage of lines that were retail vs. commercial so that we could apply a different funding rate, as commercial lines typically\ndrawdown much faster than retail (on average).\n4 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILWe use the following equations to calculate the difference in the two scenario-based projected capital ratios from actual capital ratios:\n𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 𝒄𝒄𝑫𝑫𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 𝒓𝒓𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝒄𝒄𝒓𝒓 (𝑫𝑫𝒂𝒂𝑫𝑫𝒓𝒓𝑫𝑫𝒂𝒂𝑫𝑫 𝒅𝒅𝒓𝒓𝑫𝑫𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒓𝒓𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅)\n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 1 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐\n= 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 1 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑟𝑟 –\n𝑇𝑇𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 + (𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈 𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐 – 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈 𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑎𝑎 𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈 𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅) ∗ 𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑𝑈𝑈\n𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 𝒄𝒄𝑫𝑫𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 𝒓𝒓𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝒄𝒄𝒓𝒓 (𝒇𝒇𝒇𝒇𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 𝒅𝒅𝒓𝒓𝑫𝑫𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒓𝒓𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅)\n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 1 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐\n= 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 1 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑟𝑟 –\nA table of sample calculation𝑇𝑇s𝑟𝑟 i𝑐𝑐s𝑐𝑐 𝑐𝑐in 𝑅𝑅c𝑅𝑅lu𝑅𝑅d e+d i(n𝑈𝑈 𝑈𝑈th𝑈𝑈e𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇 a𝑈𝑈p 𝑐𝑐p𝑟𝑟e𝑐𝑐n𝑐𝑐di𝑇𝑇x𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 fo𝑇𝑇r𝑈𝑈 𝑐𝑐t h–e 𝑈𝑈 t𝑈𝑈o𝑈𝑈p𝑈𝑈 𝑇𝑇2𝑈𝑈5 𝑐𝑐b𝑟𝑟a𝑐𝑐n𝑐𝑐ks𝑇𝑇 𝑐𝑐s𝑐𝑐e𝑇𝑇g𝑈𝑈m𝑐𝑐 e𝑐𝑐n𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇t𝑇𝑇. 𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑎𝑎 𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈 𝑇𝑇𝑈𝑈 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅) ∗ 𝑓𝑓𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑈𝑈𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑𝑈𝑈\nKey Assumptions and Scenario Definitions\nDue to data limitations inherent in our primary data source, call reports, we are required to make some assumptions to complete\nthe analysis. We made these assumptions to limit their influence on the results by providing different values by asset class and\ntype, where appropriate. Further, we rely on recent data to obtain these values.\nRWA rate (ratio of total assets to RWA). We assume that the asset mix of new commitments will be consistent with the current\nasset mix at each bank. This is required to derive an appropriate RWA for the unused commitment.\nEffective CCF. We assume that the CCF applied to the unfunded commitments already included in the reported RWA are\nconsistent with the values in Table 2. This assumption is required to avoid including the unfunded commitments already\naccounted for in the reported RWA, as this information is not available. Applying this assumption allows us to use a blended CCF\nof 25% for unfunded commitments that are already on the balance sheet.\nTable 2 Effective CCF assumptions for RWA calculations\nRWA for Unfunded - Assumptions Basel IV Weights\nCCF less than 1 year 20% 25%\nCCF over 1 year 50% 25%\nCCF for letters of credit 20% 25%\nCCF unconditional commit 10% 25%\nUse blended rate of CCF 25% 100%\nSource: https://www.sullcrom.com/siteFiles/Publications/SC_Publication_Bank_Capital_Requirements_12192017.pdf.\nScenarios: Average Drawdown and Full Drawdown. For this analysis, we define two scenarios that together allow us to provide\nbookends on the impacts of increased drawdowns moving forward. In the Average Drawdown scenario, we make separate\nassumptions on the usage of consumer and commercial lines to get a better approximation of the total effect on each bank, as\nfirms differ on their exposure to consumer or commercial lending. We detail below how these assumptions were derived, as well as\nthe source of information. The Full Drawdown scenario is defined as a complete drawdown of the unused amount, less what was\nalready included in the most recent RWA observation, and so no additional assumptions are required.\nCommercial Lines. To determine typical utilization values for commercial lines, we rely on a Moody’s Analytics study of line of\ncredit usage and the exposure at default of corporate credit lines.4 In that study, the authors calculated usage rates by collateral\ntype and then further separate these values based on whether the credit eventual defaulted. This data is taken from the Moody’s\nAnalytics Data Alliance database, which gives detailed information on commercial credit, including defaulted loans.\nTable 3 shows these usage values for each segment (defined by asset type and default status), and the weights we applied to each\nvalue to get an overall usage assumption. We weighted secured and unsecured lines by 75% and 25%, respectively, and then\ndivided the weight evenly among the secured lines. The result of this weighting scheme is in the “Weight” column. A weighted\naverage usage is then calculated separately for defaulters and non-defaulters. To these values, we apply a weight of 98% to non-\ndefaulters and 2% weight to defaulters, which reflects the default rate on these credits. These calculations result in an overall\n4 Usage and exposures at default of corporate credit lines: https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2019/usage-and-exposures-at-default-of-corporate-credit-\nlines\n5 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILusage assumption of 55.9%.

We considered two sources of data to obtain estimates on consumer credit lines.5 The first source was a\nstudy on credit lines and credit utilization, while the second was data from the CreditForecast.com database, which provides a\ncomplete historical view of line utilization. We settled on the second source as it gave detailed information on utilization.\nHistorical values of utilization by asset class, as well as the weighted average usage, are depicted in Figure 2. Though forecasts for\nthese rates are available, we do not use them because comparable forecasts for commercial credit are not available.6\n5 We looked at a study from Agarwal, Ambrose, and Liu on credit lines and credit utilization that was one of the few studies that looked at retail lines of credit\nutilization. Their main finding was that a 10% drop in FICO score leads to a 15.5% increase in line utilization.\n6 CreditForecast.com provides scenario condition utilization forecasts by credit line types, which can be useful to refine the analysis further.\n6 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILRetail credit line utilization rates, percent\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nSource: CreditForecast.com and Moody’s Analytics\nWe use the weighted average utilization across products (retail, bankcard, consumer finance and home equity) during the Great\nRecession, which is the period in our historical data that is most likely to mirror where we are in the business cycle. The utilization\ndata was taken from September 2008 through September 2011, as represented in the graph. For this period, the weighted average\nusage was 31.09%.\nResults Analysis\nInstitution segment-level results\nAt the bank segment level, our analysis shows that unused commitments could significantly reduce capital ratios in the event of a\ncomplete drawdown, as defined by our Full Drawdown scenario, where borrowers decide to max out their lines of credit. Using our\nsegmentation, we observe that the top 25 institutions would undergo the most drastic reduction in capital. The other three\nsegments behave similarly in their utilization pattern and seem to be less affected by an average and full drawdown of unused\ncommitments. Those weighted average reductions would be approximately half of those observed in the top segment. We assume\nthat these large institutions have better and broader access to capital such that they could navigate the worst-case scenario\nwithout undue stress to their balance sheets. (See Figure 3 and Table 4.)\nIt is worth noting that we observed an outlier7 in the top segment, which may cause some distortion in the results. We quantified\nthe impact of this outlier as minimal, contributing to an increase of the weighted averages by 6bps and 9bps in the Average\nDrawdown and Full Drawdown scenarios, respectively. We should also point out that while we focus on the capital impact of\ndrawdowns, the liquidity impact should not be ignored; we did not test for liquidity impact as part of our analysis.\n7 Based on our analysis parameters, American Express shows very large drawdowns of unused commitment but their large portion of transactors in their portfolio\ncould be a mitigating factor. We could not make any adjustments based on the limited information on the call report.\n7 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOIL\nnoitazilitU\negatnecreP\n50-luJ 50-ceD 60-yaM 60-tcO 70-raM 70-guA 80-naJ 80-nuJ 80-voN 90-rpA 90-peS 01-beF 01-luJ 01-ceD 11-yaM 11-tcO 21-raM 21-guA 31-naJ 31-nuJ 31-voN 41-rpA 41-peS 51-beF 51-luJ 51-ceD 61-yaM 61-tcO 71-raM 71-guA 81-naJ 81-nuJ 81-voN 91-rpA 91-peS 02-beF\nBankcard: Utilization Rate Consumer Finance Revolving: Utilization Rate\nHome Equity Line: Utilization Rate Retail: Utilization Rate\nWeighted Average UsageWeighted average capital reduction potential by institution size\nCapital Consumed Average Drawdown Scenario Capital Consumed Max Drawdown Scenario\n3.50%\n3.00%\n2.50%\n2.00%\n1.50%\n1.00%\n0.50%\n0.00%\nTop 25 50-20B 20-10B 10B or less\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nTable 4 Capital impact of drawdown scenarios and maximum single institution drawdown by segment\nCapital Consumed\nAverage Drawdown Capital Consumed Max Max Institution Capital\nScenario Drawdown Scenario Consumed\nTop 25 1.69% 3.17% 8.03%\n$50-$20 billion 0.84% 1.57% 3.67%\n$20-$10 billion 0.84% 1.61% 2.24%\n$10 billion or less 0.86% 1.58% 4.85%\nNOTE: Figures reflect Dollar Weighted Averages\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nWhile the aggregate data shown in Figure 3 shows a moderated distribution of exposure down the size spectrum, the extremes\nreveal a slight dumbbell effect in the maximum observed possible exposure. This particular datapoint suggests that both the\nlargest and smallest lenders may have increased exposure, generally speaking, compared to the rest of the banking space as a\nwhole. The following section explores this observation in greater detail at the individual institution level to uncover rationalizations\nthat could be made to explain the relationship to exposure we see from the aggregated data.\nIt was noted in a review of the data at an institution level that there appeared to be an extreme focus on either commercial\nlending or consumer lending. For analytical purposes, we delineated a level of concentration in the loan portfolios to see if focus\non a particular asset class could be positively or negatively related to off balance sheet exposure. The following section describes\nthat analysis and evaluates the results.\nInstitution-specific observations\nWhile evaluating the range of potential impacts at the market level offers valuable insights into the overall exposure trends across\nthe industry, there are specific companies in our sample data set that prompt further analysis. As seen in Figure 4, there is a range\nof exposure levels in each of the size segments we defined.\n8 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILInstitution-level capital reduction potential by bank size\nMin Capital Consumed Max Capital Consumed\n9.0%\n8.0%\n7.0%\n6.0%\n5.0%\n4.0%\n3.0%\n2.0%\n1.0%\n0.0%\nTop 25 50-20B 20-10B 10B or less\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nStd Deviation\nMax Assets Min Assets Assets Std Max Capital Min Capital Capital\nSize Size Deviation Consumed Consumed Consumed\nTop 25 2,337,646 108,739 617,396 8.03% 0.02% 1.55%\n$50-$20 billion 50,621 23,235 10,842 3.67% 0.61% 0.85%\n$20-$10 billion 18,067 10,056 2,911 2.24% 1.12% 0.40%\n$10 billion or less 8,950 138 2,586 4.85% 0.44% 0.93%\nNotes:\nFigures reflect individual observations\nAssets in millions\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nAs we describe in the methodology section above, commercial and retail assumptions were segmented to align with observed\ncrisis period drawdown behavior. To further analyze if broad asset class concentrations could be an indicative factor of increased\noff-balance sheet exposure, we evaluated institutions in our sample at an individual level. Portfolios were divided between broad\ncategories of Commercial and Retail, and a “concentration” was defined as one of these segments being in excess of 70% of the\ntotal loan portfolio. Of the 66 total institutions examined, coincidentally 33 of them met the definition of having an asset class\nconcentration. The following figures identify those institutions in the size segments that had concentrations as defined by this\nanalysis.\nWhat we observe at the individual institution level is that concentrations seem to be indicative of higher exposure risk in the larger\nand community institutions, and less indicative in the regionals and sub-regionals.\nTop 25 financial institutions\nAs shown in Figure 5, the larger financial institutions typically do not have extreme asset class concentrations as defined by this\nanalysis. However, you can see that where those concentrations exist, there are wider bounds of capital exposure to off-balance\nsheet commitments. American Express obviously having a predominance in consumer lending tells one story, while BNY Mellon—\nwhich is almost entirely commercial lending—has essentially zero capital implications from unfunded commitment drawdowns.\n9 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILCapital consumption of the top 25 financial institutions by asset size\nCapital Consumed study usage Capital Consumed max usage\n8.0%\n7.0%\nNo Concentration\n6.0%\n5.0%\n4.0%\n3.0%\n2.0%\n1.0%\n0.0%\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\n$50 billion-$20 billion financial institution segment\nWhen you move down into the subregionals, the relationship between asset class concentration and off-balance sheet exposure is\nunclear. With a larger sample size in this space, you may be able to draw a relationship between those two factors; however, as a\ngroup, there are no standouts. Being regionally concentrated, perhaps these institutions manage this element of balance sheet risk\nin a way that naturally reduces their exposure to unfunded commitments.\nYou can see in Figure 6 that Bank OZK stands out here despite not having an extreme concentration using this analysis criteria. It\nis worth mentioning that the level of exposure for this particular institution is in line with the median levels across all banks, so\nwhile they may be an outlier among their peers, they are not necessarily at the extreme ends of the overall commercial banking\nspace.\nCapital consumption of the $20-$50 billion financial institution sample\nCapital Consumed study usage Capital Consumed max usage\n4.0%\n3.5%\nNo Concentration\n3.0%\n2.5%\n2.0%\n1.5%\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\nBank OZK Flagstar Umpqua TCF CIT Bank BOK Synovus Texas Investors Signature\nBank Bank Financial Capital Bank\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\n$20 billion-$10 billion financial institution segment\nContinuing down the size spectrum, there is nothing in the sample in Figure 7 that indicates a relationship between lending focus\nand unfunded commitments. Again, with a larger sample size you may be able to draw a relationship between those two factors.\nMany individual institutions fit into this size range, so expanding the population would certainly be required for confirmation.\nPerhaps this is a continuation of the regional concentration posited in the subregional space above. These lenders are even more\nconcentrated in specific geographies, so perhaps these institutions manage this element of balance sheet risk in a way that\nnaturally reduces their exposure to unfunded commitments.\n10 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILCapital consumption of the $10 billion-$20 billion financial institution sample\nCapital Consumed study usage Capital Consumed max usage\n4.00%\n3.50%\n3.00%\n2.50%\n2.00%\n1.50%\n1.00%\n0.50%\n0.00%\nStifel Bank WesBanco Cathay Bank Bank of Cadence Simmons Customers Great Popular Bank of\nand Trust Hawaii Bank, NA Bank Bank Western Bank Hope\n(Georgia)\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\n$10 billion or less financial institution segment\nCompared to the largest banks, the smaller banks in Figure 8 look like a complete inversion. While the larger banks have a few\ninstitutions with concentrations, the smallest banks have only a few without concentrations. While the concentrations in the top\n10 appear to indicate a relationship to off-balance sheet exposure, the smallest banks seem to show that the lack of a\nconcentration would indicate exposure to off-balance sheet commitments. While unclear at first, this could line up with intuition,\nwith the caveat that there seem to be few extreme examples in the selected sample.\nSmaller community lending institutions do not have the scale and resources of the largest banks. They are typically more focused\non particular asset classes with a proclivity toward certain industries. What this data could suggest is that community lenders who\nattempt to “do it all” and lend in a number of different capacities to various asset classes could be stepping outside of the credit\nlens to the point where they have lost the ability to focus on their core competencies.\nCapital consumption of the $10 billion or less financial institution sample\n6.0%\n5.0%\n4.0%\n3.0%\n2.0%\n1.0%\n0.0%\nSource: Moody’s Analytics\nTangible Evidence of Focus\nAs we observed in our initial C&I lines of credit chart, we have never seen drawdowns like these.

So the additional impact to CET1 finished draws was roughly 25 basis points for\nthe quarter.”\nBank of America’s comments underscore the relevance of our analysis.\nCitigroup\nFrom the Citigroup investor call:9 “We had roughly right around about $30 billion, $32 billion worth of draws in the first quarter,\nso somewhere 10% or 11%, 12% of our outstanding, but unfunded….Obviously something we were paying attention to. We’re in\nconstant dialogue with our clients. But again, I think you know, certainly coming into the second quarter, we’ve actually seen really\nde minimis draws on the facilities and I think in our dialogues, we don’t see or feel that pressure right now.”\nCitigroup is definitely seeing the draws, but the jump that happened in the first quarter does not seem to be continuing.\nManagement is closely monitoring the situation based on the investor call.\nWells Fargo\nFrom the Wells Fargo investor call:10 “The growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included more than $80 billion in\nborrower draw activity in the month of March on commercial banking and corporate investment banking loans. Revolving loan\nutilization and wholesale banking was 48.6% in March, up 860 basis points from December. And as I mentioned, during the first\ntwo weeks of April, we've seen these draws slow.”\nWells Fargo saw some increase in drawdowns on the commercial book, but these have slowed as of late. Another interesting note\nabout the call was that the same is not true on the retail side and with bank cards—and home equity lines balances are actually\ndeclining.\nThis market focus should be a warning to remind us that appropriate analysis of unfunded commitment is a must. Scenario\nanalysis around the levels of drawdowns, combined with mitigation strategies, would reflect sound risk management practices.\nConclusion\nUnused commitments are off-balance sheet exposures that often get little attention; like on-demand deposit, they rarely attract\nattention unless there are some excessive market movements. The COVID-19 market shock has affected everyone from retail\nmerchants no longer able to open their stores to local restaurant chains. What this analysis suggests is that as a group, certain\nlenders might be exposed to the risks presented by the coronavirus more meaningfully than others. The largest lenders that have\nconcentrated their focus instead of diversifying their portfolios might be caught unaware as drawdowns ramp up. Conversely,\ncommunity-based institutions that have branched out into new products and markets may soon regret expanding where they lack\nbench strength. We saw this same risk relationship play out in the 2007 crisis, where a few concentrated big banks got out in\nparticular asset classes, and a staggering number of community banks were throwing money at competitive CRE deals outside of\ntheir typical purview. To be clear, this comparison to 2007 is not because of the crisis or on the risk in the system, but it is\ninteresting to observe the same relational dynamic in both large and small lenders over a decade later. History may not always\nrepeat, but it does rhyme.\nThe increased discussion of unused commitments on earnings calls should serve as a reminder that in times of turmoil, these off-\nbalance sheet assets should be monitored closely. It is critical now to pay attention to all unused commitments and understand\nthe potential impact and mitigation strategies available to maintain a capital ratio above minimum threshold and limit downside\n8 Investor call transcript can be found here: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4337821-bank-of-america-corporations-bac-ceo-brian-moynihan-on-q1-2020-\nresults-earnings-call?part=single\n9 Investor call transcript can be found here: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4337832-citigroup-inc-c-mike-corbat-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-\ntranscript?part=single\n10 Investor call transcript can be found here: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4337611-wells-fargo-company-wfc-ceo-charlie-scharf-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-\ncall-transcript\n12 APRIL 2020 UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS: UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TIMES OF TURMOILsurprises.
