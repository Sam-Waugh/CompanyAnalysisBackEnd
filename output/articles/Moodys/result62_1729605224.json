All Rights Reserved8. Appendix A: Research methodology\nChartis’ RiskTech100® report is the most\ncomprehensive study of its kind, and is a core\nelement of our annual research cycle. The\nrankings in the report reflect our analysts’ expert\nopinions, along with research into market trends,\nparticipants, expenditure patterns and best\npractices. We also validate the analysis through\nseveral phases of independent verification (see\nTable 1).\nSo that we can continue to assess the market and\nits key players accurately, we are developing and\nrefining our methodology as the risk technology\nmarket evolves. Any changes will be reflected in\nsubsequent reports.\nTable 1: RiskTech100® research methodology\n• Performed a comprehensive market sweep of leading market participants in 40 risk categories.\n• Completed 1,500 surveys and interviews with risk technology buyers and end users.\n• Collected data on organizations’ expenditure priorities and vendor preferences.\n• Collated 400 completed questionnaires, briefing documents and product specifications from risk technology\nvendors.\n• Conducted and attended 200 interviews, product demonstrations and strategy briefings with risk technology\nvendors.\n• Conducted 150 interviews with risk technology buyers to validate our survey findings.\n• Conducted more than 50 interviews with independent consultants and system integrators specializing in risk\ntechnology.\n• Applied RiskTech100® assessment criteria to filter the top 150 vendors.\n• Reviewed data with 30 independent consultants and 110 risk technology buyers.\n• Interviewed 60 ex-employees of the top 50 risk technology vendors to validate our findings.\n• Undertook final data validation with 100 vendors, receiving 80 completed questionnaires and carrying out more\nthan 100 vendor briefings.\n• Completed 100+ independent reference checks to validate vendor claims and client satisfaction levels.\n• Developed the final top 100 rankings, identified the category winners and finalized the report.\nSource: Chartis Research\n33 | RiskTech100® 2023 © Copyright Infopro Digital Services Limited 2022. All Rights Reserved9. Appendix B: How to read the RiskTech100® rankings\nThe RiskTech100® assessment criteria comprise Within each category, we have included a\nsix categories: number of sub-categories to encompass the\nrange and scope of current risk technology\n• Functionality. solutions (see Table 2).\n• Core technology.\n• Strategy.\n• Customer satisfaction.\n• Market presence.\n• Innovation.\nTable 2: RiskTech100® assessment criteria\nFunctionality • Depth of functionality. The level of sophistication and detailed features in the software\nproduct. Aspects assessed include: innovative functionality, practical relevance of\nfeatures, user-friendliness, flexibility and embedded intellectual property. High scores are\ngiven to firms that achieved an appropriate balance between sophistication and user-\nfriendliness. In addition, functionality that links risk to performance is given a positive\nscore.\n• Breadth of functionality. The spectrum of risks covered as part of an enterprise risk\nmanagement solution. The risk spectrum under consideration includes treasury\nrisk management, trading risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, energy risk,\nbusiness/strategic risk, actuarial risk, asset-liability risk, financial crime and compliance.\nFunctionality within and integration between front-office (customer-facing) and middle-/\nback-office (compliance, supervisory and governance) risk management systems are also\nconsidered. High scores are given to firms achieving (or approaching) integrated risk\nmanagement – breaking the silos between different risk management functions.\nCore technology Chartis evaluates a vendor’s overall technology stack by benchmarking it against latest best\npractice. Key considerations this year have been the use of cloud and Big Data technologies,\nas well as the agility and openness of the overall technology architecture.\n• Data management. The ability of enterprise risk management systems to interact\nwith other systems and handle large volumes of data. Data quality is often cited as a\ncritical success factor, and ease of data access, data integration, data storage and data\nmovement capabilities are all important factors.\n• Risk analytics. The computational power of the core system, the ability to analyze large\namounts of data in a timely manner (e.g., real-time analytics) and the ability to improve\nanalytical performance are all important factors.\n• Reporting and visualization. The ability to surface risk information in a timely manner. The\nquality and flexibility of visualization tools, and their ease of use, are important for all risk\nand compliance management systems.\nSource: Chartis Research\n34 | RiskTech100® 2023 © Copyright Infopro Digital Services Limited 2022. All Rights ReservedTable 2: RiskTech100® assessment criteria (continued)\nStrategy • Vision and leadership. Market understanding, a scalable business model, product\nstrategy, technology strategy and go-to-market strategy are critical success factors. Both\norganic and inorganic growth strategies are considered, as well as strategic alliances and\npartnerships.\n• Ability to execute. The size and quality of the sales force, the sales distribution channels,\nthe global footprint, partnerships, differentiated messaging and positioning are all\nimportant factors. Specific consideration is given to the quality of implementation and\nsupport functions, post-sales support and training.\n• Financial performance. Revenue growth, profitability, sustainability, financial backing and\nthe percentage of recurring revenues. The ratio of license to consulting revenues is key to\nbusiness scalability.\nCustomer • Value for money. The price to functionality ratio, and the total cost of ownership versus\nsatisfaction license price.\n• After-sales service and support. Important factors include the ease of software\nimplementation, the level of support and the quality of training.\n• Product updates. Important considerations for end users include how often vendors issue\nupdates and how well they keep pace with best practice and regulatory changes.\nMarket presence • Market penetration. The number of customers in chosen markets and the rate of growth\nrelative to sector growth rate.\n• Market potential. Brand awareness, reputation, thought leadership and the vendor’s\nability to use its current market position to expand horizontally (with new offerings) or\nvertically (into new sectors).\n• Momentum. Performance in the past 12 months, including financial performance, new\nproduct releases, quantity and quality of contract wins and market expansion moves.\nInnovation • New product development. New ideas, functionality and technologies to improve risk\nmanagement for target customers. Chartis assesses new product development not in\nabsolute terms, but in relation to a vendor’s closest competitors.\n• Exploitation. Developing new products is only the first step in generating success. Speed\nto market, positioning of new products and translation to incremental revenues are\ncritical success factors.\n• New business models. Innovation is not limited to the product dimension. Some risk\ntechnology vendors are also actively working toward new business models for generating\nprofitable growth.\nSource: Chartis Research\n35 | RiskTech100® 2023 © Copyright Infopro Digital Services Limited 2022.
