Increasingly schemes have in place a de-risking\nplan, switching out of return-seeking assets as the funding level improves, targeting either buy-\nRudolf Puchy\nDirector, out or self-sufficiency.\nMoody’s Analytics\nIn this paper, we consider the cost effectiveness of longevity hedging as a risk management\noption for scheme sponsors, trustees and their advisers. We contrast the impact of implementing\nContact Us a complete hedge at the start and end of the journey plan.\nFor further information please contact our\ncustomer service team:\nLongevity risk is the risk that scheme members live longer than anticipated and therefore that\nAmericas +1.212.553.1653 pensions in payment continue for longer than expected. Rather than accepting longevity risk,\nEurope +44.20.7772.5454 trustees and sponsors can instead choose to transfer longevity risk to a third party at a cost, for\nexample by purchasing a liability hedge.\nAsia-Pacific +85.2.3551.3077\nJapan +81.3.5408.4100\nThis analysis shows that, for a scheme with any notable market risk exposure, longevity hedging\nearly in the journey /de-risking plan is likely to be of limited value. The value of longevity\nhedging increases significantly at the end of the journey plan, at the point when market risk is\nsubstantially reduced.MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nModeling the Pension Scheme\nWe use Monte-Carlo simulation to model a representative pension scheme at the beginning and the\nend of its journey plan. Monte-Carlo simulation involves simulating the position of the pension scheme\nusing many scenarios to produce statistical distributions for metrics of interest. In this case, the metric\nwe are interested in is the distribution of the surplus. A risk decomposition technique is used to separate\nthe overall risk of the scheme into the exposure due to individual risk drivers, for example longevity\nrisk. This approach allows us to analyse and compare the contributions of individual risk drivers and to\nanalyse the diversification benefits arising from the imperfect correlations between risk drivers.\nWe model longevity risk assuming two sources of uncertainty. The first represents the uncertainty\nassociated with estimating the “true” trend in mortality represented by a standard generational\nmortality table. The second represents the variation about this trend that is the extent to which actual\nmortality experienced in a given year differs from the trend.\nFigure 1 illustrates the distribution of the change in life expectancy produced by the longevity model.\nThe expected value represents the “true” trend, in mortality, the funnel captures the variation of\noutcomes stemming from the two sources of uncertainty. The solid black line represents actual\nhistorical experience. Figure 1 shows that ten years in the future, the life expectancy of a 65-year old\nmale is expected to have improved by approximately one year. In contrast, there is a one in 20 chance\nthat life expectancy has instead decreased by nine months or more.\nFigure 1 – Change in Life Expectancy for a 65 Year Old Male\n2 NOVEMBER 2014 WHEN IS LONGEVITY HEDGING A COST EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT OPTION?MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nA Representative Scheme\nIn this section, we consider a representative scheme at the start and end of its journey plan. Table 1\nsummarises the characteristics of this scheme. At the start of the journey plan, the allocation to return-\nseeking asset is relatively high at 54% as the scheme seeks to recover a shortfall of 20% on a gilts basis.\nThe matching assets are invested in a portfolio of bonds that broadly match the duration of the scheme\nliabilities.\nAt the end of the journey plan, the scheme is fully funded, with no allocation to return seeking assets.\nThe matching assets have been invested to achieve an approximate cash flow matched position. To\nsimplify our analysis, we have assumed an unchanged liability profile at the end of the journey plan.\nTable 1 - Summary scheme characteristics\nJourney plan start Journey plan end\nFunding level 80% 100%\nDeficit £16 m 0\nReturn seeking assets 54% 0%\nMatching assets 46% 100%\nDeficit contributions Level contributions commencing at the start of the journey plan that aim to\nrecover the shortfall over 10 years.\nLiabilities All liabilities of the scheme are index-linked Liabilities are valued on a gilts basis.\n3 NOVEMBER 2014 WHEN IS LONGEVITY HEDGING A COST EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT OPTION?MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nLongevity Hedging Provides Limited Value at the Start of the Journey Plan\nInitially the scheme is exposed to significant levels of market risk, for example equity risk, and longevity\nrisk is small in comparison to market risk. Longevity risk is assumed to have a low correlation with\nmarket risk so the combination of market risk and longevity risk yields a diversification benefit mostly\noffsetting the longevity risk contribution to overall risk.\nThese effects are clearly seen in Figure 2 where the contribution of longevity risk is small in comparison\nto the aggregate contribution from the market risk drivers. Figure 2 also shows that even this small\ncontribution is offset by the demographic diversification benefit. The net contribution of longevity to\noverall risk is negligible.\nThird parties will require compensation to assume longevity risk, trustees will require advice to arrange\nthe risk transfer transaction. Given that the net impact of longevity risk is small and that the cost of\ntransferring this risk is material, implementing a longevity hedge is unlikely to be cost effective in the\nearly stages of a journey plan.\nFigure 2 - Risk Decomposition at the Start of the Journey Plan\n4 NOVEMBER 2014 WHEN IS LONGEVITY HEDGING A COST EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT OPTION?MOODY’S ANALYTICS\nLongevity Hedging is a More Compelling Proposition at the End of the Journey Plan\nBy the end of the journey plan, the shortfall has been recovered, the allocation to return seeking\nassets reduced to zero and all assets invested in a suitable range of Liability Driven Investment (LDI)\ninstruments achieving an approximate cash flow matched position. The exposure to market risk has\nbeen largely eliminated, as shown in figure 3; note the change in scale from figure 2. The only remaining\nrisk exposures of the scheme, other than longevity risk, are some residual interest rate risk and inflation\nrisk due to the imperfect nature of the LDI strategy.\nLongevity risk is unchanged in absolute terms and is now the largest contributor to overall risk. The\neffective absence of market risk means that the demographic diversification benefit due to the low\ncorrelation between longevity risk and market risk is greatly reduced. The net contribution of longevity\nrisk now dominates the risk exposure of the scheme. At the end of the journey plan, a longevity hedge\nhas clearly become a cost effective risk management option.\nFigure 3 - Risk Decomposition at the End of the Journey Plan\nConclusion\nWhen a scheme’s investment strategy includes a relatively high allocation to return seeking assets, the\nnet contribution of longevity risk to overall risk is small and the cost of implementing a longevity hedge\nis likely to outweigh the benefits. As the journey plan advances, the allocation to return-seeking assets\ndiminishes. The net contribution of longevity risk to overall risk increases, as does the attractiveness of a\nlongevity hedge.\nThe net contribution of longevity risk dominates the risk profile at the end of the journey plan and\nthe cost effectiveness of a liability hedge becomes compelling. In future papers, we will consider the\nimplications of this end-state, including the impact of a staged implementation of a longevity hedge\nspread across the journey plan.\n5 NOVEMBER 2014 WHEN IS LONGEVITY HEDGING A COST EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT OPTION?MOODY’S ANALYTICS\n© 2014 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
