In August 2023, the number of new building permits granted reached a ten-year low. This downturn\ncan be attributed to declining residential property prices and stagnant growth in construction employment.\nResidential construction project cancellations in Germany rose to 22.2% in October, and new building permits\nsaw a decrease of 9.4% in November compared to the previous month. The ongoing deterioration in the sector\ncan largely be traced back to escalating project failure rates, driven by a surge in interest rates (with the\nEuropean Central Bank's interest rate peaking at 4.5% in September 2023) and soaring construction costs due\nto geopolitical and supply chain challenges. In May 2024, construction workers went on a nationwide strike, the\nfirst one in 22 years.\nGERMAN CONSTRUCTION SECTOR SHOWS HIGH CONCENTRATION OF RISKY\nCOMPANIES\nThe increase in the average probability of default for German CRE companies belies the potential credit risk of\nthe sector. When industries experience sector-wide stress, it becomes more difficult, but even more essential,\nto be able to differentiate the companies in the sector that are most at risk. Moody’s EDF-X Early Warning\nSystem (EWS) was designed to do just that. The EWS currently shows that the German construction sector\nshows a high concentration of exceptionally risk firms.\nMoody’s EDF-X EWS uses two key measures to identify companies as low, medium, high, or severe risk over the\nnext 12 months. The two measures are (1) whether a company’s forward-looking PD measure is above an\nappropriate sector early warning trigger level; and (2) the change in the PD-implied rating. Moody’s research has\nshown that public companies with high early warning signals are 25 times more likely to default over the next\nyear than firms with low early warning signals.\nThe EWS signals show that 36% of publicly traded German companies were classified as severe risk in April\n2024 compared to its peers, vs. 18% in the previous year. Figure 2 presents the April 2024 snapshot of Moody’s\nEWS, with each circle representing a company and their relative size (measured by asset value). The largest\nfirms have been relatively more resilient to the increase in credit risk, as indicated by their placement in the\nbottom left quadrant (Low Risk EWS category). This adverse situation might impact an already highly exposed\nbanking system. Not only do German banks hold the largest exposure to commercial and real estate loans in the\nEuropean Union, they are also witnessing a rise in non-performing loans.2 The planned government measures\nwill alleviate the sector contraction, but they are not expected to avoid the decline already anticipated for 2024.3\n2 Sidders, J., Confort, N. and Callanan, N.

To address this need, Moody’s’ EWS methodology has been expanded to account for alternative\nmacroeconomic scenarios to perform what-if analysis that can ultimately be used for stress testing. In the\nanalysis that follows, we examine how the EDF-X early warning signals change for German construction\ncompanies under Moody’s baseline economic scenario and a downside scenario.\nThe Moody's baseline scenario for Germany projects a marginal fall in output with an average negative year-on-\nyear growth rate of -0.37% until the last quarter of 2024, when growth is expected to turn positive.4 This\nscenario is based on the assumptions of no escalations in global geopolitical tensions and no changes in\nmonetary and fiscal policies until mid-2024, when the ECB is expected to start cutting rates. Under this\nscenario, there is a significant improvement in the risk of public German companies in the CRE sector. Figure 3\nshows the scenario-conditioned early warning signals distribution for these companies in December 2024.\nCompared to April 2024, the percentage of companies classified as severe risk has decreased significantly from\n36% to 20%, while the percentage of companies classified as low risk has increased from 45% to 64%.\nIn a downside scenario, the credit risk environment for construction and real estate companies deteriorates\nsignificantly. In this Moody’s scenario, sentiment in Europe turns down sharply amidst increasing concerns\naround global growth. Geopolitical tensions rise due to fears of escalations in the war in Ukraine and the Israel-\nHamas conflict, as well as an increase in tensions between China and the U.S. The resulting increase in risk\naversion leads to a sell-off in global financial markets, setting the scene for a moderate but prolonged recession\nwhere the ECB hesitates to cut rates. In this scenario, by December 2024 most public firms in the CRE sector\nare classified either as medium or severe risk, with firms under severe risk constituting 36% of the sector.\n4 Moody’s alternative economic scenarios are available through www.economy.com to subscribers of the service.\nFroom Boom to Gloom: Navigating the Impending Downturn in the German Construction and Real Estate Sector 3Credit Strategy\nFIGURE 3 Scenario conditioned early warning signals distribution for public German companies in the CRE\nsector, December 2024\nData source: Moody’s EDF-X platform.\nA “VICTIM” OF THE SECTOR DOWNTURN: TRAUMHAUS AG\nA clear example of how the sector downturn is affecting specific companies is Traumhaus AG, a public German\ncompany with total assets around $160 mil (as of date Orbis, 2022). Founded in 1993, the company operates\nwithin the full chain of real estate project development, from land acquisition to production, marketing, and\nmanagement of properties. The company recently filed for self-administration proceedings. The financial\ndownturn and situation surrounding the company have been extensively covered in the news media.\nMoody’s EWS flagged Traumhaus AG as being under severe risk in June 2023, when the company’s 1-year PD\njumped to 3.1% (equivalent to a B1 implied rating), surpassing the early warning trigger level as shown in Figure\n4. This severe risk warning was issued four months before the first of several steep declines in the company’s\nstock price that would occur in 2023. The initial severe decline took place in October 2023, with the stock value\nfalling by 38% over a week. A subsequent decline occurred in a single day in November, with the stock plunging\nfrom €2.20 to €0.28. This was also preceded by the EWS’s one-year PD escalating to 18.7%. The PD eventually\nreached its peak at 50%, when the company entered administration.5\n5 50% is the maximum forward-looking probability of default for non-financial companies in Moody’s EDF-X platform.\nFroom Boom to Gloom: Navigating the Impending Downturn in the German Construction and Real Estate Sector 4Credit Strategy\nFIGURE 4 Traumhaus AG’s one-year PD vs. its sector early warning trigger level\nData source: Moody’s EDF-X platform.\nThe protracted path of Traumhaus AG into administration was traced by EWS, as shown in Figure 5. The\ncompany's low and stable early warning signal began to deteriorate in early 2022, and by June of the same year,\nthe company was marked as medium risk. The firm’s credit risk continued to deteriorate, gradually approaching\nsevere risk by June 2023, six months prior to administration.\nFIGURE 5 Traumhaus AG’s early warning signal across time\nData source: Moody’s EDF-X platform.\nFroom Boom to Gloom: Navigating the Impending Downturn in the German Construction and Real Estate Sector 5Credit Strategy\nNAVIGATING DISTRESS WITH TIMELY RISK IDENTIFICATION\nThe credit risk deterioration within the German construction sector, as indicated by Moody's forward-looking\nprobability of default, suggests that the industry is potentially on the verge of a significant downturn. This\ndownturn, characterized by an uptick in project cancellations and a growing number of companies deemed\nsevere in terms of credit risk, signals a potential crisis in the making. In a scenario where the German economy\nunderperforms beyond expectations, the sector could face a more prolonged and severe crisis, with an\nincreasing number of companies struggling to maintain their operations. Moody’s scenario conditioned EWS\nestimates that the percentage of at-risk companies could rise to 40% under an adverse economic scenario.\nA striking example of this crisis is the case of Traumhaus AG. Moody’s Early Warning System (EWS) helped in\nidentifying and anticipating significant increases in credit risks within specific country and sector markets.\nIdentifying risky firms on time is crucial for credit risk management as it provides investors and lenders with\ngreater opportunities to implement mitigation plans and reduce financial impacts.\nFroom Boom to Gloom: Navigating the Impending Downturn in the German Construction and Real Estate Sector 6Credit Strategy\nCONTACT US\nAMERICAS EMEA\n+1.212.123.4567 +44.20.1234.5678\nclientservices@moodys.com clientservices.emea@moodys.com\nASIA (Excluding Japan) JAPAN\n+852.1234.5678 +81.1234.5678\nclientservices.asia@moodys.com clientservices.japan@moodys.com\nFroom Boom to Gloom: Navigating the Impending Downturn in the German Construction and Real Estate Sector 7Credit Strategy\n© 2024 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
