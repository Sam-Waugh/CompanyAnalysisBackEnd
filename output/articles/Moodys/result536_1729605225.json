IFRS 17 AND SOLVENCY II. THIS IS ALL THE\nMORE SURPRISING GIVEN THE LACK OF\nThe survey took into account the views of 36 senior individuals from SPECIFIC REGULATION AROUND ESG\nP&C commercial (re)insurers, with gross written premium (GWP) DISCLOSURES.\nranging from $100 million to over $5billion, from around the world.\nAll respondents were senior members in portfolio management and\nunderwriting teams. The survey took place amid challenging market conditions. (Re)insurers are contending with macroeconomic\nfactors, such as inflation rising to levels not seen in recent times, increasing interest rates and the war in Ukraine. These\nconsiderations, alongside other industry trends such as the evolution of automated underwriting processes have created pressures for\n(re)insurers across the world.\nIn this report, we present the key results from the survey and offer insights from some of the main findings, including:\n» Firms are continuing to prioritize ESG underwriting as a new capability to be incorporated into their portfolio monitoring process.\nThere has been a 96% increase in the number of (re)insurers wishing to integrate ESG within the next six months, with the number\nof firms wanting to incorporate ESG right away doubling (from 14% to 29%).\n» Bridging the gap between underwriting and sustainability teams presents unique challenges to operationalizing ESG underwriting.\nMore than half of respondents (57%) identify their lack of sustainability expertise as a block to integrating ESG risk factors into\nunderwriting workflows. Firms are also looking for partners that can offer more than just ESG data (71%). They want solutions that\nare tailored to the specific needs of their underwriting teams.\n» The number one driver for ESG underwriting was risk management, suggesting that the market views ESG underwriting as a core\nrisk management capability (91%). In addition, nearly half of respondents (40%) identify ESG underwriting as a potential\ncompetitive advantage that can help them create revenue opportunities with customers.\n3\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGCommitment to integrating ESG risk factors into underwriting\nWe can see that there has been a significant increase in (re)insurers finalizing their commitment to introduce ESG into the\nunderwriting process, with a rise of 120% in those who have defined their commitment year over year from the 2022 survey, shown\nin figure 1.\nThe increase shows that commitment to incorporate ESG into the underwriting process is gathering pace at a rate reminiscent of\nnew regulation such as Solvency II or IFRS 17. This is impressive considering that there are not yet specific regulations around ESG.\nFigure 1 What stage is a company like yours at with defining your commitment to integrating ESG factors in the underwriting\nprocesses?\n4\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGDrivers for integrating ESG risk factors into underwriting\nWhen attempting to understand what is prompting the increase in (re)insurers finalizing their commitment to introduce ESG to the\nunderwriting process, it is interesting to see that over 90% of respondents cite ‘risk management’ as a key driver. Suggesting that\nESG risk is now a core risk management consideration for (re)insurers. The significant rise in ‘regulation’ as a driver, with over half of\nrespondents viewing it as key, suggests that (re)insurers expect that regulation will become more stringent over time. There is also a\nrise in the number of respondents who believe that integrating ESG into the underwriting process can give them a competitive edge\nand create revenue opportunities, with 40% now stating this view.\nThe increase in (re)insurers who believe integrating ESG into underwriting can provide a competitive edge reinforces the view that\nESG is an opportunity for the (re)insurance market rather than a constraint.\nOpportunities for (re)insurers could include developing new products, insuring new sectors, differentiation in a crowded market, and\nattracting alternative capital.\nFigure 2 What are the drivers for integrating ESG risk factors in underwriting for companies like yours?\n5\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGThe practicalities of the journey to incorporate ESG into underwriting\n(Re)insurers were asked how their company would score on implementing ESG scoring, figure 3. Responses show an 85% increase in\noperationalization, year over year. The increase appears to support the view that the insurance industry is taking practical steps to\nincorporate ESG into underwriting.\nFigure 3 Where would a company like yours be in the implementation of ESG scoring for insurance business?\n6\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGIncreasing budgets and shortening timeframes\nThere is a 96% increase in (re)insurers who wish to integrate ESG within underwriting the next six months, and the number of\n(re)insurers looking to do so straight away doubling, figure 4. More than half of respondents want to implement ESG in underwriting\nwithin the next 12 months.\nFigure 4 What’s typically the urgency for integrating ESG for businesses like yours?\nReflecting the sense of urgency, the study shows that 60% of (re)insurers\nhave increased budgets in the last two years, figure 5. This includes 20%\nof respondents who increased budgets by more than 30%.\nTHE INCREASING COMMITMENT TO\nESG INTEGRATION IS REFLECTED IN\nThe findings indicate that (re)insurers recognize the importance of\nINCREASING BUDGETS\npractical insights on their ESG journeys, which necessitates the\ninvestment in ESG expertise, data, and analytical tools. Budgets are likely\nto maintain an upwards trend as ESG continues to gain importance.\n7\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGFigure 5 Over the last two years, how has the budget for a company like yours changed for ESG data and products changed?\n8\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGChallenges to integrating ESG into the underwriting process\nIn the 2023 survey we introduced a new question to understand blockers to integrating ESG’. into the underwriting process. There is\nclearly appetite to understand what might be inhibiting progress in order to take steps to make improvements. 60% of survey\nrespondents cited a lack of ESG data for private companies as a blocker, figure 6. This is understandable when we consider the\nexposure many (re)insurers have to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs and private entities often comprise a significant\nproportion of a (re)insurer’s portfolio. The second highest reason given, with almost 60%, is a lack of internal expertise. We are\nincreasingly seeing (re)insurers hiring sustainability professionals to address this need. The next highest response raised concerns\naround the complexity of integrating internal data that may not be of high enough quality.\nOne third of (re)insurers cite internal resistance, which may be coming from underwriters who are concerned that integrating ESG\ncould lead to a trade-off against growth or profitability. However, this finding is especially interesting when we also consider that\n40% of responders, shown in figure 2, suggest that integrating ESG into the underwriting process could provide a competitive edge.\nFigure 6 What are the blockers to integrating ESG risk factors in underwriting for companies like yours?\n70%\n60%\n60% 57%\n50%\n43%\n40%\n31% 31%\n30%\n20%\n20%\n11%\n10%\n0%\n0%\nLack of ESG data Lack of Quality and/or Internal External political Lack of budget Solutions in the Other\nfor private expertise fidelity of resistance climate market do not\ncompanies internal data meet our needs\nmakes it\ncomplex to\nintegrate ESG\n2023\n9\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGAppetite for a market standard\nNearly three-quarters, 72% of (re)insurers report that they would like a market standard clarifying the definition of ESG risk, figure 7.\nThere are currently different views on what is covered by the ‘E’, ‘S’ and ‘G’ that comprise ESG. A common definition of ESG risk\nwould give (re)insurers access to a consistent set of data points when analyzing companies. Such a standard could help streamline\nthe conversation across the entire value chain. It would also help all market participants, including brokers, carriers and (re)insurers,\ntake a consistent approach to ESG.\nFigure 7 Do you want a market standard?\n28%\n72%\nYes No\n10\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGAppetite for customization of ESG scores\nWhen asked if they would like the ability to customize ESG scores, 66% of (re)insurers said yes they would like the ability to\ncustomize ESG scores, figure 8. A 25% year over year increase from our 2022 survey . (Re)insurers will look to clarify their own views\non ESG and then calibrate their ESG weighting based on those views. The ability to customize ESG scores enable (re)insurers to take\nownership of their ESG processes and provide the additional benefit of aligning their view of ESG risk with their sustainability\nstrategy.\nFigure 8 Would you like the ability to customize ESG scores?\n34%\n66%\nYes No\n11\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGAppetite for a vendor software application\n71% of (re)insurers wanted or were interested in a vendor software application, not just data, figure 9. A 16% increase from our 2022\nsurvey responses to this question. For nearly three-quarters of respondents, data alone is not sufficient to provide insight. Analytical\ntools can help firms operationalize ESG risk by converting data to insights. Helping to give portfolio managers a deeper understanding\nof their portfolio exposures, and enable underwriters to form their own perspectives on risk and also understand the marginal impact\nof new accounts and renewals at the point of underwriting.\nFigure 9 Would someone in your position consider a vendor software application for helping to integrate ESG?\n29%\n71%\nYes No\n12\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGA requirement for ESG data\n91% of (re)insurers reported that they now would be open to ask insureds for ESG-related information, figure 10. An increase of 9%\nyear over year, further supporting the view that (re)insurers are taking steps to integrate ESG into their underwriting process.\nFigure 10 Would underwriters in an organization like yours be open to asking their insured for data that would help inform ESG scores?\n9%\n91%\nYes No\n13\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITINGTaking stock of progress on the journey to integrating ESG scores\nThe Moody’s Analytics and Moody’s RMS ESG in P&C Underwriting 2023 survey clearly shows that appetite for incorporating ESG\ninto underwriting has increased over the last year. Although still at an early stage (re)insurers are now working to understand the\nsustainability impact on their business, and treaty books that will provide a transparent benchmarking approach across counterparties\nand the diverse risk classes.\nThe results of the 2023 survey results support the finding that the appetite for incorporating ESG into underwriting has increased wit\nthe following results:\n» 120% increase in (re)insurers defining their ESG commitments\n» 96% increase in (re)insurers wanting to integrate ESG in the next six months or sooner\n» 85% increase in (re)insurers taking action to operationalize ESG\n» 60% increase in (re)insurers seeing rising ESG budgets over the last two years.\nHowever, challenges do still remain, with 71% of respondents saying they need more than just ESG data for underwriting, 60%\nreporting that the lack of ESG data for private companies is a blocker and 57% citing the lack of internal expertise.\nTo continue progress on their path to integrate ESG into underwriting, (re)insurers need to take stock of exactly where they are on\nthe journey, capitalize on the positive steps they have taken so far, and develop a plan to overcome the challenges they are still\nfacing.\n14\nMOODY’S / STATE OF THE MARKET 2023: INCORPORATING ESG INTO P&C UNDERWRITING© 2023 Moody’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Moody’s Analytics, Inc. and/or their licensors and affiliates (collectively, “MOODY’S”).
