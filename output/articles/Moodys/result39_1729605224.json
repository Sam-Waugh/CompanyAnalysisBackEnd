    "content": "DEVELOPING A\nHIGH-PERFORMING\nSALES CULTURE\nBEST PRACTICES FOR BANK LEADERSHIP\nWHITE PAPERHaven’t all banks adopted cross-selling as a business imperative?\nOf course. You’d be hard-pressed to find a bank that hasn’t targeted cross-selling as\npivotal to its success. It’s well established that acquiring new customers costs much\nmore than retaining and deepening relationships with existing ones, and that the\nmore products and services customers use, the less likely they are to leave. Banks\nhave capitalized on this information by requiring employees to cross-sell during their\ninteractions with customers and prospects.\nIn fact, banks often tout their product per customer ratios as evidence of their\ncross-sellling success. Many have exceeded the six products per household range.\nWith that kind of success, why re-examine cross-selling, especially when there are\nother exciting initiatives to pursue – like enhancing the mobile experience, exploring\nblockchain technology, or employing predictive analytics?\nBecause it’s unclear whether bankers are selling effectively – specifically, whether\nthey’re selling products that are both valuable to the customer and profitable for\nthe bank.\n“In our experience, bankers often focus on the metrics – they’re goal-oriented and\nwant to succeed. But ultimately, in order for the bank to succeed, the customer has\nto succeed, and that means the banker has to understand the customer’s needs and\nidentify solutions the customer will truly value. The more the customer values the\nsolution, the greater willingness they’ll have to deepen the relationship,” says Andrea\nBinkley, senior learning partner at Moody’s Analytics.\nThe potential for happier customers and a healthier bottom line make it critical to\ncontinually re-evaluate your commitment to cross-selling.\nSome important questions to ask:\n• Do your cross-sell ratios reflect true relationship building?\n• Do your customers feel they’re getting a sales pitch . . . or do\nthey feel their best interests are being considered?\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 1Shifting the focus to relationship building\nCustomer-facing\nCustomer-facing employees should continually ask themselves, “Have I done\nemployees should\neverything I can to contribute to this customer’s financial success?”\ncontinually ask\nthemselves, “Have\nOf course, you cannot answer that question unless you’re familiar with the customer’s\nI done everything situation and needs – and you can only obtain that information from a meaningful\nI can to contribute conversation with the customer.\nto this customer’s\nSuppose that future loyalty resides not at the product level but at the relationship\nfinancial success?”\nlevel. Ignore the cross-sell numbers for a moment and look at your customer retention,\ncustomer satisfaction, and profitability data.\n• Have there been any customer complaints about sales tactics?\n• Are customers closing accounts shortly after opening them?\n• Are bankers selling only the “product of the month”?\n• How has selling impacted employee retention? Does the stress of selling result\nin burnout?\n• Does everyone know who the bank’s best customers are?\nWhat do you see when you look beyond the ratios? Bank leaders must be confident\nthat the organization’s sales activities are based on integrity, credibility, understanding,\nand needs identification – the key elements that foster true relationship building.\nAs you assess your organization’s cross-selling efforts, you can benefit from the following\nbest practices.\nFIVE BEST PRACTICES\n1\nCommunicate the importance of sales.\n2\nIncorporate sales into job descriptions.\n3\nTrain managers to have effective sales conversations.\n4\nDevelop the staff’s conversational skills.\n5\nChange behavior through formal coaching and accountability.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 21\nCOMMUNICATE\nTHE IMPORTANCE\nOF SALES\nIt’s critical that senior managers deliver the sales message and explain how\nselling impacts the bank, the customer, and the employee.\nBankers often think sales goals exist in a vacuum. “Sell X number of checking\naccounts, generate X number of loan referrals, and schedule X number\nof appointments with financial advisors” may be the only message that\nregisters. Bankers may have little understanding of the benefits that those\naccounts, referrals, and appointments can provide to customers. They may\nnot understand how deepening the relationship can improve customer\nsatisfaction, loyalty, and overall profitability.\nBankers must understand that their role is to help customers by identifying\nBankers must needs and finding solutions. They should receive regular communications\nunderstand that from senior management about how meaningful sales are to the overall\ntheir role is to growth and stability of the bank.\nhelp customers by\nidentifying needs\nTAKE ACTION\nand finding solutions.\n• Communicate with bankers in person or virtually to introduce\nsales goals.\nEmployees feel empowered when they are included in meetings with senior\nmanagement. Your staff needs to know that the sales message – and the support\nfor it – originates at the top.\n• Include the rationale for sales goals and objectives.\nBankers sometimes think they are being asked to sell products and services that\ncustomers don’t really want or need. Many households, however, have dozens of\nfinancial products, including mortgages, auto loans, checking and savings accounts,\ncredit cards, and investment and retirement accounts. It’s not that customers don’t\nwant or need these products, it’s just that they’re often spread across a variety\nof financial entities. If you enlist employees in an effort to consolidate customers’\nfinancial services at one bank, you will provide employees with a goal they\ncan adopt.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 3TAKE ACTION\n(continued)\n• Explain which products are most profitable and why.\nInvestment and insurance products can greatly increase a customer’s allegiance\nto your bank, and investment customers typically have much higher balances than\naverage bank customers. When your employees realize this, it will encourage them\nto make referrals to your bank’s financial advisors.\n• Assure employees that they will be equipped to achieve\nsales objectives.\nBankers want assurance that they will have the technology, training, and coaching\nto do what is being asked of them. Reassure them that selling is a team effort,\nbolstered by concrete plans that will ensure their sales development.\n• Provide insight into employee incentive plans.\nWhile the banker’s immediate manager can handle compensation details, meetings\nwith senior management should include a broad message about how the banker\nwill benefit from building relationships. Focus on rewarding not just short-term\nproduct numbers, but long-term customer relationships and their correlating lifetime\nvalue. Compensation plans should reflect the benefits that sales bring to all three\nparticipants – customer, employee, and bank.\n• Provide frequent, consistent feedback on achievements\nand challenges.\nThe banker’s immediate manager is not the only one who should be discussing\nsales successes and challenges with them. Ongoing conversations with senior\nmanagement should include regular discussion of what’s going well and where\nimprovement is required throughout the enterprise.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 42\nINCORPORATE\nSALES INTO JOB\nDESCRIPTIONS\nConsider the universal banker position. As it becomes the norm in financial\ncenters, new-hire interviews will focus as much on sales skills as functional\nand operational skills. Even if your bank is not moving in that direction, your\nfocus on sales has to be conveyed to new hires in all positions.\nNote the following (adapted from an actual job description), which could\neasily serve as a guideline for every customer-facing role, from banker and\nbranch manager to relationship manager and credit officer.\nTAKE ACTION\nIncorporate the following requirements (or their equivalent) in job\ndescriptions for all customer-facing positions. Leave no doubt that\nemployees are expected to perform these activities on a daily basis.\n• Ask questions to analyze needs and identify solutions for customers.\n• Make sales referrals to specialized areas of the bank, based on customer needs.\n• Proactively seek out current and potential customers for sales and customer\nservice opportunities through calling activities and the use of marketing resources.\n• Work with banking office team members to achieve individual and branch sales\ngoals by opening new accounts, taking loan applications, and/or closing loans.\nNo one should be exempt from these requirements, so including them in job\ndescriptions and performance reviews should be a best practice at every\nfinancial organization.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 53\nTRAIN MANAGERS\nIN EFFECTIVE SALES\nCONVERSATIONS\nManagers must be personally committed to sales. The best way to convey\ntheir commitment is through modeling and performance. Managers\nmust exhibit the same questioning skills, needs identification expertise,\nand product knowledge they want to see in their staff. When managers\ndemonstrate customer engagement skills, their employees emulate these\nbehaviors – and by practicing these skills over time, they evolve into\nWhen managers\nrelationship builders who drive your brand.\ndemonstrate customer\nengagement skills,\ntheir employees\nTAKE ACTION\nemulate these\nbehaviors.\n• Provide managers with the same training opportunities that their\ndirect reports will receive.\nManagers know the technical aspect of their jobs, but they are frequently expected\nto coach their employees in sales without any actual knowledge of selling.\nAggressive goals make it imperative for everyone to contribute, so it is important for\nemployees to observe their managers in action, modeling the skills that employees\nare expected to develop.\nDirect reports are often apprehensive about the level of engagement required in\ntraining. Knowing their managers are also required to complete practices, simulations,\nand activities will reduce employees’ anxiety and promote buy-in.\n• Hold managers accountable for following your organization’s\nsales model.\nFinancial organizations are looking for a return on their training investments.\nDeveloping sales talent requires managers to step up and apply new skills,\nregardless of past approaches. Bankers will be watching to see whether what they\nhear is consistent with what they see. They will be motivated only if they see their\nmanagers applying the same sales methods they’re asked to use, particularly with\nregard to questioning and needs identification.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 6TAKE ACTION\n(continued)\n• Ask managers to practice sales conversations with\ndirect reports.\nQuestioning skills must be practiced and refined; otherwise, conversations can become\ninterrogations. In team meetings and impromptu gatherings, managers should give\nemployees opportunities to practice these skills in a non-threatening environment.\nRecord practices and use them to educate others on exemplary approaches.\n• Refresh learning with job aids and templates.\nPlanning for outside calls and appointments is the best way to position yourself to\ngain a clear understanding of customer needs. Require bankers to use questioning\nguides, pre-call templates, and other materials that will keep them focused during\ntheir conversations.\nManagers must fully commit to developing their own skills to set an example\nfor their teams. Simply observing training sessions, rather than participating\nManagers must in them, is insufficient.

Bankers\ncannot be expected to rally around selling if they can’t make the connection\nbetween what your bank offers and what customers need – and that\nconnection can only be made by having an effective conversation with\nthe customer.\nTAKE ACTION\n• Make your employees “students of your business.”\nOrganizations need to reiterate that effective customer interactions help them prosper\nand expand. The perfect opportunity to deliver this message is at the “kickoff” for\ntraining. This is the ideal venue for senior managers to express their commitment to\ndeveloping a sales culture – and to explain how each department and individual will\ncontribute to its success.\n• Provide a conversation model that instills confidence.\nCustomer conversations should not be scripted, but they should follow a logical path.\nConfidence is crucial in business interactions, and having a model to follow empowers\nConfidence is crucial customer-facing staff. Sales models often feature graphics and acronyms that guide\nin business interactions, the user through all components of a successful conversation. Such models specifically\nand having a model allow for logical transitions and ample questioning – ensuring that the customer does\nto follow empowers most of the talking.\ncustomer-facing staff.\n• Deliver training in a variety of ways.\nNot all individuals learn in the same way; a variety of methodologies is required to\nensure retention. Online training affords self-paced learning, while in-person sessions\nallow learners to apply what they have learned, giving them ample opportunities\nfor practice and peer collaboration. Immersing bankers in scenarios that replicate\ncustomer interactions provides a safe practice environment: the best way to ensure\ntransfer to the workplace.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 8TAKE ACTION\n(continued)\n• Encourage the use of job aids.\nIt is ideal to have a series of open-ended questions at hand to stimulate\nconversations. Over time, staff will learn to prep for calls and appointments by\nasking the questions that yield the most beneficial information. Practicing with a\njob aid will help staff to verbalize effective questions so that they sound natural and\nunrehearsed.\nIn selling, reluctance is best overcome with confidence – and nothing builds\nconfidence better than training and practice. For most bankers, knowing how\nto sell is knowing where to start: many find beginning the conversation more\ndifficult than closing the sale. The key is knowing which questions to ask.\nTraining enables bankers to see themselves as good conversationalists with\nexcellent listening skills. From then on, it’s all reinforcement and practice.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 95\nCHANGE BEHAVIOR\nTHROUGH FORMAL\nCOACHING AND\nACCOUNTABILITY\nCoaching has been a part of athletics for millenia, which is why most\ncoaching references are sports-related. Businesses began to use coaching\nas a management tool in the 1940s, primarily in the form of developmental\ncounseling for struggling managers. Coaching to specific skills became\npopular in the 1980s and 1990s, as talent development came to represent a\nlarger part of the budget for employers committed to best practices. More\nrecently, coaching emerged as a means of guaranteeing a return on the\ntraining investment.\nWith its decades of expertise in financial services training, Moody’s Analytics\nis often asked how we make training “stick.” This is an important question,\nconsidering the organization’s investment of time and money – but when we\nThe most\nsay coaching is the answer, we’re often met with resistance.\ncomprehensive\ntraining will not\nWhy? Some people think it takes too much time. Others think it’s a soft skill,\nfully transfer to the\nunlikely to achieve business results. And some don’t take it seriously because\nworkplace if it is\ntheir past coaching efforts haven’t been successful. The truth, though, is that\nnot reinforced.\nlearners will not transfer even the most innovative, comprehensive, and spot-on\ntraining to the workplace if it is not reinforced. In our experience, clients that\nadopt coaching as a part of training, not an add-on, achieve the best results.\nTAKE ACTION\n• Create a coaching culture.\nCoaching should be scheduled, consistent, specific, and developmental.\nEmployees should look forward to having their manager’s undivided attention in a\nconversation about what they’ve done well and what they can do to improve.\nInsist that everyone in the organization – even the executive officers who receive\ntheir coaching from outside sources – be coached.\n• Train managers to coach.\nCoaching is a skill that must be learned and practiced; it is not inherent in\neveryone promoted to a managerial role. In order to effectively model customer\nconversations, managers should complete the same sales training as their direct\nreports. They can then observe their employees in action, assess their skills, and\ndiscuss successes and areas for development.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 10TAKE ACTION\n(continued)\n• Employ a definitive coaching model.\nLike sales conversations, coaching conversations should not be scripted. They\nshould, however, follow a consistent process that fosters a positive exchange\nbetween the coach and the direct report.\n• Typically, the conversation begins with a brief review of the coaching\nsession agenda.\n• The banker then self-identifies their successes, whether quantitative or\nqualitative. The coach should be able to supplement these comments with\nspecific observations of their own.\n• The coach can then transition to areas of development. Once again, the banker’s\nself-assessment should be followed by the coach’s observations.\n• Establish an action plan.\nThis is the most important of the coaching best practices. Without an action plan,\nWithout an action coaching is just a friendly chat, not a catalyst for change.\nplan, coaching is just\nOnce the manager and banker agree on successes and areas of development,\na friendly chat, not a\nthey need to make a concrete plan for sustainment and growth. The “what” has\ncatalyst for change. been identified. Now, both parties must focus on the “how” – being specific about\nthe steps to be taken, the time frame, and the help and support to be provided. A\nfollow-up is then scheduled to review progress.\n• Coach the coach.\nTraining shouldn’t stop once a manager learns to coach. Coaching expertise\ndevelops with practice. Using a model and following a process can become easier\nwith each coaching session, but how can an organization be sure that progress\nis indeed occurring? Someone needs to coach the coach. Managers, or coaching\ntrainers, can observe coaching sessions (in person or by phone) and then apply the\nsame method: self-assessment of successes and areas for development, followed by\ndevelopment of an action plan.\n• Schedule coaching sessions.\nExperience has shown that unless coaching is scheduled, it doesn’t occur. Even\nif it’s on the calendar, it’s possible that something will pre-empt it. However, as\nbankers begin to depend on feedback, they themselves will be eager to reschedule.\nManagers will also want to be perceived as true to their word, so the schedule has\nsignificant weight in ensuring that coaching takes place.\nIt’s critical that organizations give coaching a chance. It’s also okay to ease\ninto it. The important thing is to begin the process and commit to sustaining\nit. Based on our clients’ experiences, managers who coach their bankers\nregularly see growth in the bottom line as well.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 11CONCLUSION\nEffective customer conversations are the key to cross-selling success. To that\nend, we have evolved our training approaches to ensure that bankers learn\nand apply essential skills that will differentiate their organization from its\ncompetitors. Beyond that, we have suggested the cultural changes that will\nsupport training and provide the greatest opportunity for long-term success.\nThe five best practices for effective cross-selling fall into two categories:\ninternal conversations and external conversations (with customers and\nprospects). If a bank is to succeed in its cross-selling initiatives, it must be\nsuccessful at both. Even if your bank has a long-standing strategy in this\narena, you should periodically review its effectiveness. Then, you can explore\nhow your internal and external conversations are impacting your results.\nDeveloping a High-Performing Sales Culture | 12THE MOODY'S ANALYTICS DIFFERENCE\nMoody's Analytics is a trusted credit and sales training partner, offering\nhigh-impact training solutions to banks, credit unions, wealth management\nfirms, and non-bank financial institutions worldwide.
