Introduction\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the final securitization framework under Basel III in July\n2016. This framework comes into effect in January 2018. The framework includes the revised securitization\nframework published in December 2014, along with the alternative capital treatment for simple, transparent,\nand comparable (STC) securitizations. Basel definitions for Simplicity, Transparency, and Comparability are\npresented in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Definitions of simplicity, transparency, and comparability\nTerm Definition\nSimplicity refers to the homogeneity of underlying assets with simple characteristics\nSimplicity\nand a transaction structure that is not overly complex.\nCriteria for transparency provide investors with sufficient information on the\nunderlying assets, the structure of the transaction, and the parties involved in the\nTransparency transaction, promoting a more comprehensive and thorough understanding of the\nrisks involved. The manner in which the information is available might not hinder\ntransparency, but instead supports investors in their assessment.\nCriteria promoting comparability could assist investors in their understanding of\nsuch investments and enable more straightforward comparison across securitization\nComparability\nproducts within an asset class. Importantly, they might appropriately account for\ndifferences across jurisdictions.\nThe revisions to the securitization framework were the result of the global financial crisis of 2007–08, which\nhighlighted weaknesses in the existing Basel framework. The revised framework simplifies hierarchy in terms\nof the number of approaches, reduces mechanistic reliance on external ratings, and enhances risk-sensitivity,\nas detailed in Figure 2. The application of the hierarchy no longer depends on the role that the bank plays in\nthe securitization (investor or originator), or on the credit risk approach that the bank applies to the type of\nunderlying exposures. Instead, the revised hierarchy of approaches relies on the information available to the\nbank and on the type of analysis and estimations that it can perform on a specific transaction.\nFigure 2. Key enhancements to revised securitization framework\nWeakness How the weakness has been addressed\n» Basel II framework had multiple approaches, with four ratings-based approaches\nlook-up tables (2 under internal ratings-based and 2 under standardized approach),\ntwo internal approaches for non-rated exposures, and several exceptional\ntreatments.\nComplexity » However, the simplified revised hierarchy consists of only three approaches:\ninternal ratings-based, external ratings-based, and standardized approaches.\n» The application of hierarchy no longer depends on a bank’s role in securitization or\non its credit risk approach, but on information availability and on the analysis and\nestimations that a bank can perform.\n3 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nWeakness How the weakness has been addressed\n» Basel II requires banks to use the external ratings-based approach, unless external\nor inferred ratings are not available.\n» Under Basel III, the external ratings-based approach is no longer at the top of the\nMechanistic reliance\nhierarchy and national jurisdictions have the discretion to allow or disallow its use.\non external ratings\n» Extra risk drivers (maturity and tranche thickness for non-senior approaches) have\nbeen incorporated into the external ratings-based approach to reduce reliance on\nexternal ratings and improve risk-sensitivity.\n» The revised framework results in higher capital requirements, commensurate with\nthe risk of securitization exposures. However, low-risk securitizations that meet the\nSTC criteria do get a more favorable capital treatment.\nInadequate risk- » The final standard incorporates increased risk weights for highly rated securitization\nsensitivity exposures and reduced risk weights for low-rated senior securitization exposures.\n» Internal ratings-based approach incorporates tranche maturity as an extra risk\ndriver while the external ratings-based approach incorporates maturity and tranche\nthickness as extra risk drivers.\nWhile developing the final standard, the Committee considered the comments received on its three\nconsultative documents, along with the results of the quantitative impact studies conducted during the\nconsultations. With this document, the Committee has finalized the final standard for alternative capital\ntreatment of STC securitizations. Only non-ABCP, traditional securitizations are within the scope of the\nSTC framework. However, the Committee is still considering how STC criteria for short-term securitizations\nand ABCP conduits/programs should be developed and how to incorporate these criteria into the revised\nsecuritization framework.\nThe securitizations that meet the STC criteria are expected to be structurally sound and exhibit lower\nriskiness. Thus, STC securitization transactions are eligible for a more favorable capital treatment under the\nBasel capital framework. Therefore, the prescribed risk weights and risk-weight caps for the STC-compliant\nsecuritizations are lower and these exposures are expected to lead to lower capital requirements, when\ncompared to the non-STC-compliant securitization exposures. Whether an institution can take advantage\nof this capital relief depends on the discretion of its respective jurisdiction. Jurisdictions that believe the\noperational burden of implementing the STC framework exceeds the benefits that can be derived from\nits implementation retain the option not to implement the STC framework. This framework implies that\nonly institutions in jurisdictions that permit the use of STC framework can benefit from the lower capital\nrequirements. This framework does not seem to be conducive toward promoting a level playing field and can\ntip the balance for securitization markets in certain regions.\nThe next sections of this paper describe the hierarchy of approaches in the Basel III securitization framework\nand explain the calculation of capital requirements using the three prescribed approaches in the hierarchy\n(for both STC-compliant and non-STC securitizations). It also briefly covers the capital treatment of\nresecuritization exposures.\n4 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n2. Hierarchy of approaches\nUnder Basel III, the hierarchy within the securitization framework consists of three approaches: the internal\nratings-based approach (IRBA), the external ratings-based approach (ERBA), and the standardized approach\n(SA). The IRBA is at the top of the hierarchy, as shown in Figure 3. To use IRBA, a bank needs supervisory\napproval for the type of underlying exposures in the securitization pool, along with sufficient information\nto estimate K (which is the exposure-weighted average capital charge for the underlying pool). A bank\nIRB\nthat cannot use the IRBA can use ERBA, provided the exposure is rated (or has an inferred rating that meets\noperational requirements) and the jurisdiction permits the use of ratings for regulatory purpose. However, if a\nbank cannot use IRBA or ERBA, it must use the SA.\nFigure 3. Hierarchy of approaches in the revised framework\nEconomic inputs\nDefault and recovery database\nHigh-yield spreads\nDefault Recovery Ratings Unemployment\ndata data data rates\nDefault research Default and rating analytics website\nAnnual Monthly Historical default rates Forecasted default rates\ndefault study default study\nHistorical transition rates Forecasted transition rates\nAnd more\nIn general, a bank that cannot use either of these three approaches for a given securitization exposure would\nassign a risk weight of 1,250% to that exposure. Originator banks can reduce these exposures by the amount\nof their specific provisions on underlying assets of that transaction and non-refundable purchase price\ndiscounts on such underlying assets. In short, securitization exposures are treated differently, depending on\nthe type of underlying exposures and the type of information available to a bank. The securitization exposures\nof different pools using this hierarchy of approaches have been defined in the following section.\nIRB pool\nA securitization pool for which a bank must use IRBA to calculate capital requirements for all underlying\nexposures, provided there is sufficient information and approval to apply IRBA for that exposure type. If\na bank cannot estimate capital requirements using IRBA for all underlying exposures, for which it has a\nsupervisor approval, the bank would be expected to demonstrate to its supervisor why it cannot do so.\nHowever, a supervisor might prohibit a bank from treating an IRB pool as such with particular structures or\ntransactions. This approach includes transactions with highly complex loss allocations, tranches whose credit\nenhancement could be eroded for reasons other than portfolio losses, and tranches of portfolios with high\ninternal correlations. For example, portfolios with high exposure to single sectors or with high\ngeographical concentration.\n5 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nSA pool\nA securitization pool for which a bank does not have approval to calculate IRB parameters for any underlying\nexposures, is unable to calculate IRB parameters for any underlying exposures because of a lack of relevant\ndata, or prohibited by its supervisor from treating the pool as an IRB pool. For jurisdictions that permit the\nuse of external ratings, the following approaches can be used:\n» Use ERBA if the exposures have an external credit assessment or an inferred rating that meets the specified\noperational requirements.1 An inferred rating can be derived from another eligible rating to another\ntranche that ranks junior or equal (that is, pari-passu).\n» Use Internal Assessment Approach (IAA) for an unrated securitization exposure to an SA pool within an\nABCP program (for example, liquidity facilities and credit enhancements). To use an IAA, a bank must have\nsupervisory approval to use the IRB approach.\nMixed pool\nA securitization pool for which a bank can calculate IRB parameters for some, but not all, underlying\nexposures in a securitization. If a bank cannot calculate K for at least 95% of underlying exposure amounts\nIRB\nof a securitization, the bank is required to use the hierarchy for securitization exposures of SA pools. However,\nwhen a bank can calculate K for at least 95% of the underlying exposures:\nIRB\n» For the IRBA pool, the capital charge = K × % of underlying exposure for which K can be calculated\nIRB IRB\n» For the SA pool, the capital charge = K × (1 – % of underlying exposure for which K can be calculated)\nSA IRB\n1 For operational requirements on ERBA, refer to paragraphs 71 to 73 of the final Basel standard on securitization framework (link)\n6 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n3. Capital requirements calculation: An overview\nThe capital requirements for securitization exposures are calculated for both STC-compliant and other\nexposures while the capital treatment for both of these securitization types varies. The risk-weighted asset\namount of a securitization exposure is computed by multiplying the exposure amount by the appropriate risk\nweight, determined in accordance with the hierarchy of approaches. The exposure amount of a securitization\nexposure is the sum of the on-balance sheet exposure amount, or carrying value, and the off-balance sheet\nexposure amount2, where applicable. Carrying value accounts for purchase discounts and write-downs/\nspecific provisions the bank took on the securitization exposure. The final standard also specifies the\ntreatment of overlapping exposures3, along with the caps for securitization exposures (risk-weight caps for\nsenior exposures and overall caps) and alternative capital treatment for STC-compliant exposures.\n3.1 Caps for non-STC securitization exposures\nThe Basel Committee has now set the risk weight floor to 15%, reducing it from the 20% floor proposed\nin the first consultation document. In the current securitization framework, the risk-weight floor is 7%\nfor senior, granular securitization exposures under the IRB and 20% under the SA. Senior securitization\nexposures receive a maximum risk weight equal to the exposure-weighted average risk weight applicable to\nthe underlying exposures, determined using a look-through approach, provided the bank always knows the\ncomposition of the underlying exposures. For banks using the IRB framework, exposure-weighted average risk\nweight accounts for the scaling factor of 1.06 for the unexpected loss portion, and is inclusive of the expected\nloss portion multiplied by 12.5. If a bank uses SA or IRBA exclusively, the risk-weight cap for senior exposures\nwould equal the exposure-weighted average risk weight applicable to the underlying exposures under IRBA\nor SA. When applying SA or ERBA with mixed pools, the risk-weight cap for senior exposures would be based\non the SA exposure-weighted average risk weight of the underlying assets, whether they are originally IRB, or\nnot. Where the risk-weight cap results in a lower risk weight than the floor risk weight of 15%, the risk weight\nresulting from the cap is used.\nSimilarly, the maximum capital requirement for the securitization exposures a bank holds is equal to the SA\nor IRBA capital requirement (corresponding to the underlying pool being SA or IRBA) against the underlying\nexposures, had they not been securitized and treated under the Basel II general credit risk framework. For\nbanks using the IRBA framework, the capital requirement account for the scaling factor of 1.06 for the\nunexpected loss portion is inclusive of the expected loss portion multiplied by 12.5. In applying the capital\ncharge cap, the entire amount of any gain on sale and credit-enhancing interest-only strips arising from the\nsecuritization transaction is deducted.\n3.2 Criteria of simplicity, transparency, and comparability\nThe most recent July 2016 update of the securitization standard specifies alternative capital treatment for\nsecuritizations that meet the STC criteria. STC securitizations qualifying for this differentiated regulatory\ncapital treatment meet both the BCBS-IOSCO July 2015 STC criteria and the additional criteria for capital\npurposes (D15 and D16)4. The expanded set of criteria is referred to as the STC criteria for regulatory capital\npurposes and it includes the following new criteria:\n2 For information on measuring off-balance sheet securitization exposure, refer to paragraph 20 of the final standard on securitization framework (link)\n3 For treatment of overlapping exposures, refer to paragraphs 39-41 of the final securitization standard (link)\n4 For STC criteria, refer to A1 to D16 in Annex 2 of the Basel III standard (link)\n7 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n» Criterion D15 specifies that if standardized risk weights for the underlying exposures exceed certain levels\nthen these higher-risk underlying exposures would not be able to qualify for alternative capital treatment\nas STC-compliant transactions.\n» Criterion D16 specifies a more explicit definition of granularity, under which no exposure comprises more\nthan 1% of the underlying pool.\nJurisdictions that consider that the cost of implementation of the STC framework exceeds potential benefits\nretain the option not to implement the STC framework. The final STC criteria cover asset risk and structural\nrisk, along with fiduciary and servicer risk. The criteria incorporate multiple requirements for underlying\nassets, including terms regarding granularity, homogeneity, transparency, performance history, and risk\nweights. The criteria related to structural risk include requirements for clear disclosure, underwriting\nstandards, payment and voting rights, limited interest rate and currency exposure, and the presence of\nrisk retention. The STC criteria also accounts for an originator’s experience while requiring robust reporting\ncapabilities and guidelines for the servicer. The fulfillment of these criteria helps mitigate uncertainty related\nto asset risk, structural risk, governance, and operational risk. Therefore, securitizations that qualify as STC-\ncompliant carry a lower capital charge.\nThe final standard requires that originators or sponsors must disclose to investors all necessary information\nto allow investors to determine whether a securitization is STC-compliant. Investors then must consider this\ninformation to make their own assessment of the securitization’s STC compliance status, before applying the\nspecified alternative capital treatment. Although originators would be liable if there are misrepresentations or\ninaccurate information, the investors and holders of securitization positions are expected to track whether a\nnew development changes the STC compliance status of a securitization. If a supervisor is unsatisfied with a\nbank’s determination that a given transaction satisfies the STC criteria, it can take remedial action. One such\naction could be the denial of preferential regulatory capital treatment to that transaction and potentially\nothers as well.\n8 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n4. Capital treatment of securitization exposures\nThe Basel framework requires banks to hold regulatory capital for securitization exposures. These include\nexposures arising from the provision of credit risk mitigants to a securitization transaction, investments in\nasset-backed securities, retention of a subordinated tranche, and extension of a liquidity facility or credit\nenhancement. Banks can calculate these capital requirements using the hierarchy of approaches specified\nin the Basel III securitization framework. Also, the most recent July 2016 update of the Basel Committee\nsecuritization standard specifies alternative capital treatment for securitizations that meet the STC criteria.\nUnder all three approaches in the hierarchy, the risk weight for STC-complaint securitizations is subject to\na floor of 10% for senior tranches and 15% for non-senior tranches. Overall, the final calibration using the\nweighted-average SA capital charge for the underlying exposures in the pool is intended to produce capital\nrequirements that are slightly higher than exposures generated by the IRBA and roughly comparable to\nexposures generated under the ERBA.\n4.1 Internal ratings-based approach\nIn the IRBA, as under the current supervisory formula approach (SFA), the capital requirement depends on the\ncredit enhancement level and tranche thickness, along with the calculation of KIRB. In addition, the capital\ncharge would be based on certain inputs that determine the “p” parameter.\nInputs required\nTo calculate capital requirements for a securitization exposure to an IRB pool, a bank must use the IRBA,\nalong with several inputs that follow:\n» K is the exposure-weighted average capital charge of the underlying pool. The capital charge\nIRB\nincorporates both the expected loss portion and, where applicable, dilution risk5. The charge is\ncalculated in accordance with the applicable minimum IRB standards of the Basel framework, assuming\nthe underlying exposures in the pool were held directly by the bank. It reflects the effects of any credit\nrisk mitigant that is applied on the underlying exposures (either individually or to the entire pool). For\nstructures involving an SPE, all the SPE’s exposures related to the securitization are treated as exposures\nin the pool, unless the bank can demonstrate to its national supervisor that the risk of the SPE’s exposures\nis immaterial or that it does not affect the bank’s securitization exposure. Any specific provision and\nnon-refundable purchase price discount are not considered in the KIRB calculation, instead these\ncalculations should be based on the gross amounts of the exposures.\n» Tranche attachment point (A) represents the threshold at which credit losses within the underlying pool\nwould first be allocated to the exposure. It equals the greater of zero and the ratio of:\n– The outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitization, minus the outstanding balance of\nall tranches that rank senior or equal (pari passu) to the tranche that contains the securitization exposure\nof the bank (including the exposure itself), to\n– The outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitization\n5 Dilution refers to the possibility that the receivable amount is reduced through cash or non-cash credit to the receivable’s obligor. Dilution risk in a\nsecuritization must be recognized if it is not immaterial. Refer to paragraph 369 from Basel II framework for additional context (link)\n9 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n» Tranche detachment point (D) represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to a\nsecuritization exposure result in a total loss of principal for the tranche. D equals the greater of zero and\nthe ratio of:\n– The outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitization minus the outstanding balance of\nall tranches that rank senior to the tranche that contains the securitization exposure of the bank, to\n– The outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitization\nFor calculation of A and D, over-collateralization and funded reserve accounts are recognized as tranches and\nthe assets forming reserve accounts acts as their underlying assets (unfunded reserve accounts not included).\n» Supervisory parameter (p) determines the overall level of capital required for the portion of tranches\nthat reside above securitization exposures that absorb losses up to the amount of capital that would\nbe required if the underlying exposures are held directly by the bank. If the underlying IRB pool consists\nof both retail and wholesale exposures, a separate p-parameter is calculated for each pool and the\np-parameters are weighted by the nominal size of the exposures in each subpool to calculate a weighted\naverage p-parameter.\nNon-STC securitizations:\nSTC-compliant securitizations:\n– 0.3 is the p-parameter floor\n– N is the effective number of loans in the underlying pool, calculated as shown in Appendix A\n– K is the capital charge of the underlying pool\nIRB\n– LGD is the exposure-weighted average loss-given-default of the underlying pool, calculated as shown in\nAppendix A\n– MT is the remaining effective maturity of the tranche, calculated as shown in Appendix A\n– Parameters A, B, C, D, and E are determined according to the look-up table in Figure 4:\nFigure 4. Look-up values for parameters A, B, C, D, and E\nTerm Definition A B C D E\nSenior, granular (N ≥ 25) 0.00 3.56 –1.85 0.55 0.07\nSenior, non-granular (N < 25) 0.11 2.61 –2.91 0.68 0.07\nWholesale\nNon-senior, granular (N ≥ 25) 0.16 2.87 –1.03 0.21 0.07\nNon-senior, non-granular (N < 25) 0.22 2.35 –2.46 0.48 0.07\nSenior 0.00 0.00 –7.48 0.71 0.24\nRetail\nNon-senior 0.00 0.00 –5.78 0.55 0.27\nIf the portfolio share associated with the largest exposure is no more than 3% of the underlying pool, banks\ncan employ a simplified method for calculating N and LGD. Refer to Appendix A for details.\nCalculation of risk weight. For calculating capital requirements per unit of securitization exposure:\nwhere\n, and e = 2.71828 (base of natural logarithms)\n10 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nNext, the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure (subject to a floor of 15%) will be calculated\nas follows:\n4.2 External ratings-based approach\nUnder the ERBA, the risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying securitization exposure amounts\nby the appropriate risk weights. Also, the operational criteria6 for use of external credit assessments or for\ninferred ratings must also be met. For exposures with short-term ratings, or when inferred ratings based on\nshort-term ratings are available, the prescribed risk weights apply. For exposures with long-term ratings, or\nwhen inferred ratings based on long-term ratings are available, the risk weights depend on:\n» External rating grade or available inferred rating\n» Seniority of the position\n» Tranche maturity\n» Tranche thickness, in the case of non-senior tranches\nThe final standard adopts a simplified approach requiring the risk weights to be directly looked up from\na table, depending on rating seniority and maturity. Different risk weights have been prescribed for both,\nsecuritizations that are non-STC and that are STC-compliant (refer to Figure 6 to Figure 8 in Appendix B).\nHowever, the final standard has reduced the risk weights for longer-maturity tranches. The credit rating\nthreshold at which a 1,250% risk weight is automatically required has also been revised from below “BB-“\nor below investment grade (that is, “BBB-“) to below “CCC-“, particularly for senior tranches, where the\nrisk weights would increase more gradually than under the current standards. Furthermore, no granularity\nadjustments are applied, as the Committee believes that the credit rating agencies already account for\ngranularity when assigning a rating to a tranche. The risk weights must be adjusted for tranche maturity and,\nin the case of non-senior tranches, thickness, as the empirical analysis reflects that the effects of the risk\nweights are not fully reflected in the ratings:\n» Adjustment for tranche maturity. Tranche maturity (MT) is the tranche’s remaining effective maturity\nin years. MT has a floor of one year and a cap of five years and risk weights are linearly interpolated for\nmaturities between one and five years. Refer to Appendix A for method of calculating MT.\n» Adjustment of non-senior tranches for tranche thickness. The calculated risk weight is subject to a\nfloor of 15% and will not be lower than the risk weight corresponding to a senior tranche of the same\nsecuritization with the same rating and maturity.\nwhere,\nTranche thickness, T = D – A\nThe requirement for having at least two eligible ratings is no longer applicable. Also, a bank might use the\nInternal Assessment Approach, or IAA, for capitalizing the securitization exposures that it extends to ABCP\nprograms (for example, liquidity facilities and credit enhancements), if the bank has the supervisory approval\n6 For operational requirements for ERBA, refer to paragraphs 71 to 73 of the Basel standard on securitization framework (link)\n11 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nto use its internal assessments and it meets the required operational requirements7. Internal assessments\nof exposures provided to ABCP programs are mapped to equivalent external ratings of an External Credit\nAssessment Institution (ECAI). Then, these rating equivalents are used to determine the appropriate risk\nweights under the ERBA for the exposures.\n4.3 Standardized approach\nTo calculate capital requirements for a non-STC securitization exposure to an SA pool using the standardized\napproach, a bank would use a supervisory formula and the following bank-supplied inputs:\n» K : The weighted-average capital charge of the entire portfolio of underlying exposures. A provision or\nSA\na non-refundable purchase price discount on an exposure in the pool must be excluded from the K\nSA\ncalculation.\n» W: The ratio of delinquent underlying exposures to total underlying exposures in the securitization pool.\nDelinquent underlying exposures are underlying exposures that are 90 days or more past due.\n» The tranche attachment point A and the tranche detachment point D (A and D were defined in Section 4.1\non IRBA). If the only difference between exposures to a transaction is related to maturity, A and D will be\nthe same.\nCalculation of risk weight\nThe supervisory parameter p in the context of SA equals 1 (or 0.5 for STC-compliant securitizations) for a\nsecuritization exposure that is not a resecuritization exposure. Capital requirements per unit of securitization\nexposure:\nwhere\nIf a bank does not know the delinquency status for up to 5% of underlying exposures in the pool, SA may\nstill be used to calculate the capital requirements for each unit of securitization exposure by adjusting the\nK calculation (as mentioned in the preceding formula). However, if a bank does not know the delinquency\nA\nstatus for more than 5%, the securitization exposure must be risk-weighted at 1,250%. Risk weight assigned\nto a securitization exposure (subject to a floor of 15%) is calculated as follows:\nWhen a bank applies SA to an unrated junior exposure in a transaction where the more senior tranches are\nrated and therefore no rating can be inferred for the junior exposure, the resulting risk weight under SA for\nthe junior unrated exposure must not be lower than the risk weight for the next, more senior rated exposure.\n7 For operational requirements on IAA, refer to paragraph 75 of the final Basel standard on securitization framework (link)\n12 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n5. Capital treatment of resecuritization exposures\nOther than a 1,250% risk weight, a version of the standardized approach is the only approach allowed for\nresecuritization exposures, with the following adjustments:\n» The capital requirement of the underlying securitization exposures is calculated using the\nsecuritization framework\n» Delinquencies (W) are assumed to be zero for any securitization exposure to a tranche in the\nunderlying pool\n» The supervisory parameter “p” is set equal to 1.5, rather than 1.0, as for securitization exposures\nRisk weights and capital requirements caps defined for securitizations are not applicable to resecuritization\nexposures. If the underlying portfolio of a resecuritization consists in a pool of exposures to securitization\ntranches and to other assets, securitization tranches are separated from the exposures to assets that are\nnot securitizations. Separate K parameters are calculated for each subset and the KA for the portfolio is\nA\ncalculated as the nominal exposure weighted average of the KA for each subset considered. The resulting risk\nweight is subject to a floor risk weight of 100%.\n13 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\n6. Basel III securitization framework: A\nstep forward\nOverall, this final Basel III securitization framework is intended as an improvement to the existing Basel II\nframework. The Basel III securitization approach hierarchy, covering both securitization (STC and non-STC)\nand resecuritization exposures, has been simplified and made more risk-sensitive. As per the final risk-\nweight calibration, SA capital charge for the underlying exposures in the pool is intended to produce capital\nrequirements that are slightly higher than those generated by the IRBA and roughly comparable to those\ngenerated under the ERBA. Moreover, the July 2016 update of the final standard specifies alternative capital\ntreatment, with lower risk-weight floors, for STC securitizations.\n14 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nAppendix A. Calculation of tranche maturity and\nloss given default\nBelow are the methods for calculating parameters such as tranche maturity (for IRBA and ERBA), effective\nnumber of exposures (for IRBA), and exposure-weighted LGD (for IRBA).\nTranche maturity\nTranche maturity MT has a floor of one year and a cap of five years and it can be measured as follows, at a\nbank’s discretion:\n» On the basis of weighted-average maturity of the contractual cash flows of the tranche as\nwhere CF denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments, and fees)\nt\ncontractually payable8 by the borrower in period t\n» On the basis of final legal maturity of the tranche, as where ML is the final\nlegal maturity of the tranche\nFor credit protection instruments that are only exposed to losses that occur up to the maturity of that\ninstrument, a bank would be allowed to apply the contractual maturity of the instrument and would not\nhave to look through to the protected position\nEffective number of exposures (N) and exposure-weighted average LGD\n» If the portfolio share associated with the largest exposure is up to 0.03 or 3% of the underlying pool, banks\ncan employ a simplified method for calculating N and LGD otherwise they will use the regular method. The\ntwo methods of calculating N and LGD follow:\n» Regular method: and where EADi is\nexposure-at-default associated with the ith instrument in the pool (multiple exposures to the same obligor\nmust be treated as a single instrument) and LGD is average LGD9 associated with all exposures to the ith\ni\nobligor\n» Simplified method (C1<0.03): and\nLGD = 0.50 where C is share of the pool corresponding to the sum of the largest “m” exposures (the level\nm\nof m is set by each bank) and C is portfolio share of the largest exposure. N = 1 / C when only C\n1 1 1\nis available.\n8 The contractual payments must be unconditional and must not be dependent on the actual performance of the securitized assets. If such\nunconditional contractual payment dates are not available, the final legal maturity shall be used.\n9 When default and dilution risks for purchased receivables are treated in an aggregate manner within a securitization, the LGD input should be\nconstructed as a weighted average of the LGD for default risk and the 100% LGD for dilution risk. The weights are the stand-alone IRB capital charges\nfor default risk and dilution risk, respectively.\n15 JANUARY 2017 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS UNDER THE REVISED SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORKMOODY’S ANALYTICS\nAppendix B.
