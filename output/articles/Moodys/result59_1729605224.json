While large banks tend to benefit from\nhigher interest rates, as they enable them to increase their net interest margin, medium-sized and digital\nbanks – which tend to rely more on savings deposits than loans – will find it more difficult to widen their\nmargins. Additionally, venture capital funding is slowing in the current economic climate. The downturn will\nalso trigger increased defaults, which could be skewed to smaller and medium-sized businesses, again\nimpacting digital banks harder than traditional ones. As a result, consolidation and further failures in the\ndigital banking sector are expected.\n“With substantial inflationary pressure, rising\nThe current economic interest rates and decreasing trading valuations,\nuncertainty is obviously a businesses are faced with the need to adapt\nkey challenge for us ...

We are recalibrating our strategy towards\nprofitability, and then being in a position to best assess the market environment in the future.”\nHaving withdrawn from the UK in April 2020\n22 growth and from the US in November 2021, N26 is now\n%\nfocusing on Europe – in particular Germany, France,\nin Atom Bank’s business and Italy, Spain and its expansion into eastern Europe.\nresidential loan book\n“We expect to see further shifts in market share\nthis financial year\nas global venture capital funding in the tech space\ncontinues to slow, which will likely include a wave\nof consolidation,” says Weber. “We see this as an opportunity to increase market share, especially as we\nanticipate the adoption of digital banking to continue to accelerate.”\nUK-based Atom Bank aims to become the fastest-growing lender in the UK, according to its chief risk\nofficer (CRO) Rebecca Cartwright. Founded in 2014, Atom Bank was the UK’s first digital-only bank to be\ngranted a regulatory licence. Its business and residential loan book grew by 22% over this financial year,\nreaching £3.3 billion ($3.8 billion). Atom achieved its first monthly operating profit in the first quarter of this\nfinancial year, followed by three further consecutive quarters of operating profit up to March 31, 2022.\nMeanwhile, TymeBank, which has 5 million retail\nclients and 100,000 business customers, has\nProfitability is one of\nambitious plans to add upwards of one million\nour key priorities over the next\ncustomers per year, a strategy that owes much\nfive years\nto cloud-based technology. “Being hosted in the\ncloud means we don’t have any limitations, so we Alexander Weber, N26\ncan scale at a rapid pace while maintaining high\nlevels of customer service,” says Bruce Paveley,\nTymeBank’s chief technology officer (CTO).\nJanuary 2023 3Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nKey priorities\nAs well as targeting growth, another major priority\nfor digital banks is speedy credit decisioning to Of course, pricing is a\nonboard customers quickly and efficiently. This factor with businesses when\ndistinguishes digital banks from traditional banks, it comes to borrowing, but the\nwhere the process is notoriously time-consuming. thing they tend to care about\nmost is speed ...

Behind the automated decisioning software, banks will run credit risk analysis to help\ninform their credit decisions. OakNorth Bank, for example, uses its parent company’s ON Credit Intelligence\nsuite, which is also packaged up and licensed as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution to other banks.\nOakNorth Bank launched with a full banking licence\nThe major priority in 2015 and targets what it calls the “missing\nmiddle” businesses, offering loans that range from\nis further investment in\n£250,0000 – the level where automated decisions\ntechnology-driven automation,\ngenerally stop – to around £70 million, where\nas well as development\nfull bespoke analysis starts.

We constantly look at what upgrades\nand app updates would make the process better and ultimately result in optimal rates on our savings and\nmortgage products.”\nAnother objective for many digital banks is to increase the numbers of customers using their account as a\nprimary, rather than an additional, account.\n“At N26, our goal is that every improvement in our product excites and encourages customers to use their\nN26 account more and more as their primary bank account,” says Weber. The strategy includes moving\nbeyond “everyday money management” into products that help customers grow their wealth, such as\noffering investment opportunities and automated savings functionalities. In Germany, N26’s most mature\nmarket, one in two customers that use N26 regularly use it as their main account, Weber says.\nAchieving ever-higher levels of automation is key for most digital banks, which often view themselves\nas technology firms as well as banks. “We automate everything from our infrastructure to our access\nmanagement with code,” says Thomas Grosse, chief banking officer and CRO at N26. “We model\nourselves as a technology company with agile software development, which requires hundreds of\ndeployments weekly.”\n3 January 2023 4Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nCloud-native\nIn May 2016, OakNorth Bank became the first\nEuropean bank to be fully cloud-hosted, paving Benefits of being cloud-native\nthe way for a multitude of others to follow suit. “We\nworked very closely with Amazon Web Services [AWS] • Avoids the technological and regulatory\nand the regulators around things such as data challenges of moving data to the cloud\ncontinuity, privacy and security to help drivethe\n• Cost-efficiency: pay only for what you use,\nchange in the industry forward,” says Kristensen.\nswitch components on and off\n• Flexibility: the ability to change and\nPrior to that, the regulatory environment had not\nadd components\nexisted in Europe that allowed banks to have their\ncore systems in the cloud.

Firms can avoid the “expensive, time- forms, including unstructured\nconsuming and risky” task of migrating data from data, into the data lake and\nan on-premise system to the cloud, which is also\ntransform when we know what questions\ncomplex from a regulatory perspective.

Andy Sturrock, Atom Bank\nJanuary 2023 5Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nThere are also cost advantages. “With the cloud\nwe only pay for what we need, and can dial up and We worked very closely\ndown depending on our growth,” says Neil Evans, with AWS and the regulators\nhead of credit risk at OakNorth Bank. “There’s a around things such as data\nlot of flexibility that we simply wouldn’t get if we\ncontinuity, privacy and security\nweren’t cloud-hosted.”\nto help drive the change in the\nindustry forward\nBeing in the cloud also allows new ways of\nworking with data, including a move away from Valentina Kristensen, OakNorth Bank\nthe extract, transform, load model in which data\nis transformed before being loaded into storage,\nsays Andy Sturrock, CTO at Atom Bank. “The extract, transform, load method is fine as long as you know\nexactly what questions you want the data to answer. Otherwise you risk discarding data you might need\nlater,” says Sturrock. “The big data way – extract, transform, load – allows us to dump all the data in all\nits forms, including unstructured data, into the data lake and transform when we know what questions we\nwant to ask. The cloud really helps with that.”\nThe cloud also allows digital banks to scale rapidly. N26 was another early mover when it came to\ntransferring its core banking business into the cloud. “Doing this at a time it was not industry standard in\nbanking allowed us to scale our business at speed as we continued to build out our product,” says Grosse.\n“Without legacy systems, owned infrastructure or costly branch operations, we’ve been able to rapidly\nscale and grow from the moment we obtained our own banking licence in 2016.”\nBeing fully in the cloud certainly helps when it comes to costs. In this financial year, Atom Bank, for\nexample, grew its income by more than 200%, but costs rose by just 6%. Being highly automated and\nin the cloud played a part in this, says Cartwright. “We don’t have branches and aren’t weighed down\nby legacy tech like other big banks,” she says. “Our digitally native model allows us to be lean and keep\nheadcount low, so we can control our costs while simultaneously growing the business.”\nShe adds that Atom Bank’s relatively low costs are also down to its focus on saving and lending – activities\nthat drive revenue – rather than transactional banking, which creates costs.\n5 January 2023 6Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nBanking platforms\nMany digital banks will partner with a core banking platform provider – Alkami, Finflux Fintech OS, Mambu\nor BankPoint, for example – as a way of launching their services.\nDigital banks work with these fintech companies to varying degrees. At one end of the spectrum, they build\neverything online themselves and, at the other, outsource all their core banking to a platform provider. Many\ndigital banks inhabit the middle ground, where they partner with a banking platform while building a lot of\ntheir own tech stack around it.\nAtom Bank, for example, uses Thought Machine for its core banking platform and builds its own intellectual\nproperty on top. “You need to make a decision where in the stack you want to be,” says Sturrock. “It’s\nabout how flexible you want to be versus how much work you want to take on in-house.”\nGrowth and scalability\nBuilding an IT stack in the cloud allows digital banks to start with the bare essentials and build out later\nas the business grows. When TymeBank built its IT platform on AWS, its main priority was designing\nits products to be accessible to customers. “The main driver for us is availability of our products to\ncustomers – that must always work. So reliability and resilience are essential,” says Paveley.\nTo achieve this, the bank looked to enhance its technology stack, which it continues to refine. “We\nare always looking at the new features and functions [AWS] supply,” says Paveley. “This allows us to\nevaluate almost on a monthly basis where we can enhance our builds to enable our growth and customer\nacquisition strategy.”\nJanuary 2023 7Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nCase study: the growth journey of a neobank for SMEs\nOakNorth Bank was founded by Rishi Khosla and Joel Perlman, two entrepreneurs who had first-hand\nknowledge of the difficulties of scaling-up small and medium-sized businesses to secure the loans\nthey needed. The firm was set up specifically to lend to an underserved group of companies that required\na banking licence to benefit from funding via retail deposits. This required the firm to work closely with the\nUK’s Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority to apply for a UK banking licence.\n“We needed to show the regulator that we had a clear plan for our system development and origination\nbusiness to demonstrate we had the bones of a business in place – the right people, the right systems,\nthe right processes – and that the hypothesis of our business model would work,” says Neil Evans, head\nof credit risk at OakNorth Bank. “We had a pretty clear vision from the outset of where we wanted to get\nto, including entry into the cloud.”\nThe bank’s initial tech stack included players such as Mambu, nCino (part of the Salesforce platform)\nand OakNorth Bank’s own commercial lending software (the ON Credit Intelligence Suite2). It has since\nevolved and developed further to include the likes of ComplyAdvantage and True Layer – all of which are\nhosted on the cloud. “We set up manually at first, but with every intention to grow our tech stack as we\ngrew the size of the book. We had already started to build our back-office and web-based systems so\nwe were ready to move into the cloud when the timing was right,” says Evans.\nIn March 2015, OakNorth Bank was granted its banking licence – only the third granted in the UK in\n150 years – and given approval to start operating on a ‘mobilisation’ basis. After exiting mobilisation and\nofficially launching in September 2015, OakNorth completed around £15 million ($18.38 million) in loans\nby the end of the year.\nIn May 2016, it became the first European bank to be fully cloud-hosted.\nBy the end of December 2016 – the bank’s first full year of operation – it had lent £276 million\n($308 million).\n“It was fast growth, so we had to be ready for it, but at that size it was still possible to keep all the data\nwe needed easily in one Excel spreadsheet,” says Evans.\nIn the following years, the bank more than doubled the number of borrowers and the level of debt on its\nbalance sheet each year. Loans rose from £900 million ($1.1 billion) in 2017 to £3.1 billion ($3.80 billion) in\n2019 to £4.2 billion ($5.14 billion) in 2021.\n“It grew quickly, and the system had to be\nable to support this and enable all the new 175,000\nsystem updates required,” says Evans. “It had\nsavings customers\nto quickly accommodate new solutions that\nhelped our origination as well as portfolio\nmanagement, and then be able to add things\n£3.3 billion\nin as new issues appeared: for example,\nclimate scenarios.” in deposits\nToday the bank has over 175,000 savings\ncustomers with £3.3 billion ($4.04 billion) in\n£8.5 billion\ndeposits, and several hundred commercial\nborrowers across the UK. It has lent £8.5 billion lent since 2015\n($10.41 billion) since inception.\nNotes\n2 OakNorth (2022), ON Credit Intelligence SuiteTM, https://bit.ly/3P9qcGH\n7 January 2023 8Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nData\nAs digital banks expand, so do their data\nrequirements. “The data we needed to start with The initial focus was on\nwas reasonably narrow,” says OakNorth Bank’s the key credit data needed for\nEvans. “The initial focus was on the key credit data our regulatory reporting. As\nneeded for our regulatory reporting. As we’ve built we’ve built the business, we’ve\nthe business, we’ve increasingly wanted to be able\nincreasingly wanted to be able to\nto better understand the market and analyse the\nbetter understand the market and analyse\nefficiency of our own processes.”\nthe efficiency of our own processes\nThe business wanted to understand, for example, Neil Evans, OakNorth Bank\nwhere sources of introduction were coming from\nand to see statistics on repeat business. “Those are\nthings that you can’t find in other bigger banks very\neasily,” he says. “Our system can ingest data from individual borrowers at the beginning and feed it through\nto our back-office system.”\nMachine learning has helped the bank move beyond simple data capture and storage to achieving better\nretrieval of data, says Evans. “We are able to respond, for example, to queries from investors or the\nregulator in days rather than weeks and months. This is because our data extraction is either ahead of the\ncurve already or easily able to adapt to new requests or new economic scenarios.”\nAs well as analysing its internal data, OakNorth Bank sources “hundreds of different datasets” from an\nenormous variety of sources, says Evans. “We try to really understand our customers’ business at a very\ngranular level using data and analytics to build up a very detailed picture, and then combine that with\nscenario analysis to constantly develop a forward-looking view of individual borrowers and how they might\nbe impacted under certain scenarios, so we can determine the risk in our book.”\nAs well as obtaining data from public bodies such as the UK’s Office for National Statistics, OakNorth\nBank also sources very specialist data in niche areas. “There are many areas you don’t necessarily think of\nstraight away as a data source that might be of use,” says Evans.\nHe gives the example of a European potential SaaS client that needed finance for a hotel in Spain.\nOvernight, the credit team produced a view of the hotel market in Barcelona. Part of that involved looking\nat the numbers of passengers coming through Barcelona airport and analysing how they split into different\ncountries and what happened at different times of the year to indicate occupancy levels in Barcelona hotels\nat different times.\n“Our data system is able to bring all of these formal and informal datasets together and apply an average,\naggregate view,” says Evans. “It goes beyond traditional credit metrics such as loan-to-value and debt\nservice to take in key performance indicators of businesses, and hence massively enhances the quality of\ndecisions we are able to make.”\nAs client information comes in a slew of different formats, data formatting and normalisation are essential,\nhe stresses.\nAtom Bank’s Cartwright sees obtaining data around climate risk as the next big focus for digital banks.\nAgain, being cloud-based gives digital firms an advantage when it comes to processing the huge swathes\nof data needed for climate risk analysis, she says. “I think being cloud-native and more agile, we have the\nedge over larger, more manual entities when it comes to analysing our clients’ creditworthiness against\ntransitional and physical climate risk.”\nJanuary 2023 9Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nAnalysis\nOakNorth Bank’s Evans describes two distinct types of analysis, illustrated below: first, customer origination\nand ensuring the credit decision is the right one from the start; and, second, monitoring the loan book and\napplying scenario analysis.\n“Applying this forward-looking analysis allows us to review our entire portfolio every month and pick out any\ncases that could be a concern six or 12 months down the line, rather than yesterday or three months ago,\nas happens in a lot of other banks,” Evans says.\nAnalytics\nCustomer and Ongoing credit\nloan origination monitoring\nElectronic know- Credit Customer Economic\nyour-customer (KYC) decisioning analysis analysis\nCustomer identification checks Credit ratings Historic data\nAnti-money laundering checks Behavioural data/ Scenario analysis\nforecasting\nBoth Atom Bank and OakNorth Bank do their own modelling, stress-testing, scenario analysis and credit\nrisk analysis. But, as many digital banks are under 10 years of age, they will need to obtain historical data\nexternally to analyse longer-term economic trends and customer behaviour.\nIt is important that historical data is overlaid with analysis of the current environment, says Atom Bank’s\nCartwright. “Today we have a whole generation of borrowers who have never experienced high inflation and\ninterest rates. So behaviourally, how they look at their discretionary spend versus essential spend, may be\ndifferent and we, as a digital bank, need to be really conscious of that because, by the very nature of being\ndigital, our demographic tends to be a younger demographic,” she says.\n9 January 2023 10Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth Digital banks | Harnessing technology to deliver growth\nRegulation\nAnother factor hugely affecting the technology\nbuild of digital banks is regulation. Keeping up Some of the legacy\nwith the nuances of financial regulation in different regulatory policies are very\njurisdictions – most of which originates from before local in nature and create\nthe digital era – is an ongoing technology challenge.\nchallenges in our pursuit of\n“Some of the legacy regulatory policies are very\nbuilding a strong and modular\nlocal in nature and create challenges in our pursuit\ntechnology platform\nof building a strong and modular technology\nplatform,” says N26’s Grosse. Thomas Grosse, N26\nIn Europe, examples include different local\nregulations around KYC rather than a common\nEuropean Union standard. Payment systems and methods also differ across countries. “[These] must\nbe individually addressed as part of our product to truly resonate locally,” says Grosse. Credit scoring\nand regulations also function differently across markets, meaning credit products must be approached\ndifferently across borders, he says.\nN26 considers it essential to have regulatory expertise in-house. “A big focus for us is strengthening our\nbench of internal experts, who focus not on a single market or sector, but have a broader view of regulation\nand the way it impacts us as a fully digital pan-European business in a landscape where regulation is built\naround banking as a nationalistic industry,” he says. In addition, for bigger European markets or markets\nwith higher complexity, the firm employs staff that liaise specifically with those regulators. In some cases\nit will also partner with “recognised and industry-leading partners” who can provide further expertise on\nrelevant topics.\nAdditionally, financial regulation – particularly\nWe don’t have the same regulatory reporting requirements – put a greater\nregulatory resources and huge load proportionately on smaller banks than bigger\nteams as large banks, so having banks with large regulatory teams.\nto comply with similar rules\n“We don’t have the same regulatory resources and\naround regulatory reporting, for\nhuge teams as large banks, so having to comply\nexample, is a huge strain on our resources\nwith similar rules around regulatory reporting, for\nValentina Kristensen, OakNorth Bank example, is a huge strain on our resources,” says\nOakNorth Bank’s Kristensen.\nCalculating capital requirements under Basel III’s\nCapital Adequacy rules, for example, is extremely onerous, with much at stake. Miscalculations could either\nmean a bank falling foul of the regulator or tying up capital unnecessarily. A huge amount of data is required\nfor the calculations, which could be extremely manual, slow and prone to error without the right tools.\nThis is one area in which digital banks might turn to\nthird-party tech firms for expertise.
