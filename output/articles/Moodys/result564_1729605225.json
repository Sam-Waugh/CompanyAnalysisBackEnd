Introduction\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is a concept that grew out of socially responsible investing. Socially\nresponsible investors have different views as to what constitutes socially responsible investments. One approach to\nresponsible investment is to direct investment dollars away from firms that produce products or services that lead to\ncontroversial ESG events, which are events viewed as detrimental to the public good (henceforth “ESG events”).\nESG events — a radiation leak at a nuclear power plant (Environmental), a manufacturer outsourcing assembly to a firm\nthat uses child labor (Societal), a firm paying a bribe for preferential access to a market (Governance) — are continually\ncollected into a variety of databases. Large companies are more likely to incur ESG events, and certain types of companies\nare more susceptible due to the nature of their businesses. In this paper, we assess whether a company is more likely to\nexperience ESG events, given its size and the nature of its business. Such an assessment can help investors and lenders gain\nfurther insight into the risk profiles of specific firms.\nCurrently, it is difficult to assess whether an ESG event is isolated or, rather, indicative of a broader cultural problem within a firm.\nIn this paper, we present a methodology to address this question. We use the term “ESG risk management culture” much the way\nthat the nuclear power industry uses the term \"culture of safety.\" The latter term was coined by the International Nuclear Safety\nAdvisory Group to help reduce accidents in nuclear power plants, defining a culture of safety as: \"The product of individual and\ngroup values attitudes, perceptions, competencies, and patterns of behavior that determine the commitment to, and the style and\nproficiency of an organization's health and safety management.\"1 We define an ESG risk management culture as the persistence\nwith which firms introduce, maintain, and update risk mitigation measures (strategic, organizational, or managerial) to mitigate\nenvironmental, social, and governance events detrimental to the public good. In this paper, we focus on the following hypotheses:\n1) Whether the risk of ESG event persists over time after controlling for sector size and region of the firm.\n2) Whether adoption of ESG policies can lead to a reduction of future ESG events\nWe address the first hypothesis using two ESG event datasets, Moody’s ESG controversy dataset and a dataset of ESG events\nprovided by RepRisk, a Zurich-based ESG data science firm.2 We demonstrate that firms with historically elevated ESG event rates\nrelative to firms of comparable size and in the same sector are more likely to experience ESG events in the future. 3\nWe address the second hypothesis by combining RepRisk data on ESG events with Moody’s ESG Assessment Scores. We interpret\nmarked improvement in a firm’s overall ESG score as indicative of a firm strengthening its ESG Risk Management practices. Using a\n“Difference-in-Differences” methodology, we find that companies can reduce their future risk of ESG events.\nEvidence of persistence in ESG event risk is consistent with two interpretations. The first is that the inherent characteristics of\nsome firms lead them to have more ESG events than others. The second is that a weak ESG risk management culture leads some\nfirms to have more ESG events than others. Evidence that firms that strengthen their ESG policies (as evidenced by better Moody’s\nESG Assessment Scores) reduce their rates of future ESG events is consistent with the second interpretation: At least a portion of\nthe observed persistence in ESG events can be attributed to differences in ESG risk management culture.\n1 NSAG's (1986) “Summary Report on the Post-Accident Review Meeting on the Chernobyl Accident.”\n2 RepRisk specializes in ESG and business conduct risk research and quantitative solutions. Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Switzerland, RepRisk\nleverages AI and machine learning technologies combined with human intelligence to analyze numerous public sources in 23 languages and to assess material\nESG incidents.

Academic Literature\nMuch has been written on ESG and responsible investing. Attention has focused on demonstrating that firms with “good” ESG\nratings outperform firms with “poor” ESG ratings. Academics have also researched the differences in ESG ratings produced by\ndifferent vendors.4 However, attention to whether ESG ratings in fact measure exposure to ESG risks and the management of such\nrisks has been more limited.\nGloßner (2018) investigates the persistence of ESG risks through a framework in which a big jump in the RepRisk Index (RRI) — a\nproprietary ESG metric that dynamically captures and quantifies an entity’s reputational risk exposure related to ESG issues — is\nindicative of “weak corporate social responsibility,” and “weak CSR” is persistent. Further, his interpretation of the results is that\nthe market misprices “weak CSR,” which is why avoiding firms with recent jumps in RRI leads to equity outperformance. 5\nEccles et al. (2014) identify a set of U.S. firms that adopted corporate policies related to environmental and social issues by 1993,\nbefore doing so became common. They match those firms to competitors with similar financial performance and characteristics,\nsuch as size, capital structure, and valuation, as of 1993. They find that firms that adopted sustainability policies outperformed\ntheir peers in the long run, doing better both in terms of the equity stock market and accounting metrics as of 2009.6 The\ninterpretation offered in the paper is that these firms — termed High Sustainability — differ in business conduct from their Low\nSustainability counterparts. Changing the way a firm operates is an inherently time-consuming process. Therefore, time is an\nimportant factor in determining the success of any policy or effort intended to reduce ESG risk. In other words, we expect ESG risks\nto be persistent.\n3. Data Description\nFor this study, we use three ESG datasets. We will describe each dataset in turn.\n1) RepRisk’s Incident Data is used to establish persistence of ESG events.\n2) Moody’s ESG Controversies are used to establish persistence as well as the responsiveness of a firm to ESG events.\n3) Moody’s ESG Assessment Scores are combined with ESG events data to establish that improvements in ESG policies and\nrisk management cultures can reduce the risk of future ESG events.\n3.1 RepRisk’s Incident Data\nOne dataset used to study the first hypothesis contains ESG events identified by RepRisk. RepRisk defines an ESG event as\n“incidents such as criticism, adverse business conduct issues, and scandals” (henceforth “Incidents”). RepRisk’s definition of ESG\nIncidents includes 28 types of issues that can have a reputational, compliance, or financial impact on a company. There are 28\nIssues based on international standards related to ESG issues and business conduct, such as: The World Bank Group\nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines; The International Finance Corporation Performance Standard; the Equator\nPrinciples; The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; and The International Labour Organization Conventions. In addition,\nRepRisk currently tracks 73 ESG Topic Tags that are specific and thematic, and that are linked together with at least one ESG Issue\nfor more granular risk analysis.7\n4 See for example, Christensen, Dane, George Serafeim, and Anywhere Sikochi, “Why is Corporate Virtue in the Eye of The Beholder? The Case of ESG Ratings.”\n(2019) Harvard Business School.

Koelbel and\nRoberto Rigobon, “Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings”, MIT Sloan School of Management, August 2019; and Kotsantonis, Sakis, and George\nSerafeim, \"Four Things No One Will Tell You About ESG Data.\" Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 31, no. 2 (Spring 2019): 50–58.\n5 Simon Gloßner “The Price of Ignoring ESG Risks.” Catholic University Eichstätt-Ingolstadt, Germany, May 18, 2018 (Doctoral Dissertation Chapter).\n6 Eccles, Robert G., Ioannis Ioannou, and George Serafeim, “The impact of corporate sustainability on organizational processes and performance.” Management\nScience,60, 2835–2857, 2014.\n7 RepRisk AG, “RepRisk Methodology Overview.” Privileged, April 2021, reprisk.com.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 4Along with the publication date of the source that flags the incident, RepRisk provides information on related countries, sectors,\nand related ESG Issues and assigns scores for three key parameters that characterize the incident: Severity, Reach, and Novelty.\nSeverity refers to the harshness of the incident. Reach refers to influence, based on readership/circulation, as well as importance in\nthe specific country of the information source, according to RepRisk’s own rating. Novelty touches on the newness of the issues\nthe entity faces.\nIncidents comprise the primary data that RepRisk produces. To quantify a firm’s overall reputational ESG risk, analysts use the ESG\nrisk incidents to derive a RepRisk Index, an algorithm intended to measure a firm’s ESG-related risk exposure.\nThe sample of companies for our analysis comprises the Moody’s Investors Service rated universe. Of the 4,324 firms that have\never received a credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service, RepRisk’s database contains at least one ESG incident for 3,268 firms.\nFurther, we require time-matched information on the size, location, and sector of each firm, leaving us with a final sample of 3,181\nfirms.\nFigure 1A presents the coverage of incidents and the ratio of incidents per firm across years. The increase in incident counts from\n2007 until 2015 reflects a number of data features. First, RepRisk expanded its coverage of media and stakeholder sources and\nbroadened language coverage during this period. Second, recent, surging interest in ESG likely led to more vigorous media\ncoverage of ESG incidents. Third, the expanding availability of social media, as well as RepRisk improving its search algorithm,\nlikely also increased ESG incident coverage. On the other hand, we see a decrease in the incidents per firm ratio from 2017\nonward. In general, declining incidents could indicate more companies trying to improve their ESG behavior. Last, the lower\nincident count from 2020 occurs because our dataset contains information only until July 2020.\nFigure 1B presents the distribution by firm size measured in Total Assets (USD). The sample includes a suitable cross-section of\nboth larger and smaller firms. There is a considerable spike in the incidents-per-firm ratio for large firms, which we expect, because\nlarger firms have wider media coverage.\nFigure 1 RepRisk Incident Data Coverage.\nFigure 1D presents\ngeographic incident\ndistribution. We classify the\n71 different countries in the\ndataset into four regions,\nwhere country refers to\nheadquarter location. Since\nour focus is the rated\nuniverse, firms from the\nU.S. are heavily\nrepresented. The ratio of\nincidents per firm varies\nsignificantly across regions,\nwith Europe showing the\nhighest incident-per-firm\nratio. This trait is due to\ncountries such as\nSwitzerland and Germany\nposting the highest ratio of\nincidents-per-firm, which\nmay reflect more ESG\nawareness in that region.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 53.2 Moody’s ESG Solutions’ Controversies and ESG Scores\nThe datasets used to demonstrate the robustness of the persistence effect and test the second hypothesis of this study\ncome from Moody’s ESG Solutions. Moody’s ESG Solutions is a business unit of Moody’s Corporation that serves the\ngrowing global demand for ESG and climate insights. Moody’s ESG Solutions’ data and insights include an ESG Controversy\ndataset and ESG Scores, that we leverage for this study. This section contains an overview of each of these resources.\nMoody’s ESG Controversy Data\nMoody’s ESG Solutions identifies companies’ involvements in ESG events, referred to as “Controversies.” Controversies\nform a part of Moody’s ESG solution suite and are a direct input into Moody’s ESG Assessment Scores and several other\nspecialized assessments. Moody’s screens a pre-defined population of companies daily, currently covering 10,000 +\ncompanies regarding their involvement in ESG controversies across 38 ESG issues. These 38 ESG issues are derived from\ninternational norms and standards related to ESG issues and business conduct, such as: The Ten Principles of the Global\nCompact of the United Nations, The World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines; The International Finance\nCorporation Performance Standard; The Equator Principles; The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; and The\nInternational Labour Organization Conventions to name a few. This dataset currently contains over 20,000 entries across the\nbroad range of ESG issues, with coverage going back to 2007.\nAlong with the date of the controversy, and the ESG issues involved, this dataset contains information on related countries,\nand sectors, and assigns scores for three key parameters that characterize the controversy: Severity, Responsiveness, and\nMitigation. Severity concerns the harshness of the controversy. Responsiveness touches on the reaction and efforts of the\nfirm towards managing the risks inherent to the controversy. Mitigation refers to the outcome of the firm’s actions towards\nreducing the risks caused by the controversy. The three parameters and each event are reviewed by a team of ESG analysts\naccording to Moody’s ESG Solutions assessment.\nOf the 4,324 firms that have ever received a credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service, Moody’s ESG Controversy Data\ncontains at least one ESG controversy and time-matched information about the size, location, and sector for 2,260 firms.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 6Figure 2 Moody’s ESG Controversy Data Coverage\nFigure 2A presents the coverage of\ncontroversies and the ratio of controversies-\nper-firm across years. There is an increase in\ncontroversy counts from 2007 until 2014 that\nwe also find in the RepRisk incident dataset.\nSimilarly, Moody’s ESG Solutions improved a\nnumber of features of its process, and the\nsurging interest in ESG likely led to more\nvigorous media coverage of ESG controversies.\nThe decrease in the controversies-per-firm ratio\nfrom 2014 onward could be due to the increase\nin ESG awareness leading firms to try to\nimprove their ESG behavior.\nFigure 2B presents the distribution by firm size\nmeasured in Total Assets (USD). If we compare\nacross size categories, firms in the largest size\nbucket have on average 15x more controversies\nthan firms in the smallest size class. This can be\nexplained by the fact that larger firms are more\nlikely to have controversies that attract media\nattention and may require company disclosure.\nWe see a similar pattern in the RepRisk\ndatabase, where the largest firms have 200x\nmore incidents, on average, than the smallest\nfirms. This relative difference may reflect that\nRepRisk’s process relies more heavily on media-based information, therefore being more skewed toward the larger firms.\nFigure 2C presents controversy distribution by sector and the number of controversies per firm in each sector. Finance, Consumer\nProducts, High-Tech, and Mining are the most populous sectors in the controversy database. In this database, Utilities displays the\nhighest controversies per firm ratio, showing more environmental-related controversies due to the nature of its businesses.\nFigure 2D presents controversy distribution by geographic region. The classification into four regions is consistent with that in\nFigure 1D, where country refers to headquarter location. Firms from the U.S. are heavily represented in this sample too. The ratio\nof controversies per firm does not vary that significantly across regions, with U.S. and Europe showing a similarly high controversy-\nper-firm ratio.\nMoody’s ESG Assessment Scores\nThe Moody’s ESG Solutions’ ESG Score (henceforth “Moody’s ESG Assessment Scores”), formerly part of the V.E ESG assessment\nmethodology8, is built around international standards and reference texts and provides the full picture of a company’s ESG\nperformance management at a given point in time. This dataset contains Moody’s ESG Assessment Scores for more than 5,000\ncompanies, normally updated every one or two years. A Moody's ESG Assessment Score is intended to measure the degree to\nwhich companies take into account and manage material ESG factors. A high Moody's ESG Assessment Score is intended to\nindicate that the company is effective at managing relationships with stakeholders and less likely to experience ESG-related\nbusiness disruptions. In order to generate the scores, Moody’s ESG Solutions analyses and scores up to 38 distinct ESG criteria that\nare framed within 40 industry-specific models.9 Moody’s ESG Assessment Scores range from 0–100, with a higher score attributed\n8 Please refer to Vigeo Eiris ESG Assessment Methodology Executive Summary (August 2020).\n11, Please refer to Vigeo Eiris ESG Assessment Methodology Executive Summary (August 2020).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 7to better performance. Improvements in Moody’s ESG Assessment Scores often correspond to corporate initiatives to improve\ntheir ESG culture.\nComparing ESG event Datasets\nA key difference between the RepRisk and Moody’s ESG Solutions’ process is that RepRisk relies exclusively on information\ncovered by the media, whereas Moody’s ESG Solutions interprets information company disclosures. Moody’s ESG Solutions\nhas fewer recorded events per firm overall. One key factor driving this is that Moody’s ESG Solutions more strongly\naggregates reports referring to the same underlying case into single events.\n4. Persistence of ESG Risk: Do Previous ESG events Predict More ESG events?\nTwo important factors drive ESG events: The nature of a firm’s business operations and the general culture within its\nmanagement that prevents ESG events from happening. Assuming that a firm’s characteristics do not change quickly over\ntime, we expect ESG risk to be persistent, meaning firms that have had ESG events in the past are more likely to experience\nESG events in the future. If persistence exists, it implies that we can utilize historical ESG events to predict future ESG\nevents.\nOne goal of this study is to create a metric that measures how much more likely a firm is to experience ESG events relative\nto its peers. This section takes a preliminary step toward that goal by investigating whether persistence exists in ESG events.\nWe find substantial evidence of persistence and show that this trait is robust after controlling for differences in size, sector,\nand region.\nThis section is structured as follows: First, we describe the construction of the measure for ESG events that we use to show\nthat ESG risk is persistent. Second, we present the empirical approach for the analysis. Third, we present empirical results\nbased on RepRisk incidents database and Moody’s ESG controversy database.\n4.1 ESG Event Rates: A Measure for ESG Risks\nWe use ESG event data that contains ESG events assigned to a firm and a date, as described in the previous section. Now, as\nwe aim to quantify the relationship between past and future ESG performance, we must derive a measure of a firm’s ESG\nevents, an ESG event rate. This measure equals the number of events that a firm experiences during one year, adjusted for 1)\nthe increase of the event-per-firm ratio over time, and 2) the fact that larger firms experience significantly more events.\nFigures 1A and 2A show how the coverage of events increases over time, 2007−2014, and stabilizes afterward. To prevent this data\ncharacteristic from distorting results, we adjust the yearly number of incidents for years before 2014 as follows:\n𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴𝑁𝑁 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 events = 𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴𝑁𝑁 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 events ∗ (𝑛𝑛2/𝑛𝑛1)\nWhere n corresponds to the number of ESG events in the corresponding year (2007−2013) and n to the average annual\n1 2\nnumber of ESG events over 2014−2019. For example, if the total number of events during 2011 was 8,000 and the average\nnumber of events during 2014−2019 was 18,000, the adjustment factor for a rate over 2011 equals 2.25.\nFurther, Figures 1B and 2B show how the coverage of ESG events increases with size. Larger firms have more ESG events, as\nthey receive more media attention, but this does not necessarily mean they have a higher ESG risk. To enable comparability\nof ESG event rates across firms of different sizes, we apply a transformation that results in transformed, yearly event rates\nthat are roughly independent of firm size. Specifically, we fit a loess curve through average incident rates for 50 size buckets,\nseparately for corporate and financials. The fitted curve is then used as a size transformation, so that the transformed event\nrate is defined as: event rate divided by the value of the loess fit corresponding to the firm’s size. Since we work with event\nrates in logarithmic space, this adjustment is equivalent to working with the residual event rate after subtracting the\naverage incident rate by size category. For example, after the scaling, an event rate of 0.5 means 50% more events than\nwould be expected given the firm’s size.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 8We refer to the ESG event rates based on the RepRisk Incident Dataset as “incident rates” and as “controversy rates” to the\nones based on Moody’s ESG Controversy Dataset, in turn.\nFigures 3A and 3B present the relationship between firm size and ESG event rates using RepRisk’s incident rates, before and\nafter being scaled by the size-implied incident rate. We see that the mean incident rate, after being scaled by size, is roughly\nconstant across size buckets for both corporates and financials.\nFigure 3 A. Incident Rates vs. Size, before scaling. B. Incident Rates vs. Size, after scaling.\nFigure 3: Based on RepRisk Incident Dataset\n4.2 Persistence Effect: Empirical Approach\nWe start the analysis using the datasets described previously. Further, to link past ESG event rates (henceforth “event rates”) with\nfuture event rates, we form five-year rolling windows at the firm level. The first two years of the window represent the past, and\nthe last two years represent the future. The residual one year in the middle acts as a “gap” and controls for the possibility of some\nincidents originating from previous related additional incidents. We form five-year rolling windows for each firm and pool all the\nfirm-cohort combinations.\nWe expect ESG culture to be more complex for the larger firms and, hence, more difficult to change over time. We also observe\nthat firms in certain industries and countries are more likely to have ESG incidents in the two datasets. In this regard, we look at\nthe persistence effect, conditional on size, sector, and region, to test the finding’s robustness.\nFormally, we can characterize each observation in our analysis with future event rates as the dependent variable and past event\nrates as the independent variable. We quantify the relationship between past and future event rates conditional on a third variable,\nwhich takes the form of size, sector, and region, respectively. We construct the analysis as follows:\n1. Order the dataset by (or sector, or region) and split it into five classes accordingly.\n2. For each class, split the dataset into buckets by past event rates.\n𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠\n3. For each bucket, compute the mean of past and future event rates.\n4. For each class, draw a scatterplot of each pair of means.\nFurther, we look at persistence over longer horizons by repeating the analysis with gaps of 2, 3, 4, and 5 years instead of 1. We\nexpect persistence to decrease somewhat over time, as firms’ characteristics change, and ESG culture also may change.\n4.3 Persistence Effect of ESG Event Rates\nAcross both ESG event datasets tested we find a strong, positive correlation between past and future ESG event rates when\ncontrolling for firm features. Figure 4 shows the test outcome based on RepRisk Incident Dataset and Figure 5 shows the test\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 9outcome using Moody’s ESG Controversy Dataset. Specifically, panel A shows the test outcome for the specific case using size as\nthe control variable, measured in total assets. Panels B and C show the test outcome by sector and region, respectively.\nFigure 4 A shows that the persistence effect varies by size in a way that is stronger for larger firms. This finding remains\nconsistent with our intuition, as larger firms have more complex structures, which makes ESG risks more persistent, as the\nimprovements or changes they may need are harder to establish.\nFigure 4 Persistence effect across size quintiles, sectors, and regions. Figure 4B shows that the effect is similarly\nstrong for all sectors, except for Health\nCare, for which the effect is weaker. This\ndifference can be explained by the fact\nthat the Health Care sector experiences\nvery few incidents, which makes the ESG\nrisk for these firms more difficult to\nquantify.\nAccording to Figure 4C, the effect is\nsimilarly strong across all four regions.\nWhen performing the test using country\nas the control variable, we find that the\neffect is stronger for developed\neconomies. This finding can be explained\nby the fact that these countries have a\nhigher coverage of incidents, which may\nreflect more ESG awareness (see Figure 11\nin the Appendix).\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 10Figure 5 Persistence effect, based on Moody’s ESG Controversy Dataset.\nFigure 5 shows similar patterns of\npersistence based on Moody’s ESG\nControversy Dataset. There are some\ndifferences by sector, which we expect\ngiven the differences in the\nmethodologies of the two data\nvendors.\nAs the gap grows larger, past information turns out to be less useful in predicting the future. Figure 6 shows how the slope\nline that depicts the relationship between past and future incident rates decrease as the gap increases. Figure 7 shows how\nthe slope line that depicts the relationship between past and future controversy rates also decrease as the gap increases.\nFigure 6 Persistence effects observed over long horizons, based on RepRisk’s Incident Dataset.\nFigure 7 Persistence effects observed over long horizons, based on Moody’s ESG Controversy Dataset.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 115. Scoring Firms on ESG Risk by Predicting ESG events\nThe main component of our approach to scoring firms on their future likelihood of experiencing ESG events relative to peers\nis predicting ESG event rates. Once we estimate predictions at the firm level, we normalize these so that they reflect firm-\nspecific performance compared with peers. The first step requires building a model that predicts future ESG event rates. We\nconstruct the model components using findings discussed in the previous section: the firm-specific ESG performance, as\nmeasured by the size-neutral number of events per year, is persistent, but decays over time. This section builds upon these\nstylized facts and outlines the process for scoring firms on ESG risk by predicting future incident rates. We illustrate our\nmethodology using RepRisk’s incident rates.\n5.1 Model Framework\nWe start by defining the components of the incident rate: 1) the asymptotic incident rate and, 2) the firm-specific factor. We refer\nto incident rate with y and to the aforementioned components with c and ry, respectively. The incident rates over the horizon,\ndecomposed into the two components follow:\nyit =𝑐𝑐i+ryit\nWhere, recall from Section 3.4, that the Incident rate for firm i on year t is defined as the size-neutral number of annual incidents.:\nWhere y𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑁𝑁 𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑜 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑁𝑁 𝑌𝑌𝑠𝑠𝑌𝑌a𝑁𝑁n𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 d) −is𝐸𝐸 t(hloe ge x(p𝑁𝑁e𝑁𝑁ct𝑁𝑁ed𝑁𝑁 𝑠𝑠v𝑁𝑁al u𝑙𝑙e𝑜𝑜 o𝐼𝐼f𝐼𝐼 t𝑐𝑐h𝑠𝑠e𝐼𝐼 𝑠𝑠lo𝑠𝑠g𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼o𝑖𝑖 f𝑖𝑖 )th|{e𝑆𝑆 i𝑠𝑠n𝑠𝑠c𝑠𝑠id𝑖𝑖,e𝐵𝐵n𝑁𝑁t 𝑙𝑙ra𝑌𝑌t𝐼𝐼e i𝑆𝑆n𝑠𝑠 t𝑐𝑐h𝐼𝐼e𝑙𝑙 𝑁𝑁d𝑖𝑖 i}s)tant\nfuture: .

The second term, , is the firm-specific component of the incident rate. The\n𝑖𝑖l→im∞𝐸𝐸(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)=𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖\n“r” stands for relative, as it can be interpreted as the percentage difference between the incident rate and the expected incident\nrate given since we are working on the log-scale.\n𝐫𝐫𝒚𝒚𝐢𝐢𝐢𝐢\n𝒄𝒄𝐢𝐢,\nPrediction of future can be expressed as:\nyit\n𝐸𝐸�y𝑠𝑠,𝐼𝐼+𝑥𝑥 �𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖]=𝐸𝐸[𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖|𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖]+𝐸𝐸�𝑁𝑁𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥�I𝑖𝑖�\nWhere represents information up to time t.

On the other hand, we leverage the autoregressive structure of the firm-specific\ncompon𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖\nent to compute a closed-form expression for variance and expectation at time t + x, described in detail in later sections.\nThe last step, after modeling the predicted incident rates, is to turn the predictions into an Event Propensity Score that\nmeasures the risk of future ESG incidents for the firm relative to the firm’s peers. Our proposed score measures this risk in terms of\nhow many standard deviations the firm is away from the m𝑦𝑦�,e an, i.e., we convert the prediction into a z-score at the peer group\nlevel:\n𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥−𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑌𝑌𝐼𝐼(𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥)\n𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝐼𝐼𝑦𝑦 𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖,𝑖𝑖+𝑥𝑥 =\nCentral Incident Tendency\n�𝐸𝐸𝑌𝑌𝑁𝑁(𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖+1)\nWe measure the baseline risk of firms in a given sector and region as the average, observed annual, size-adjusted incident rate\nacross firms and over time. Intuitively, we expect a higher central incident tendency for the Mining, Energy, and Natural Resources\nsector than for the Health Care sector, for example. Further, the baseline risk for the Mining, Energy, and Natural Resources sector\nis higher in Europe than in North America. One possible reason for this difference — we see more ESG awareness in Europe than in\nNorth America, which leads to more attention on ESG issues in the media. Similarly, the baseline risk for this industry is also higher\nin developing countries than in North America. A possible explanation is that developing countries institute fewer ESG policies,\nwhich implies a poor ESG culture that leads to more ESG-related issues. Figure 8 depicts the central incident tendency by sector\nand region.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 12Figure 8 Central Incident tendency.

We choose the\nparameters to minimize the sum of the squared error between the sample moments and the implied moments.\n5.2 Validating Our Proposed Event Propensity Scores\nBenchmarking Against the Linear Regression Approach\nWe assess score power by looking at the out-of-sample performance of the scores at ranking firms on their ESG risks within their\npeer group. We benchmark the outcome against that of a score implied by incident rates predicted using a linear regression model\nwith three lags, size interaction, and sector- and region-specific intercepts (the Appendix presents a summary table). Figure 10\nshows the correlation of actual and predicted scores within a size group for corporates and financials, separately. We find that the\nranking power of the scores implied by incident rates predicted through the structural model we propose outperforms the linear\nregression approach.\nFigure 10 Kendall’s tau of actual and predicted Proposed Event Propensity Scores one year ahead.\nWe construct the analysis as follows:\nE aba oc uh\nt\nb 2u 3c 0k e fit\nr\nmco sn tains E coa nc th\na\nib nu sc 7k 5e t\nf irms\n1. Estimate the model using the pooled panel from\n2014−2018 and predict incidence rates for 2019.\n2. Compute ESG Event Propensity Scores with the\npredicted and the actual rates.\n3. Rank firms according to our proposed scores.\n4. Use the correlation (Kendall’s tau) of the actual\nand predicted ESG scores — implied “rankings” as\na measure of goodness of fit.\nKendall’s tau11 indicates to what extent the predicted and actual scores are monotonically related, that is, to what extent the\nrankings implied by the actual and predicted scores coincide. If Kendall’s tau equals 1, there is a 100% match between the two\nrankings; if it is -1, the rankings are exactly the opposite.\nWe also see that both models are better at predicting future incident rates for larger firms. As the incident per firm ratio is\nsignificantly higher for larger firms, there is more information available for modeling firm performance, which reduces the signal-\nto-noise ratio for this part of the population. This finding is also reflected in the persistence effect, shown to be stronger for larger\nfirms, making the model’s predictive power higher for these firms.\nCase Study: Evidence from the Mining, Energy, and Natural Resources Sector\nThis case study examines the ESG performance, measured by our proposed score, of a selected firm within the Mining, Energy, and\nNatural Resources sector. Specifically, the firm is a leading gold producer headquartered in North America. Our choice was\nmotivated by a written complaint by a firm regarding their ESG ratings, claiming that incidents in the distant past were given too\nmuch weight, and that they were assigned responsibility for incidents outside their control, among other reasons.\nIn our view, these complaints summarize the challenges of creating an ESG metric, which must take into account firm-specific past\nperformance (as existing policies do not change quickly over time), as well as idiosyncratic risks firms face, given sector and region\n11 Kendall’s tau is sometimes referred to as “Kendall rank correlation coefficient.”\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 14operations. For instance, the mining sector as a whole is viewed as very high-risk for soil/water pollution and land use restrictions,\nas well as for water shortages and natural and man-made hazards. In fact, this company experienced multiple accidents, in which\nhuman error was a contributing factor reported in the year prior to a pipeline rupture. Only after such a major issue, the firm put in\nplace a policy to enable the business continuation of the troubled site.\nFigure 11 shows the Event Propensity Score for this firm relative to its peers in 2018. The peer group includes 40% of larger firms\nthat operate in the North American Mining, Energy, and Natural Resources sector. We see, according to our score, that this firm\nperformed the worst among its peers in 2018. The right panel shows how the score worsened in 2017 and recovered thereafter.\nFurther, we compare its performance across years, with the two firms whose scores were the second and third highest that year,\n“Peer 1” and “Peer 2.” These two firms show improved scores over the years, more than the firm under analysis. The difference in\ntheir 2019 scores and our firms’ 2019 score is larger than during earlier years.\nFigure 11 Event Propensity Score for Firm under analysis and its peers.\nIt is an open question whether ESG policies lead to a reduction in ESG incident rates, and if so, by how much. There is no easy way\nto tell whether the frequency with which we observe ESG incident rate changes, due to a time trend (e.g., increasing media\nattention) or a specific company’s engagement in ESG policies. We address this question by using a Difference-in-Differences\nmethodology, which we use to check whether ESG policies introduced by a company reduce the number of events it will be\nsubject to in the future.\n6. Does the Adoption of ESG Policies Lead to a Reduction of Future ESG events?\nWe have shown that some firms experience persistently elevated ESG event rates relative to firms in comparable sectors and\nregions and of comparable size. It remains to be demonstrated that elevated numbers of ESG-related events are a symptom of\nweak ESG risk management cultures versus persistent firm characteristics outside the control of the firm’s stakeholders. This\nsection demonstrates that investments in ESG policies can lead to lower ESG event rates, supporting the hypothesis of an\nimproving ESG risk management culture.\nTo establish a causal relationship between ESG policies and ESG events, we use a “Difference-in-Differences” (DiD) approach. DiD\nestablishes causation through a “natural experiment.” We can easily demonstrate the intuition behind the approach using a\nmedical example. It is reasonable to assume that people treated for a disease are likely to be sick, and sick people often recover\nwithout treatment. We can show treatment causes an improvement in health by showing that the health of the treatment group\nimproves relative to the untreated group (i.e., the control group). The improvement in the treatment group versus the control\ngroup is the so-called DiD approach (c.f., Angrist and Pischke, 2008). It is called a “natural experiment,” because the assignment to\nthe control group versus the treatment group is done by nature rather than by the scientist, as in the case of a “controlled\nexperiment.”\nLikewise, companies that introduce many ESG policies may be those that suffer the negative consequences of multiple past\nevents. Our objective is not to show that companies that have an “ESG treatment” have either low rates of ESG events or\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 15declining rates of ESG events, but rather experience a decline in rates of ESG events relative to firms that do not implement an\n“ESG Treatment.” We use substantial improvements in the Moody’s ESG Solutions’ ESG score as an indicator that a firm has made\na substantial investment in strengthening its ESG risk management culture.\nTable 1 shows companies that experienced significant ESG score improvements introduced multiple ESG improvement policies.\nFor example, ALD Automotive, a subsidiary of SocGen, received the highest-ever ESG score change in Moody's ESG Assessment\nScores dataset (18 to 67 in 2020), and, accordingly, this change occurred after presenting its new, five-year strategic plan “MOVE\n2025” and issuing €500 million green bonds, used to finance and refinance clean transportation projects and to promote\ntransition to a low-carbon future.\nTable 1 Companies with Moody's ESG Assessment Score changes and relevant policies.\nCOMPANY\nJUMP CHANGES YEAR INDUSTRY COUNTRY NOTES\nNAMES\nBusiness\nALD ALD has presented its new 5-year strategic\n49 18->67 2020 Support France\n(SocGen) plan “MOVE 2025” in 2020\nService\nPoste Transport Poste Italiane has launched “Deliver 2022”\n47 23->66 2019 Italy\nItaliane and Logistics ESG strategic plan in 2019\nIncitec Pivot has launched a 5-year healthy,\nIncitec Pivot 31 15->46 2009 Chemicals Australia\nsafety, and environment strategy in 2008\nKawasaki Transport Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha has begun to issue\n31 17->48 2010 Japan\nKisen Kaisha and Logistics Social and Environmental Report since 2009\nSource: V.E and company websites\n6.1. Difference-in-Differences Model\nThe DiD model is a statistical technique used in econometrics that attempts to mimic an experimental research design\nusing observational study data by evaluating the differential effect of a treatment on a “treatment group” versus a\n“control group” in a natural experiment (Angrist and Pischke (2009)).\nDiD has become one of the most popular research designs used to evaluate causal effects of policy interventions. In its\ncanonical format, there are two time periods and two groups: In the first period, no one is treated, and in the second\nperiod, the units in the first group are treated (the treated group), and the units in the second group are not (the control\ngroup).\nConsider the DiD model setting as:\n𝑁𝑁 𝑇𝑇\n′\nin which, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖+�𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖+𝑐𝑐𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,\n𝑖𝑖=2 𝑖𝑖=1\n1. is the transformed number of events for company at time ;\n2. ′ is the post-treatment dummy, and if and only if the firm has received the treatment at time ;\n3. 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the time dummy; 𝑠𝑠 𝐼𝐼\n4. 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the treatment dummy; 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =1 𝑠𝑠 𝐼𝐼\n5.\n𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖\nis the error term.\n𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖\nAs was\nth𝜖𝜖e𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖\ncase in the 2-sample, 2-period DiD model above, we are interested in here, because it tells that, on average,\nthere will be fewer ESG events after the treatment.\n𝑐𝑐\nc x 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐𝐴𝐴𝑜𝑜𝑁𝑁\nIn our case, we define the treatment group, which consists of the firms that experienced large improvements in their ESG\nscores, and the control group, which consists of the firms that did not. We further define the treatment group into two\nsubgroups. One includes the companies which have taken the moderate ESG policies and experienced their maximum ESG\nscore changes larger than 10. The other includes the companies that have implemented substantial ESG policies and have\nexperienced maximum ESG score changes larger than 15.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 16In a word, if we define as the company ’s ESG score change at year , we have:\n1.

The logic follows that, if there are multiple observations over time, the pre- and post-treatment instances are\nimplicitly assumed to be independent by the model. If the observations are, in fact, correlated, this assumption leaves us with a\nfalse impression of strong evidence against the null from multiple observations, which we (incorrectly) treat as unrelated. The\nauthors evaluate several methods for addressing the problem. The solution that we adopt is equivalent to using heteroskedasticity\nand autocorrelation consistent standard errors, as proposed in the seminal paper by Newey and West (1987). Bertrand et al. (2004)\nhave shown it to efficiently resolve the false rejection problem on a randomly generated, autocorrelated dataset. The method has\nthe additional advantage of being widely used and understood.\n6.2 Difference-in-Differences Results\nTable 2 DiD Regression Results using RepRisk Incidents.\nMODERATE TREATMENT SUBSTANTIAL TREATMENT\nDEPENDENT POST_TREATMENT POST_TREATMENT\nSTD ERROR T-VALUE STD ERROR T-VALUE\nVARIABLE COEFFICIENT COEFFICIENT\nTransformed -0.14*** 0.04 -3.62 -0.27*** 0.07 -3.98\nCorrected\n-0.14** 0.05 -2.66 -0.27*** 0.08 -3.31\nTransformed\nSize 19,909 14,367\nNote: Significance cutoff: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1\nTable 3 Model Results by Size.\n$1 BILLION $10 BILLION $100 BILLION $1 TRILLION\nNo Treatment 1.9 8.4 20.0 82\nAfter\nModerate 1.8(2.6%) 8.1(3.4%) 18.2(9.1%) 73.4(17.6%)\nTreatment\nAfter\nSubstantial 1.8(5.7%) 7.8(6.7%) 16.4(17.9%) 54(34.1%)\nTreatment\nNote: Table shows the number of RepRisk incidents and the percentage reduction from the No Treatment group (in the parentheses)\nTable 2 implies that, on average, there will be fewer RepRisk incidents if a company made\nmoderate improvements in ESG policies, and fewer RepRisk incidents if a company made\nsubstantial improvements in ESG policies, in w0h.i1c4h xa s𝐴𝐴c𝑐𝑐a𝑠𝑠li𝑠𝑠n𝑠𝑠g𝑛𝑛 𝑠𝑠fa c𝑜𝑜t𝑠𝑠o𝑐𝑐r i𝐴𝐴s𝑜𝑜 a𝑁𝑁 s ize-specific factor, and the larger the size of the\ncompany, the larger the scaling factor is.

Substantial ESG policies will reduce the incidents and controversy numbers by 18%.\nThe estimated reduction is greater for large companies. As with the finding that larger companies have more persistence in\nESG incidents, this finding may reflect a better “signal to noise ratio” when inferring a latent variable (the ESG risk\nmanagement culture) from ESG incidents of a large firm relative to a small firm.\nThis section introduces a new finding. Future work will determine the extent to which the finding is robust to alternative\nspecifications, as well as different ESG incident datasets. We will also test whether or not the impact changes if we focus on\nEnvironmental incidents and policies, Societal incidents and policies, and Governance incidents and policies. Finally, we will\nevaluate the extent to which the rejection of the null hypothesis is robust to alternative methods for calculating the P value.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 177. Summary\nWe find that ESG event risk persists, show how to measure this phenomenon, and present a method for scoring firms\nbased on their ESG risks with respect to their peers. This persistence finding is consistent with two explanations: differences\nin ESG events rates (after controlling for size, region, and sector) can be explained by either differences in inherent firm\ncharacteristics outside the control of the firm’s stakeholders or, alternatively, differences in ESG risk management cultures.\nAdditionally, we find that firms that have improved their ESG policies, as indicated by an improved Moody’s ESG Solution’s\nESG Score, lower their future rate of ESG events, as measured by both RepRisk Events and Moody’s ESG Controversies\nusing a DiD approach. The DiD finding is consistent with the second explanation: that there is an ESG Risk Management\nculture that persists over time but can be improved through improvements in ESG policies.\nOur research includes three related, forthcoming whitepapers. The first investigates the business impact of ESG events.\nPreliminary findings show significant effects of ESG-related news on firms’ abnormal stock returns, with the magnitude of\nthe effect dependent on event characteristics and a firm’s history of events. The second paper investigates whether ESG\nperformance retains impact upon business outcomes, if we control for firm size or EDF measure. Preliminary findings\nindicate that a minority of firms with severe ESG issues exhibit inferior asset and equity returns. However, we find no\nevidence that minor ESG events (which occasionally befall most firms) have a similar effect. The third paper aims to extend\nthe second result in this paper: that policy interventions intended to promote a stronger ESG risk management culture\nreduce the likelihood of future ESG events. Specifically, we examine the extent to which the result remains consistent with\nalternative specifications, event datasets, and statistical methods.\nWe suggest three areas for future research related to the measurement of persistence in ESG events. As mentioned, ESG\nevents with a higher severity degree are expected to be more expensive for firms. Since, throughout this paper, we focus on\nthe likelihood for overall ESG events, the first area for development is to measure the likelihood for ESG events with\ndifferent severity degrees. Further, the intrinsic characteristics of firms make them susceptible to specific types of ESG risk;\nfor example, a mining firm is exposed to more E-type risk than a financial firm. In this regard, the second area for future\nwork aims to measure Environmental, Social, and Governance event risk separately. The third forthcoming whitepaper\nsuggests that the introduction of policies advocating for a stronger ESG risk management culture reduces the persistence of\nESG risk. In that regard, predicting changes in event rates is a powerful complement for a forward-looking measure of ESG\nrisk and constitutes the third area for future research.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 18Appendix\nRobustness of the Persistence Effect using RepRisk’s Incident Dataset\nOne major concern — many corporate ESG incidents play out over an extended period, leading to the incidents being recorded\nover a long span and in multiple media sources. RepRisk takes incidents only once and from the most influential source, and only\nadds the incident again if the risk profile of the incident changes. Specifically, multiple entries about the same ESG incident can\noccur if 1) if a new development is related to the same incident, 2) the incident appears in a more influential source, and/or 3) the\nincident appears again for the same company in the same country after six weeks. In order to ensure that duplicated incidents do\nnot drive the outcome of the analysis, we test the robustness of the persistence effect after making the following exclusions with\ndifferent stringencies at the firm-level:\nType 1: Exactly the same countries, issues and severity, reach, and novelty.\nType 2: Exactly the same countries and issues.\nType 3: Exactly the same issues and at least one country that coincides or exactly the same countries and at least one issue that coincides.\nResults are robust for different sample constructions. Identification remains conservative, as a firm can have two separate incidents\nwith the same issue, in the same country, which we exclude. This process constitutes an important robustness check, which rules\nout the possibility of too many incidents and duplicated incidents driving the analysis outcome, and it confirms our view that\nincidents recorded subsequent to a major ESG incident weights ESG incidents by their importance, a quality characteristic of\nRepRisk’s data, but our method does not drive the outcome.\nPersistence Effect for Selected Countries\nFigure 12 shows the persistence effect with country as the control variable, for countries with more than 27 firms top-18 countries\nby number of firms. Overall, the persistence effect is stronger for most of the developed economies, for which we also find a\nhigher coverage of incidents.\nFigure 12 Persistence effect across selected countries/regions.\nMOODY’S ANALYTICS MEASURING PERSISTENCE IN ESG RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE 19Baseline Regression\nTable 4 reports summaries of the four models used to analyze incident rates in the panel. Model (1) models the incident rate as an\nAR 1 process; Model (2) as an AR 3 process; Model (3) uses size, sector, and region-specific dummies; and Model (4) combines the\nAR 3 with size, sector, and region-specific intercepts and size interaction with the first lag. We observe that the beta coefficients of\nthe explanatory variables are below 1 across models. If the coefficients equal 1, that would mean that future incident rates are not\nexpected to change with respect to past incident rates. The coefficients in Table 2 indicate that firms are expected to decrease\n(improve) their ESG incident rates in the future.\nTable 4 Linear autoregressive models for the incident rate.\nModel (4): Baseline Regression\nINCIDENT RATE\nI NDEPENDENT VARIABLE (1) (2) (3) (4)\nIncident rate: Lag 1 0.73*** 0.49*** 0.35***\nIncident rate: Lag 2 0.23*** 0.22***\nIncident rate: Lag 3 0.12*** 0.12***\nLag 1: Size: 20%-40% 0.08***\nLag 1: Size: 40%-60% 0.12***\nLag 1: Size: 60%-80% 0.15***\nLag 1: Size: 80%-100% 0.20***\nSize: 40%-60% 0.12*** 0.09***\nSize: 60%-80% 0.18*** 0.15***\nSize: 80%-100% 0.23*** 0.22***\nSector: Mining 0.33*** 0.09***\nSector: Utilities -0.04* 0.03*\nSector: Trade 0.25*** 0.16***\nSector: HiTech 0.06** 0.07***\nSector: Business.
